Join us as we explore the story of the greatest team in basketball and the iconic figure who propelled them to unprecedented heights.\n\nThe Rise of the Chicago Bulls\n\nThe Early Years\n\nThe Chicago Bulls, a professional basketball team based in Chicago, Illinois, began their journey in the NBA in 1966. In their early years, the team struggled to find success and establish themselves as a formidable force in the league. Despite their efforts, the Bulls faced numerous challenges and failed to make a significant impact on the basketball scene.\n\nThe Arrival of Michael Jordan\n\nHowever, everything changed for the Chicago Bulls in 1984 when they selected Michael Jordan as the third overall pick in the NBA draft. Jordan, a talented and charismatic player, brought a new level of excitement and skill to the team.

Jordan’s sensational performances on the court helped the Bulls gain national attention and transformed them into a powerhouse of basketball.\n\nUnder Jordan’s leadership, the Bulls experienced a remarkable transformation, going from a struggling team to a dominant force in the NBA. Jordan’s unparalleled skills and competitive drive elevated the performance of his teammates, and together they formed an unstoppable unit. The chemistry and camaraderie among the players were evident, and it reflected in their exceptional teamwork and remarkable achievements.\n\nDuring Jordan’s tenure with the Bulls, the team achieved six NBA championships in the span of eight years, solidifying their place in basketball history. Their success was not limited to championships alone; the Bulls also set numerous records and established an unprecedented level of dominance in the league.\n\nThe arrival of Michael Jordan undoubtedly changed the trajectory of the Chicago Bulls, propelling them to become one of the greatest teams in basketball history.

Through their perseverance and the exceptional talent of Jordan, the Bulls transformed into a team that will always be remembered as one of the greatest in basketball.\n\nBuilding the Dream Team\n\nThe Drafting of Scottie Pippen\n\nOne of the key factors that contributed to the Chicago Bulls becoming the greatest team in basketball was the drafting of Scottie Pippen. Pippen was selected by the Bulls in the 1987 NBA Draft as the fifth overall pick. His exceptional athleticism, defensive skills, and versatility made him the perfect complement to Michael Jordan.\n\nPippen quickly established himself as one of the league’s premier players, forming a formidable duo with Jordan. His ability to defend multiple positions and contribute offensively made him an invaluable asset to the team. With Pippen on board, the Bulls had a solid foundation for their dream team.\n\nAcquiring Dennis Rodman\n\nAnother crucial move in building the dream team was the acquisition of Dennis Rodman. Rodman, known for his incredible rebounding ability and defensive prowess, was traded to the Bulls in 1995. His unique playing style and relentless hustle perfectly fit into the team’s strategy.\n\nRodman’s rebounding skills provided the Bulls with numerous second-chance opportunities, while his tenacious defense disrupted opponents’ offenses. His unselfishness and willingness to do the dirty work complemented the scoring prowess of Jordan and Pippen. With Rodman on the roster, the Bulls became an even more formidable force in the league.\n\nThe Addition of Phil Jackson as Head Coach\n\nNo discussion about the greatest team in basketball can be complete without mentioning the addition of Phil Jackson as the head coach. Jackson’s hiring in 1989 marked the beginning of an era of unparalleled success for the Bulls. His innovative coaching strategies and ability to manage egos proved to be instrumental in the team’s achievements.\n\nUnder Jackson’s guidance, the Bulls embraced a selfless style of play and a strong team-oriented mentality. His emphasis on defense and teamwork transformed the Bulls into a formidable unit that was virtually unstoppable. Jackson’s leadership and ability to get the best out of his players played a pivotal role in the Bulls’ dominance.\n\nIn conclusion, the Chicago Bulls’ journey to becoming the greatest team in basketball was shaped by several key elements. The drafting of Scottie Pippen provided the team with a versatile and dynamic player, while the acquisition of Dennis Rodman brought unmatched rebounding and defensive skills. However, it was the addition of Phil Jackson as head coach that truly transformed the Bulls into a cohesive and unstoppable force. Together, these elements formed the foundation of the dream team that will forever be remembered as the greatest in basketball history.\n\nDominance and Championships\n\nThree-Peat: 1991-1993\n\nDuring the early 1990s, the Chicago Bulls, led by the legendary Michael Jordan, established themselves as one of the most dominant teams in basketball history.

The Bulls were a great team and Jordan had a great supporting cast. No one can deny that: He didn’t win by himself. But how great were the Bulls? Did Jordan ever face true competition? Let’s answer these questions.\n\nThe First “Three-Peat” (1991-1993)\n\nThe Bulls starting center was Bill Cartwright. During these three seasons Cartwright averaged 7.9 PPG, 5.1 RPG and 0.2 BPG. In the playoffs he wasn’t any better with averages of 7.0 PPG, 4.5 RPG and 0.2 BPG.\n\nThe starting power forward was Horace Grant. He was a 6'10\" player, but he wasn’t a dominant big man. He wasn’t even an All-Star during this time, nor was he a player that could dominate the post, but he was a good rebounder.\n\nScottie Pippen, the small forward, was in his prime during this time, but people overrate him. When the Bulls won their first title in 1991, Pippen didn’t even make the All-Star team. Yes, he was an All-Star in the 1990 season, but his stats were actually better in 1991.\n\nThe point of the All-Star argument is not to prove that Pippen wasn’t a great sidekick, but merely to prove that Jordan didn’t have the best small forward of his generation—as many people claim. The All-NBA team is another way to prove this. Pippen didn’t make the All-NBA team (not even the third team) in the 1991 season.\n\nSo Jordan won the 1991 NBA championship with teammates that didn’t make the All-Star team or the All-NBA team. Pippen didn’t even make the All-Defensive first team in 1991. He made the All-Defensive First team and the All-NBA second team in the 1992 season. He again made the All-Defensive First team in 1993, but he proved that he wasn’t the best at his position when he barely made the All-NBA team when he was selected to the third team.\n\nJohn Paxson was one of the Bulls’ starting guards. In the regular season he averaged 6.9 PPG, 1.1 RPG, 3.1 APG and in the playoffs he averaged 7.0 PPG, 1.1 RPG and 2.5 APG. He was a good three-point shooter, but his shooting percentage can be misleading. During the three regular seasons of 1991-1993, he attempted 96, 44, and 41 three-point shots, respectively. Combining those three seasons, Paxson averaged just 0.8 three-point shot attempts. In the playoffs he averaged 1.1 three-point shot attempts. Those numbers are too low to really give him credit for his high three-point percentage. Paxson is not the shooter people claim he was when the Bulls were winning titles.\n\nThe remaining cast includes players such as B.J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Craig Hodges, Will Perdue and Scott Williams, among others. None of them—except for Armstrong—were any better than the starters.\n\nArmstrong is another shooter people tend to overrate. He was a good shooter in 1993, but before that, he was just like Paxson. He had a high shooting percentage, but with few shot attempts. Armstrong also missed a lot of games during this time. In the 1991 and 1992 playoffs he averaged only 0.5 three-point shot attempts. Even with few attempts, he shot 29.4 percent from three-point line in the 1992 playoffs.\n\nThis is the supporting cast Jordan had in his first three championships. This was a great group of players, but as you can see, Jordan’s supporting cast is overrated. You may think there was no competition if Jordan won with this group of misfits, but let’s see what this team had to go through.\n\n1991\n\nThe Bulls first opponent in the playoffs was the New York Knicks. Patrick Ewing made the All-NBA second team. He also made the All-Star team.\n\nIn the Semifinals the Bulls met the Philadelphia 76ers. Charles Barkley was 4th in the Most Valuable Player award (MVP) voting. He made the All-NBA first team to go along with an All-Star team selection. His teammate, Hersey Hawkins, made the All-Star team too.\n\nIn the next round, the Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls faced the defending champion Detroit Pistons. They were not only the defending champions, they also were the third seed in the East, and had eliminated the East's second seed, the Boston Celtics. That Celtics team still had Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish. They also had Reggie Lewis. Although they were old and not the same players they were in the 1980s, the Celtics were still good enough to win 56 games, securing the second seed in the East, and the 4th seed in the league.\n\nThat Pistons team, known as the “Bad Boys,” is considered one the greatest defensive teams in the history of the NBA. During the '91 season, they were first in opponent points per game and fourth in defensive rating. Joe Dumars made the All-NBA third team and the All-Defensive second team. He made the All-Star team too. Dennis Rodman was a member of the All-Defensive first team. He was also the Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY).\n\nIn the last round, the NBA Finals, the Bulls faced the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers won 58 games in the regular season, good for third place in the league. They were second in opponent points per game and fifth in defensive rating. Magic Johnson was the runner-up for the MVP award, and was also a member of the All-NBA first team. His teammate, James Worthy, joined him as a member of the All-Star team. In one single playoff run, Jordan beat four all-time greats: Ewing, Barkley, Thomas, and Johnson.\n\n1992\n\nIn the first round the Bulls faced the Miami Heat. The Heat had a member of the All-Rookie First team (Steve Smith).\n\nThe Bulls second round opponent was the Knicks. That Knicks team is considered one of the greatest defensive teams in NBA history. They were second in both opponent points per game and defensive rating. Ewing was 5th in MVP voting. He also made the All-NBA second team and the All-Star team. He was a member of the All-Defensive second team.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals the Bulls met the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavaliers had won 57 games, which was the second most victories in the NBA. Brad Daugherty and Mark Price made the All-NBA third team and the All-Star team. Larry Nance made the All-Defensive second team, and Terrell Brando was a member of the All-Rookie Second team.\n\nIn the NBA Finals Jordan and the Bulls faced Clyde Drexler and Portland Trail Blazers. Just like the Cavaliers, the Blazers had won 57 games. The Blazers were also third in defensive rating. Buck Williams had made the All-Defensive second team, and Drexler was the runner-up for the MVP award—he also made the All-NBA first team and All-Star team.\n\n1993\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks were the first team the Bulls played in the playoffs. Dominique Wilkins was 5th in MVP voting. He was also a member of the All-NBA second team and the All-Star team.\n\nThe Bulls faced the Cavaliers in the semi-final round. This Cavaliers team was fourth in opponent points per game and sixth in defensive rating. Price was a member of the All-NBA first team, and Nance made the All-Defensive second team. The Cavaliers also had three members of the All-Star team (Daugherty, Price and Nance).\n\nThe Bulls would then meet the Knicks for the third straight time in the Eastern Conference Finals. This time the Knicks had won 60 games, which was good for first in the East and second overall in the league. This means that for the first time in their championship runs the Bulls didn’t have home-court advantage. The Knicks, already considered one of the greatest defensive teams in NBA history, were first in both opponent points per game and defensive rating. Ewing was 4th in MVP voting. He again was part of the All-NBA second team and the All-Star team. John Starks was a member of the All-Defensive second team. Knicks coach, Pat Riley, was Coach of the Year.\n\nWhen the Bulls eliminated the Knicks, they met the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals. For the second time during the postseason the Bulls didn’t have home-court advantage. The Suns had won 62 games during the regular season, which was good for the most wins in the NBA. They were 9th in defensive rating. Charles Barkley, who was now playing for the Suns, was the league’s MVP. He was also a member of the All-NBA first team and the All-Star team. Dan Majerle made the All-Defensive second team and the All-Star team. Keep in mind that Majerle was guarding Jordan, and that the Suns were the first seed in the league, yet Jordan averaged 41.0 ppg in this series. The Bulls were the third seed in the NBA, and in their path to their third straight championship, they beat the first (Suns) and second (Knicks) seeds, making one of the greatest championship runs in NBA history.\n\nYou can see the domination the Bulls had against the tough competition. Before we move on to the second “three-peat” Bulls team, let’s clarify something here. I’m not saying Jordan had a weak supporting cast, just that it’s overrated. People use the 1994 season to prove Jordan did have a great supporting cast or that he wasn’t that important. The Bulls won 55 games without Jordan that season, just 2 less wins than in 1993, when Jordan was on the roster.\n\nHow did the Bulls win 55 games without Jordan?\n\nFirst of all, the only important piece that was missing from the championship team was Jordan. The Bulls still had Pippen, Grant, Cartwright, Paxson, Armstrong, Williams, King and head coach Phil Jackson PLUS newcomers Toni Kukoc, Steve Kerr and Luc Longley. Not only the Bulls were able to keep their head coach, second best player, and all of the role players, but they also added THREE role players that would later become important in the second “three-peat”. The reason why the Bulls won 57 games in 1993 was because they were two-time defending champions. Teams always want to beat the defending champions, so they would throw everything at the Bulls. Also, teams and players wanted to beat Jordan. In 1994 teams didn’t have the same approach because Jordan was retired. So the 1994 Bulls didn’t have to carry the burden the 1993 Bulls had to. Combine all this with the great coaching of Jackson, and you have 55 wins. I don’t understand what the big deal with this is. The Bulls didn’t even win the NBA championship after they had won it the previous three seasons with Jordan on the roster. What about the 1995 season? The Bulls were struggling for a playoff berth. They were 34-31 before Jordan made his return. With Jordan, they finished the season 13-4.\n\nNow let’s take a look at the second “three-peat” Bulls team.\n\nThe Second “three-peat” (1996-1998)\n\nIn the second “three-peat” the Bulls had Luc Longley as their starting center. He was slightly better than Cartwright, averaging stats like 9.9 ppg, 5.5 rpg and 1.2 bpg during this time. In the playoffs he had 7.6 ppg, 4.7 rpg and 1.0 bpg. Dennis Rodman was the starting power forward for the Bulls. At 6’7 he was a great defensive player and rebounder, but his offensive game was mediocre. He averaged 5.2 ppg. In the playoffs he wasn’t any different when he averaged just 5.4 ppg. He made the All-Defensive team just once during this time (1996). We know Rodman was a rebounding machine, but few know that he didn’t average 10 boards in the 1997 playoffs. He didn’t even average 9 boards in the 1997 and 1998 Finals. Even Rodman’s rebounding numbers can be misleading. Longley and Rodman combined for just 15 points. This is probably the weakest offensively starting PF-Center duo on an NBA championship team. Pippen was no longer in his prime. We already know he wasn’t the best small forward of his generation. He made the All-Defensive First team in each season but he made the All-NBA First team just once, in the 1996 season. He made the All-NBA Second team during the 1997 and 1998 seasons, but he failed to make the All-Star team (again), but he was selected to the All-NBA third team. So we have Jordan winning another title with his best teammate missing the All-Star team and barely making the All-NBA team.\n\nAnother fact about Pippen that people tend to forget is that during these three seasons he averaged 17.3 ppg in the playoffs while shooting 40.8 % from the field. And this was Jordan’s best teammate. Ron Harper was the other Bulls guard. His averages in the regular season were 7.7 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 2.7 apg. In the playoffs he averaged 7.6 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 2.6 apg. Toni Kukoc was the backup forward. He won the Sixth Man of the Year award in 1996. Steve Kerr was the backup guard. He’s really the only good shooter the Bulls had for more than 1 season during the championship years, but even his shooting gets overrated. In the regular season he was great, but in the playoffs his shooting wasn’t as great. In the 1996 and 1997 playoffs he shot 32.1 % and 38.1 % from the three-point line, respectively. Those are the numbers from an average shooter. A player like Kerr should be over 40 %, which he was in the 1998 playoffs. But here again we can see how people overrate Jordan’s supporting cast. The remaining supporting cast included Bill Wennington, Jud Buechler, Randy Brown, and Brian Williams, among others.\n\nNow that we know Jordan’s supporting cast from the second “three-peat”, let’s take a look at the competition.\n\n1996\n\nThis season was a little different for the Bulls because they would meet some pretty good duos. In the First round the Bulls played against the Heat. The Heat won just 42 games but they were fifth in opponent points per game and sixth in Defensive Rating.\n\nThey had the duo of Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning. Mourning was an All-Star. The Heat were also coached by Riley.\n\nIn the Second round the Bulls faced the Knicks (again). The Knicks were fourth in both Opponent points per game and Defensive Rating. Ewing was an All-Star.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals the Bulls faced the Orlando Magic. The Magic, having won 60 games during the regular season, were the third seed in the league. They also had a powerful duo in Anfernee Hardaway and Shaquille O’Neal. Hardaway was 3rd in MVP voting and he was also a member of the All-NBA First team. O’Neal was a member of the All-NBA Third team. Horace Grant, now with Oralndo, made the All-Defensive Second team. Hardaway and O’Neal were teammates on the All-Star team.\n\nThe Bulls’ NBA Finals opponent, the Seattle Supersonics, were the second seed in the league after they won 64 games. They were 8th in Opponent points per game and second in Defensive Rating. This team had swept the defending champion Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Semifinals. The Bulls had to deal with another powerful duo in Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp. Payton was a member of the All-Defensive First team. He had won the DPOY and he led the league in steals. Payton and Kemp were teammates on the All-Star team.\n\n1997\n\nThis season was one of the toughest for the Bulls.\n\nTheir First round opponent, the Washington Bullets, had an All-Star in Chris Webber.\n\nIn the Semifinals the Bulls faced the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks were the 4th seed in the East having won 56 games. They were fourth in Opponent points per game and third in Defensive Rating. Dikembe Mutombo had made the All-Defensive First team and he was also the DPOY. Mookie Blaylock was a member of the All-Defensive Second team and he also led the league in steals. Mutombo and Christian Laettner were members of the All-Star team. The Hawks were also coached by Lenny Wilkins.\n\nAfter eliminating a tough Hawks team, the Bulls met a tougher team in the Miami Heat during the Eastern Conference Finals. The Heat had won 61 games, which was good for the third seed in the league. This team was third in Opponents points per game and first in Defensive Rating. For the second straight postseason the Bulls had to deal with the duo of Hardaway and Mourning. Hardaway was 4th in MVP voting and he made the All-NBA First team and the All-Star team. P.J. Brown was a member of the All-Defensive Second team. The Heat also had the Most Improved Player award winner (Isaac Austin). Heat coach Pat Riley had won the Coach of the Year award. Remember that Riley was the coach of the early 90's Knicks.\n\nIt got even tougher for the Bulls in the NBA Finals when they faced the Utah Jazz. The Jazz owned the second seed in the league when they won 64 games. They were 8th in Opponent points per game and 9th in Defensive Rating. This team featured one of the greatest duos in NBA history in Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone is considered as one of the three greatest power forwards ever, while Stockton is considered as one of the three greatest point guards ever. Malone was the league MVP and was also a member of the All-NBA First team and All-Defensive First team.  Stockton was a member of the All-NBA Third team and the All-Defensive Second team. They both made the All-Star team. For those who say that this wasn’t a competitive era, the 1997 season featured ten 50-win teams, including three 60-win teams.\n\n1998\n\nIn the First round the Bulls faced the New Jersey Nets. The Nets had an All-Star in Jayson Williams and a member of the All-Rookie First team (Keith Van horn).\n\nTheir second round opponent, the Charlotte Hornets, had a member of the All-NBA third team (Glen Rice).\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals the Bulls faced a tough Indiana Pacers team. This team was fifth in both Opponent points per game and Defensive Rating. Reggie Miller had made the All-NBA Third team. His teammate, Rick Smits, joined him on the All-Star team. Pacers coach, Larry Bird had won the Coach of the Year award.\n\nFor the second straight time, the Bulls met the Jazz in the NBA Finals. This time the Jazz had home-court advantage after they secured the first seed in the league with 62 wins. Although the Bulls had won 62 games too, the Jazz held the tiebreaker. So for the second time in the NBA Finals the Bulls didn’t have home-court advantage. They had to deal with the powerful duo of Malone and Stockton (again). This Jazz team had swept a Lakers team that won 61 games and featured four players that made the All-Star team that same season (Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant, Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel). Malone made the All-NBA First team and All-Defensive First team. He was the runner-up for the MVP award.\n\nThe 1998 season also featured ten 50-win teams, including four 60-win teams.\n\nNow that we have learned the competition Jordan and the Bulls had to face, we can get to some conclusions. In his path to 6 titles, Jordan beat the likes of Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Clyde Drexler, Dominique Wilkins, Charles Barkley (twice), Patrick Ewing (four times), Reggie Miller, Dikembe Mutombo, as well as the duos of Shaquille O’Neal and Anfernee Hardaway, Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, Tim Hardaway and Alonzo Mourning (twice), and John Stockton and Karl Malone (twice).\n\nWith Jordan on the roster the Bulls faced seven 60-win teams and twelve 55-win teams in the playoffs since the 1991 season (1995 excluded) and defeated all of them. Their playoff record against 60-win teams was 28-11 (.718), and their record against 55-win teams was 48-20 (.706). They defeated two of the top three teams in the league in four of their six championship runs: 1992 (Cavaliers and Blazers), 1993 (Knicks and Suns), 1996 (Magic and Sonics), and 1997 (Heat and Jazz). They won two Finals series without home-court advantage (1993 & 1998) and three of their six titles have been clinched on the road (1991, 1993 & 1998). In just six years the Bulls defeated ten teams in the playoffs that were either the first, second or third seed in the entire league, including all six of their Finals opponents. Their playoff record against these teams was 40-16 (.714). Jordan averaged 32.6 ppg while shooting 46.1 % from the field against top three teams.\n\nFurthermore, in just 6 postseasons the Bulls had to face 14 top-ten teams in Defensive Ratings. Two of those were first, four were top-three, and eight were top-five. Of those 14 teams, five were in the Finals. Against these 14 teams, Jordan averaged 30.3 while shooting 47.0 % from the field. The Bulls were also 55-24 (.696) against these teams.\n\nTo the people that say Jordan never faced a defensive team like the 2004 Pistons or the 2008 Celtics, let me tell you that he did. The “Bad Boys” Pistons of the late 80's and early 90's is considered one of the greatest defensive teams in NBA history. The Bulls faced this team only once in their six title runs (1991), but they had met them in three previous postseasons (1988, 1989 and 1990). The 90's Knicks is another team that is considered as one of the greatest defensive teams ever. The Bulls beat them four times (1991, 1992, 1993 and 1996). Also, guarding Jordan was one All-Defensive First team member (Payton), three All-Defensive Second team members (Dumars, Starks and Majerle) and one DPOY (Payton). Even Rodman, who won the DPOY and made the All-Defensive First team in 1991, guarded Jordan on some spots. So in the series with the Pistons in 1991 Jordan had to go against TWO All-Defensive team members.\n\nUnlike any other team with multiple titles, Jordan’s Bulls lacked two important pieces: A dominant big man (or a center) and a point guard. The only other team to win a title without a dominant big man is the Golden State Warriors in the 1974-75 season. Every other team in NBA history has won the NBA championship with the help of a dominant big man, and some of them had a point guard too. It’s not like there weren’t any dominant big men in the NBA. The Bulls had to deal with Laimbeer, Ewing, O’Neal, Mourning, Kemp, Daugherty and Mutombo. Another impressive fact is that since the 1988-89 season, Jordan NEVER had a teammate averaging a double-double in the playoffs, and just once he had a teammate averaging a double-double in the regular season (Horace Grant, 1992). The 1993 Finals is the only Finals series in which Jordan had a teammate averaging a double-double.\n\nWe can see Jordan had a good supporting cast that helped him win six NBA Championships. But we saw they tend to get overrated. We also saw that the Bulls did face great competition.\n\nThe 1990's Chicago Bulls are the greatest dynasty in NBA history. They have shown they can compete in any era.\n\n"

        "raw_content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider.\n\nHow Michael Jordan's best Chicago Bulls squad would have stacked up against the greatest NBA teams of all time\n\nWe would have loved to see Jordan and his 1995-96 Bulls take on these five championship teams\n\nOver the course of his illustrious NBA career with the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan provided us with many memorable playoff matchups. There were those early battles with the \"Bad Boy\" Detroit Pistons, the Finals showdown against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers, which served as a passing of the torch of sorts, and the back-to-back Finals meetings with the Utah Jazz to name a few.\n\nYet while the lore of the Jordan-era Bulls will live on forever, they were only at the peak of their power as a team for a finite amount of time. While the Bulls thoroughly dominated the majority of the '90s, there were plenty of other great championship teams -- before and after -- that didn't get an opportunity to square off against Chicago at the height of its powers.\n\nShortly after the Bulls' dynasty came to an end, another powerhouse emerged in the Lakers, led by the lethal duo of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. It would have been something to see Jordan's Bulls and Bryant's Lakers go head-to-head. Same for the Golden State Warriors, specifically the superteam consisting of Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. That would have been a battle.\n\nSo what if Jordan's Bulls had the chance to go up against some of the other legendary NBA teams ever assembled? For this exercise, we'll match them up against five of the greatest teams we would have loved to see Jordan and the Bulls square off against in a postseason setting while Chicago was at its best. Considering the 1995-96 Bulls broke a league record by winning a franchise-record 72 games in the regular season and then only lost three playoff games before winning the title, we'll use that season's team to represent the Bulls at their very best. A glance at their '95-96 season:\n\nAs you can see, that Chicago team was dangerously good. That said, here are the five teams -- all NBA champions -- that we would have loved to see those Bulls battle against in a playoff setting:\n\n1985-86 Boston Celtics\n\nDespite the fact that both Chicago and Boston were in the same conference and made annual trips to the postseason throughout the 1980s and early '90s, Michael Jordan and the Bulls only ran into Larry Bird's Celtics twice in the playoffs -- in 1986 and 1987. Both meetings occurred in the first round of the postseason, and the Celtics swept both series, 3-0.\n\nJordan was still just a pup in the league at that point, though, as these meetings occurred during his second and third seasons in the league, respectively. He wasn't fully developed physically, or as a player at that point, and he hadn't yet learned what it took to win at the highest level. Also, Jordan didn't have his supporting cast. Both of Jordan's postseason matchups against the Celtics came before Scottie Pippen was on Chicago's roster, and obviously well before Dennis Rodman was added to the mix. It was also before Phil Jackson was brought on to coach the team.\n\nWhile Jordan's Bulls weren't in full form yet, the Celtics were at their zenith as a team. They went to four straight Finals from 1983 to 1987, winning two of them. The 1985-86 Celtics had five future Hall of Famers on the roster -- Larry Bird, Dennis Johnson, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Bill Walton -- and won 67 regular-season games. Boston also lost just three times during the postseason on its way to a title. As such, it is widely regarded as one of the best teams in NBA history, and arguably the best Celtics squad of all time.\n\nSo while Jordan and the Bulls technically did face off against the '85-86 Celtics in the playoffs, it would have been better and so much more exciting to see the two legends in Jordan and Bird square off against each other while both were in the midst of their primes and equipped with their best supporting casts. The chess match between the two all-time legends would have been fascinating to see. In addition to getting to see peak Jordan and peak Bird go head-to-head, it would have been great to see Pippen try his hand at slowing Bird, and Rodman battle on the boards against the likes of Kevin McHale and Robert Parrish. The Celtics got the best of the Bulls in '86, but things may have turned out differently in a matchup between that Celtics squad and the Bulls' best.\n\n1986-87 Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBy the time Jordan and the Bulls got to match up against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers in the postseason -- the 1991 NBA Finals -- the \"Showtime\" Lakers were on their last legs. At that point, Magic and the Lakers were coming off a decade straight of deep postseason runs, and while still great, they just weren't the same squad that they once were. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was gone, while Johnson and James Worthy had both declined athletically.\n\nThe Lakers were still good enough to win 58 regular-season games during the 1990-91 campaign and advance all the way to the Finals, but once there they couldn't keep up with the young and hungry Bulls, who won the series in five games. It was Chicago's only Finals series during the decade that didn't stretch to six games. For the Lakers, the loss to the Bulls in 1991 proved to be the end of an era, as it was the last time that they would make the Finals in nearly a decade. It was also Magic's last postseason run, as he retired from the NBA prior to the start of the 1991-92 season.\n\nWhile it was great to get to see Jordan and Johnson go at each other on the highest stage, it would have been so much better -- and likely closer as a series -- if Johnson was still in his prime athletically, and still had his go-to guy in Abdul-Jabbar, as he did in '87. After winning 67 games during the regular season, the Lakers blew through the postseason, losing a total of just three games on their way to a title. Would anyone on Chicago's front line have been able to slow Abdul-Jabbar? As a team they never had to face a dominant center during any of their six Finals matchups, so it certainly would have been a tough test.\n\n2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers\n\nTwo years after Jordan won his sixth and final title with the Bulls, the NBA's next dynasty emerged in the form of the Los Angeles Lakers. Led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers made four Finals appearances and won three titles from 2000 to 2004 (Bryant would go on to lead the Lakers to two more titles in 2009 and 2010 after O'Neal was traded). The tandem of Shaq and Kobe, much like Michael and Scottie, quickly established themselves as one of the most dominant duos in league history in the process.\n\nThey had a better regular-season record the year before (67-15 compared to 56-26), but the 2000-01 Lakers were one of the most dominant playoff teams of all time. They went 16-1 in the postseason on the way to their second straight title, and if it weren't for a gutsy 48-point performance from the league's MVP at the time -- Allen Iverson -- in Game 1 of the 2001 Finals against the 76ers, they would have gone undefeated. Given their dominance, it would have been extremely interesting to see how they would have fared against the Bulls at their best.\n\nJordan and O'Neal have some playoff history, as Shaq's Magic defeated Jordan and the Bulls in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1995 before Chicago bounced back to sweep Orlando in the 1996 conference finals. Still, O'Neal didn't fully hit his prime as a player until he signed in Los Angeles, where he blossomed into arguably the most dominant big man the league has ever seen. Watching the most dominant scorer and perimeter player go against the best big man in the game while both in their primes would have been a sight to see.\n\nThen there's the Kobe Bryant angle. Bryant completely modeled his game after Jordan, and as a result, he was the closest clone to Jordan that we've ever seen -- and likely ever will. Bryant's game mirrored Jordan's, and though Bryant wasn't quite as great as M.J., he was damn close. Both being lockdown perimeter defenders, they assuredly would have guarded each other in this matchup, with both trying their hardest to prevent the other from having a big night on the offensive end. Watching those two fierce competitors go head-to-head for a title would have been fascinating.\n\nNo matter who came out on top of this hypothetical bout between the Bulls and Lakers, Phil Jackson would have walked away with a W either way as he was the head coach of both teams. Talk about a resume.\n\n2012-13 Miami Heat\n\nLike Jordan and Pippen, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were one of the best duos of all time, even though they only played together for four years (four and a half if you count Wade's forgettable stint with the Cavaliers during the 2017-18 season). During their time together in Miami, James and Wade made four straight Finals appearances and won two titles. They were at their best during the 2012-13 season when they won a franchise-record 66 regular-season games (including 27 straight at one point) and went on to best the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.\n\nConsidering the fact that many consider Jordan and James to be the two best players in league history, a postseason matchup between them would have been one for the ages. The two all-time greats would have ended up matched up on each other for stretches, as James often served as the de facto ball-handler for the Heat. While James would've had the size advantage, Jordan regularly took it to players as big, or even bigger, than James so he certainly wouldn't have been intimidated. Both were elite defenders in their prime, so the matchup likely would have came down to which one could do a better job of slowing the other.\n\nPlus, Pippen and Wade are arguably the two best No. 2s of all time, and both would have found a multitude of ways to impact the series. The same can be said for Dennis Rodman and Chris Bosh, as Rodman certainly would have tried his best to irritate Bosh. Both teams had solid veteran role players surrounding their stars, and overall it likely would have been a pretty even series. It's too bad we'll never get to see it play out, because the outcome could've gone a long way toward settling the incessant debates regarding who the better player is between Jordan and James.\n\n2016-17 Golden State Warriors\n\nWhen ESPN recently re-ranked the best teams of all time, the 2016-17 Warriors were the only team to rank ahead of the 1995-96 Bulls. Their explanation:\n\nAfter failing to translate an NBA-record 73 wins into a title the previous season, the Warriors slacked -- relatively -- after adding Kevin Durant to the core of the 2015 champions, winning only 67 games. Come playoff time, Golden State lived up to its potential, coming within a game of completing the first unbeaten postseason in NBA history. The Warriors settled for 16-1, and their adjusted playoff differential ranks second all time behind the 2001 Lakers.\n\nWhile Golden State won more games (73) the previous season -- breaking the Bulls' record 72-win season -- the '16-17 Warriors were virtually the same team as the year before. The difference? They added a future Hall of Famer still in his prime in Kevin Durant. That iteration of the Warriors had one of the most explosive offensives of all time, and they were also dominant defensively.\n\nThough there was no such thing as stopping Michael Jordan, the Warriors had several capable defenders -- Thompson, Iguodala, Durant -- that they could have shuffled onto Jordan to potentially slow him down. Thus, Steph Curry likely wouldn't have spent much time, if any, guarding Jordan, as M.J. would have proved to be too big and strong for Curry to handle.\n\nOn the flip side, if anyone had a chance of stifling the Splash Brothers, it would have been the combination of Jordan and Pippen. Jordan almost certainly would have spent a substantial amount of time dogging Curry, and making sure that the two-time MVP didn't get any easy looks. Ron Harper probably would have drawn Thompson for extended stretches, while Pippen likely would have been tasked with slowing Durant. All of these matchups would have been fascinating to see. Plus the battle of the boards between Rodman and Draymond Green, and the trash-talking between the two, would have been epic.\n\nOur Latest NBA Stories\n\nLuka, LeBron, Redick react to Dončić's Dallas return\n\nSam Quinn\n                                                                • 4 min read\n\nWarriors lose stunner to Spurs, shake up West standings\n\nSam Quinn\n                                                                • 3 min read\n\nLuka's 45-point return to Dallas is salt in Mavs' wound\n\nBrad Botkin\n                                                                • 3 min read\n\nDončić moved to tears by tribute video in Dallas return\n\nSam Quinn\n                                                                • 4 min read\n\nNuggets vs. Kings odds, picks, simulations, best bets\n\nJimmie Kaylor\n                                                                • 3 min read\n\nKidd: Luka trade comparison to Babe Ruth 'kinda cool'\n\nZachary Pereles\n                                                                • 2 min read\n\nShare Video\n\nBest Jordan matchups we never got to see\n\nLuka scores 45, pours salt in Mavs' wound\n\nTop moments from Luka's tearful return\n\nNBA MVP Rankings: Why SGA is a lock\n\nFiring epidemic has gotten out of hand\n\nHow the Nuggets are wasting Jokić's prime\n\nWarriors lose stunner to Spurs, shake up West\n\nLuka, LeBron, Redick react to Dončić's Dallas return\n\nKidd: Luka trade comparison to Babe Ruth 'kinda cool'\n\nNBA rescinds Luka Dončić's controversial tech vs. OKC\n\n© 2004-2025 CBS Interactive.
