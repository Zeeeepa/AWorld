        "raw_content": "How the Dennis Rodman trade helped the Chicago Bulls\n\nStephen Beslic | Apr 9, 2023\n\nBefore the start of the 1995-96 season, the Chicago Bulls traded backup center Will Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for Dennis Rodman, who was then a two-time NBA champion, four-time NBA rebounding champion, and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAt the time of the trade, Rodman was considered highly talented, but also extremely controversial. Rodman clashed with coaches, teammates, and the media during his time in San Antonio, so the Spurs were eager to move on from him despite his impressive rebounding abilities.\n\nImproving frontcourt defense\n\nThe Bulls saw an opportunity to add an excellent defender and rebounder to their already talented roster. Rodmanâs presence helped the Bulls improve their frontcourt defense which gave them a better chance of winning another NBA championship.\n\nBulls general manager Jerry Krause and head coach Phil Jackson talked a lot with Rodman before trading for him. According to Jackson, Krause left the decision to acquire Rodman up to him. Jordan and Pippen approved the move.\n\nâPhil and I talked very carefully about this,â Krause said. âWe did an awful lot of homework and found out a lot of things. We were both satisfied.â\n\nThe Rodman effect\n\nThe Bulls were hurting on the boards since losing Horace Grant to free agency in 1994, and Jordanâs return forced Toni Kukoc to play out of position at power forward.\n\nThe 1995-96 campaign was the final year of Rodmanâs contract, and he exceeded expectations, averaging 5.5 points, 2.5 assists and a league-best 14.9 rebounds in 32.6 minutes over 64 games in the regular season while behaving well. The Bulls decided to extend his contract for two more years.\n\nâThe one promise we made to Dennis, was, we said at the beginning, when we first talked, we said at the end of the year we will sit down and weâll talk about the future, and I think thatâs what we are gonna do, we are going to sit down at the end of the year,â Krause told Jim Gray from NBC Sports before the Bulls played the Magic in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nâDennis has been outstanding, he hasnât missed a practice, he hasnât been late, heâs done the things weâve asked him to do on the basketball court, heâs a tremendous practice player, Dennis has been very good for this team and I believe that heâs a good person.â\n\nRodman averaged 5.2 points, 15.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 34.6 minutes over 199 regular season games with the Bulls from 1996 to 1998. He won three rebounding titles and even averaged a career-high 3.1 assists in 1997.\n\nThe five-time NBA champion averaged 5.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 32.4 minutes over 58 playoff games with the Bulls.\n\nIn the end, the trade worked out well for the Bulls and the Spurs. Rodman thrived in Chicago, playing a crucial role in helping the Bulls win three NBA championships in a row from 1996 to 1998.\n\nPerdue, on the other hand, played a solid role for the Spurs as a backup center, and they went on to win their first NBA championship in 1999.\n\nStephen Beslic is a writer on Sports Illustrated's FanNation Network.
