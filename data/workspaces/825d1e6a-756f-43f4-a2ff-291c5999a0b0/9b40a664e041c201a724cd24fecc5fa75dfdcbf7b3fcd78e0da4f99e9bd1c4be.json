          "raw_content": "What's LeBron James' record in the NBA Finals? Comparing superstar forward's finals record to Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James has had a remarkable career so far, showing great longevity as he enters his 20th season in the NBA. James made his first playoff appearance during the 2005-06 season as a Cavalier.\n\nBack then, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished the regular season with a respectable 61% winning record. However, James’ playoff run was cut short, losing 4-3 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nJames came out hungry the following season, getting his revenge on the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He averaged 25.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over six games, including a 48-point performance in Game 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers won the series in six games but were swept by the fundamentalists – the San Antonio Spurs – in the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James’ four subsequent NBA Finals appearances came during his stint with the Miami Heat. Teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, James was in the NBA Finals again. However, the Dallas Mavericks came out on top in the 2011 Finals.\n\nJames was a dominant force in the following two seasons, leading his team in scoring, rebounds, and assists – in both the finals. The Miami Heat were crowned champions in 2012 & 2013, with James winning the Finals MVP in both editions.\n\nJames’ return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 sparked a new NBA Finals rivalry between them and the Golden State Warriors. They matched up in the NBA finals for four consecutive years, with LeBron James being crowned champion only once. After being swept by the Warriors in the 2018 NBA Finals, James took his services to the LA Lakers.\n\nLeBron's stint with the LA Lakers has been turbulent to say the least, given he’s made the playoffs in only two of his four seasons. Still, James did guide the Lakers to the championship in 2020.\n\nLeBron James’ NBA Finals record vs Michael Jordan’s\n\nCollectively, James has been in 10 NBA Finals, coming out victorious in four. He won the Finals MVP in all those editions, matching up as closely with his idol, Michael Jordan, as he could. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, has reached the NBA Finals just six times in his 15 seasons.\n\nHowever, Michael Jordan’s record in the NBA Finals is what sets him apart. Like James, Jordan was the top-performer in all his championship runs – earning the Finals MVP award in all six editions.\n\nBut Jordan was able to win the title in all six appearances – completing two three-peats. James’ winning percentage (40%) in the NBA Finals, taking nothing away from his efforts, will always be brought up in any comparison with Jordan.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Comparing Career Scoring Totals\n\nMitch Goldich | Mar 7, 2019\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points Wednesday in the Lakers' 115-99 loss to the Nuggets. It would likely go down as a forgettable result in a season heâd like to forget, save for one major news item: He passed Michael Jordan on the NBAâs all-time career scoring list.\n\nAs his 16th season winds down, LeBron has now racked up 32,311 points, even more than the 32,292 points MJ tallied in his 15 regular seasons. LeBron is now fourth all-time in scoring, trailing just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant.\n\nSo today is the day. I will personally make the case that determines which of these two players is better and we will all agree forever. OK, probably not. There are other places on the internet to read those kinds of takes today. Instead Iâll just present some graphs and charts to compare the scoring outputs from these two all-time greats.\n\n1. Total points by age\n\nHere are their career points scored, broken down by age. In this case age means their n-age season, basically the year they were n years old on February 1, which is the way Basketball-Reference displays ages.\n\nHere you can see the advantage LeBron gained by jumping to the league straight out of high school, as he banked 3,700 points at the same ages that had Jordan wearing Carolina blue.\n\nThen you can see MJ gaining on LeBron until his baseball years (outside of his second season, when he only played 18 games in 1985-86).\n\nNow at 34, LeBron is the same age Jordan was when he finished his Bulls career with a second three-peat.\n\n2. Total points by season\n\nThis graph is similar to the one above, but now we go by season instead of age. This takes out the advantage LeBron gets from starting younger and playing all the way through. Jordanâs trajectory is no longer stunted by taking the 1993-94 season off, though you can still see the 1995 year when he played just 17 games in his return from baseball.\n\nBy this measure, Jordan was ahead of LeBron when he hung them up after his Wizards stint.\n\n3. Points per game by age4. Points per game by season\n\nThese two graphs are the same as the first two, but instead of using cumulative career points, weâll use scoring average per game during those seasons.\n\nAgain, when Jordan isnât dinged for the seasons he missed, you can see that his scoring average per season was consistently higher for most of his career.\n\nThatâs true either way you break it down, although his scoring averages as a 38- and 39-year-old in Washington, his 14th and 15th seasons, show a noticeable dip.\n\n5. Breaking down field goals, free throws and three-pointers\n\nThese pie charts basically answer the question: How did they get their points? It shows the career breakdowns for both players, and the percentage of points that came from free throws, two-point field goals and three-pointers.\n\nTheir free throw output is very close; Jordan made 7,327 and LeBron has made 7,101.\n\nThe key difference is three-point shooting. James has made 1,714 three pointers, while Jordan made just 581. Of course thatâs a result of them being products of their era. Jordan was a career 32.7% three-point shooter, while James has made a slightly better 34.4%. If Jordan played today, three-point shooting would likely be a bigger emphasis of his gameâmore attempts and he probably would have gotten even better at it.\n\n6. Breaking down points by team\n\nOne of the key differences between their careers is that Jordan spent almost all of his with the Bulls, until his late run with the Wizards. Jordanâs most famous employer swap was from the Bulls to the Birmingham Barons and back, whereas LeBron left Cleveland for Miami, came back and then again moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThis graph simply shows how many points they scored in each of their NBA uniforms.\n\n7. Breaking down points by career stop\n\nIf youâd like to take the previous graph and break it down further, this time weâll consider each of LeBronâs stops in Cleveland separately. And while weâre at it, we can carve out Jordanâs pre-baseball and post-baseball eras in Chicago.\n\nHereâs their total output during each of the various chapters in their careers.\n\n8. Scoring leader race by season\n\nIn addition to scoring more per game and more per season relative to LeBron, one thing that stands out about Jordanâs career is the way that he dominated his peers in the scoring race.\n\nJordan led the NBA in total points 11 times, including every season from 1986-87 through 1997-98 when he wasnât playing baseball.\n\nLeBron finished second in total points in eight straight seasons from 2004-05 through 2011-12, finishing behind Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (3x), Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant (3x). He didnât lead the league in total points until last season, his first time playing 82 games.\n\nThis graph shows where they finished in the league scoring (total points, not per game), based on the number of times finishing in each spot.Â  Jordan led the league 11 times, every season of his career except the two shortened Bulls seasons and the two Wizards seasons. LeBron only has that one season leading the league, but he was consistently in the Top 5. In fact, his first season in L.A. is his only time out of the Top 10, largely because of how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nIf we used points per game to show where they stood among league leaders, the graph would look very similar. Jordanâs career scoring mark of 30.12 points per game is the all-time record, and MJ won the per game scoring title 10 times. LeBron's mark of 27.15 is fourth all-time, behind Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. (For now at least. It takes three decimal places to separate James and Durant, and LeBron actually leapfrogged KD on Wednesday.)\n\nBut again, none of this is to say that Jordan was better than LeBron. Or vice versa. They each have different careers, different skills and different stories. It would be just as simplistic to boil their entire careers down to total points as it is to reduce their careers down to championship rings. They both deserve to be appreciated for what theyâve done, and on a day thatâs natural to compare their scoring output itâs fun to compare their careers in a few different ways.\n\nMitch Goldich is a senior editor for Sports Illustrated, mostly focused on the NFL.

The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.

          "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

          "raw_content": "LeBron James Crushes Michael Jordan In Key Stats\n\nThe eternal debate over basketball’s greatest of all time frequently narrows down to two luminaries: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Jordan, with his six championship rings, epitomized dominance in the ’90s, setting a virtually unparalleled standard.\n\nMeanwhile, LeBron’s unique blend of athleticism and versatility redefines what prolonged excellence looks like in the NBA.  Both icons have built near-impenetrable legacies.\n\nSo, if we delve into the numbers—championships, MVPs, and more—who truly claims the record books?\n\nNBA Championships\n\nLeBron’s quartet of championships highlights his exceptional ability to adapt and lead, having clinched titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers.  Yet, the lingering narrative of his 4-6 NBA Finals record points to the struggles he faced in securing wins when the stakes were at their highest.\n\nOn the flip side, Jordan’s six-for-six in Finals appearances with the Bulls remains the gold standard.  His undefeated Finals record stands as a monument to his peerless capacity to deliver during basketball’s most crucial moments.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-1\n\nFinals MVPs\n\nHere, LeBron’s talent for taking center stage during the NBA’s grandest series shines through, with noteworthy performances like his near triple-double series in 2016. Yet, for Jordan, every championship came paired with a Finals MVP—showcasing time and again his ability to outshine all competitors on the brightest stage.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-2\n\nRegular Season MVPs\n\nLeBron’s run of MVPs underscores his all-around impact and consistent brilliance, although he frequently found himself snubbed perhaps due to voter fatigue. For Jordan, five MVP accolades marked his reign as the unequivocal king of two Chicago Bulls dynasties, reinforcing his long-held status as the best in the league.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-3\n\nScoring Titles\n\nWhile LeBron excels as a scorer, his focus on all-around play resulted in just one scoring title. Though, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer didn’t require him to lead the league every year. Jordan, however, amassed ten scoring titles, with seven consecutive at his zenith, cementing his status as an unparalleled offensive juggernaut.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-4\n\nAssist Titles\n\nShowcasing his playmaking prowess, LeBron led the league in assists in 2020, illustrating his capability to quarterback an entire offense. Jordan’s role rarely required him to serve as the principal facilitator, although he remained adept in creating plays when necessary.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 1-4\n\nAll-NBA Selections\n\nLeBron’s 20 selections not only reflect his rarefied skill but also underscore his longevity. Remaining one of the top players over two decades is an unprecedented accomplishment. Meanwhile, Jordan’s 11 honors, achieved in a shorter span, were packed with exceptional dominance, each season testimony to his status as the league’s premier player.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 2-4\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\nLeBron’s 21 All-Star appearances further emphasize his enduring relevance and adaptability amidst evolving league dynamics. Jordan’s 14 All-Star nods, though fewer, affirm his perennial impact, with court performances that turned the exhibition into prime-time must-watch events.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 3-4\n\nAll-Star Game MVPs\n\nIn the spotlight of All-Star weekend, both icons displayed their exceptional skills, each capturing three MVP titles. LeBron dazzled with flair and dominance while remaining a crowd-pleaser. Jordan approached these games with a competitive spirit, famously engaging in a memorable clash with Kobe Bryant in 1998.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-5\n\nAll-Defensive Team Selections\n\nWhile LeBron has been formidable defensively during stretches, especially in Miami, his collective accolades don’t rival his offensive feats. Jordan’s defense was relentless, earning him nine First Team selections and reinforcing his all-around excellence.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-6\n\nDefensive Player of the Year Awards\n\nDefensive dominance is epitomized by Jordan’s 1988 DPOY award, a year in which he also led the league in scoring. It remains one of the most remarkable dual achievements in NBA history.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-7\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nBoth athletes burst onto the scene, immediately transforming their teams. LeBron’s debut season hinted at greatness as he elevated a lackluster Cavaliers squad, while Jordan’s 28.2 points per game as a rookie previewed the prolific scorer he would become.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 5-8\n\nTotal Win Shares\n\nIn terms of win shares, LeBron’s substantial total illustrates his long-term influence on team success, with his versatile skill set contributing to victory over a prolonged career. Jordan, while behind in total count, boasted immense per-season impact amplified by his legendary playoff performances.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-8\n\nCareer Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\n\nLeBron’s exceptional PER underscores his comprehensive performance levels across every statistical measure. Yet Jordan’s slight edge in this metric highlights his superior efficiency during fewer seasons, a testament to his unparalleled dominance.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-9\n\nNBA Cup Titles\n\nLeBron etched his name once more into the history books by securing the first-ever NBA Cup, adding another facet to his illustrious career.\n\nIn the expansive realm of basketball debate, the ledger leans towards Jordan. However, this ongoing discourse reminds us how each titan has left an indelible mark on the game, and, perhaps, greatness can indeed wear different forms.\n\nLatest Miami Heat News & Rumors To Your Inbox\n\nStart your day with latest Miami Heat news and rumors in your inbox.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James Vs Michael Jordan: Who Was the Better Defender Between the Two GOAT Candidates?\n\nShubham Singh|PublishedJan 30, 2024\n\nCredits- USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA community is obsessed with the GOAT debate. Usually, the choice boils down to the two NBA legends, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Since most fans are generally interested in the two players’ contributions on the offensive end, their extraordinary defensive contributions can be often overlooked. Therefore, one interesting way of looking into the GOAT debate can be by examining Jordan and LeBron’s defensive numbers and accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo simplify the arguments, one can deploy the usage of defensive win shares and defensive rating as the predominant stats. Defensive win shares is an advanced stat that requires complex calculations. This thorough indicator takes into account the minutes played by the player and the team, league points per possession, defensive rating, and a bunch of other stats that provide a condensed fraction. Simply speaking, the higher a player’s defensive win shares, the more contributions a player has made defensively to the team.\n\nConversely, when it comes to defensive rating, a lower number is desirable. The defensive rating is measured by how many points a player allows per 100 possessions. Let us take a look at how LeBron James and Michael Jordan do in these two categories and present an overview of their defensive accolades.\n\nLeBron James\n\nJames has always been a prime-time defender. His defense peaked during his late Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat days. He made the first All-NBA Defensive Teams from 2009 to 2013. In fact, in 2008-09, the Cavs Forward finished second to 3x DPOY Dwight Howard in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. While in the 2012-13 season, another Center Marc Gasol nabbed the award from the Heat’s Two-Way phenom as he finished with 18 votes compared to Gasol’s 31. In 2014, LeBron made his last All-NBA defensive team when he was selected to the second team.\n\nIn terms of All-Time Defensive Win Shares, James is 11th on the list with 79.88 DWS. His defensive rating is placed at an impressive 104.4, just above his former Lakers teammate Dwight Howard. For his career, the four-time NBA Champion has captured around 1.5 steals per game. His best season was his sophomore season when he clinched 2.2 steals per game.\n\nAs a premier shot-blocker, James has notched 0.7 blocks per game, going over 1 block a game four times. His chase-down blocks are revered across generations. His block against Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals that denied the Warriors a lead remains one of the most historic ones ever.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan is one of the best perimeter defenders to play the game. MJ made 9X All-NBA Defensive Teams and even won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1988. In terms of Defensive Win Shares, Jordan is 21st All-Time with 64.13. The Guard had a defensive rating of 102.7. He was the league’s steals leader thrice in his career.\n\nMJ finished his career, notching an impressive 2.3 steals per game and is fourth all-time in the steals-per-game department. The six-time NBA Champion was also an impressive shot-blocker, finishing with 0.8 blocks a game. He blocked more than a shot per game four times in his career.\n\nOne of the most iconic blocks for MJ came when he was with the Wizards. The Shooting Guard with massive hands had plucked the ball away from Bulls’ Ron Mercer while he was attempting a layup. It was as if the veteran guard snatched a rebound away from a player attempting the shot.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese comparisons again can’t make an objective argument for which player is a better defender. Even though some might give Jordan the edge, they have different profiles. Jordan was more of an on-ball defender but was equally adept at helping from the weak side. Meanwhile, James is one of the best help defenders while equally threatening in one-on-one situations. Both players have been among the best competitors so it is natural that their defense was top-notch. At any rate, this defensive comparison won’t move the needle in the GOAT debate. The more people talk about it, the muddier the water gets.\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level. It quite literally does not get better than that.\nNBA POSITIONAL RANKINGS: PG | SG | SF | PF | C\nLeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Regular season stats\nJames' longevity gives him the edge in total statistics but Jordan holds the edge in scoring average.

How did each player succeed and what did their heroics mean for the series and the NBA playoffs as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the top conference finals performances, highlighted by four from James and two from Jimmy Butler, who will look to add to his total in the games to come.\n-- Kevin Pelton\n\n1. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 42.5\n\nLeBron James was at the height of his powers in the legendary 2016 NBA Finals. Bob Donnan/Pool Photo via AP\n2016 Finals: Game 6 vs. Golden State Warriors\nBy now you've seen the viral clip of James in the Cavs' locker room after Game 6 of the 2016 Finals, putting the 15th piece of the team's 16-piece Larry O'Brien Trophy championship puzzle in place while telling his team the Warriors are \"f---ed up ... mentally and physically.\" He dealt a fair portion of that damage with 41 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Cleveland jumped out to a 31-11 lead after the first quarter and won by 15 points to set up a Game 7 for the ages.\n-- Dave McMenamin\n2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 42.0\n2021 Finals: Game 6 vs. Phoenix Suns\nWith the Bucks one win away from winning their first NBA title in 50 years, all it took was Antetokounmpo having one of the greatest games in Finals history to end their drought.\nAntetokounmpo finished with 50 points on 16-for-25 shooting from the field to go along with 14 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 blocks was one thing. But for him to also go 17-for-19 from the free throw line, after all of the chatter about his foul shooting during the postseason, was the definition of rising to meet the moment.\nAnd, as a result, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks were able to celebrate a championship on their home floor in Milwaukee.\n-- Tim Bontemps\n3. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 42.0\n2020 Finals: Game 3 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\nButler carried the Heat throughout their time in the 2020 Orlando, Florida, Bubble, but never more so than in Game 3 of the Finals against James and the Lakers. Butler scored 40 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a win that not only kept the Heat in the series, but further cemented his status as one of the game's premiere playoff players. Butler played 45 minutes, leaving everything he had on the floor while making big play after big play all night.\n-- Nick Friedell\n4. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 41.3\n\nJimmy Butler left it all on the court in the 2020 Finals. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\nWith his team's season hanging in the balance in the bubble, Butler delivered another all-time performance to the tune of 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a Game 5 victory over the Lakers. Butler knew he had to set a tone for the rest of his teammates and that's exactly what he did, following up his Game 3 showcase with another game that will be remembered within the Heat organization for years. Aside from Butler's ability to make big plays all over the floor, the picture of an exhausted Butler from this game remains one of the most memed in history.\n-- Friedell\n5. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 41.3\n2018 Finals: Game 1 vs. Golden State Warriors\nIn the greatest game of James' individual postseason run, the star forward became just the fifth player in league history to top 50 points in an NBA Finals game, joining Elgin Baylor (61), Michael Jordan (55), Rick Barry (55) and Jerry West (53) with 51 points. He also had 8 rebounds and 8 assists, all against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. The masterful performance still wasn't enough to get a win, as the Warriors prevailed in overtime with two crucial sequences going against the Cavs. First, James was called for a blocking foul on Kevin Durant with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two. Had it been a charge, maybe things would have been different. And second, in one of the most memed moments of James' career, JR Smith dribbled out the clock when George Hill missed a free throw with four seconds left with the score tied, rather than go for the go-ahead bucket near the hoop, causing James to splay his arms toward his teammate in exasperation.\n-- McMenamin\n6. Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs | Game score: 40.8\n2003 Finals: Game 6 vs. New Jersey Nets\nDuncan set the tone for the Spurs' Finals defeat of the Nets with an all-time box-score stuffing performance in the series opener: 32 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, 7 blocks and 3 steals. It was the most blocks and steals ever recorded in a 30-20 Finals outing and the third-most assists. Duncan was almost as dominant in the closeout Game 6, putting up a 21-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist, 8-block line to clinch his second Finals MVP.\n-- Tim MacMahon\n7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 39.8\n2018 Finals: Game 3 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers\nAny time the Warriors needed a big play in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers, Durant delivered. He had 43 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists, but it was a clutch 3-pointer over two Cavs defenders with 52 seconds left that sealed both the game and his place in Finals history. An all-time dagger from an all-time player. Durant would go on to win his second straight Finals MVP and lead the Warriors to their second consecutive title.\n-- Friedell\n8. Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.6\n1980 Finals: Game 6 vs. Philadelphia 76ers\nTop stories of the week from \nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Best men's hoops games on every day »\n• Premier League: 25 best/worst at skills »\n• NBA: 7 lottery teams and their futures »\nMore ESPN+ content »\nJohnson, who was a year removed from leading Michigan State to the NCAA title, stepped into the starting center role for the Finals closeout game with legendary big man Kareem Abdul-Jabbar staying in Los Angeles to nurse a badly sprained ankle. \"Never fear, Magic is here!\" Johnson told his teammates as they boarded the flight to Philadelphia. Johnson delivered the best Finals performance ever by a rookie, scoring 42 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and dishing out 7 assists to lead the Lakers to the first of their five championships in the Showtime era.\n-- MacMahon\n9. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 39.2\n2016 Finals: Game 5 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\"What did you say Klay [Thompson] said?\" James asked a reporter prior to Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals. \"Klay said, 'I guess he just got his feelings hurt,'\" the reporter replied, detailing Thompson's response to James' run-in with Draymond Green in Game 4. Then James burst out an indulgent chuckle. It was the start of the most significant postseason stretch of his career, winning Games 5 through 7 to help the Cavaliers become the first team in Finals history to climb out of a 3-1 deficit and win. James was brilliant in Game 5, putting up 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks as he and Kyrie Irving became the first pair of teammates to ever drop 40-plus in the same Finals game. The comeback was on.\n-- McMenamin\n10. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.1\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Miami Heat\nMuch like the Smith game in the 2018 Finals, James' brilliance in Game 5 of the 2020 Finals sometimes gets forgotten, because of the attention paid to Danny Green's potential game-winning 3-pointer from the top of the key missing with under 10 seconds remaining. But the fact that James nearly closed out the bubble by making 15 out of 21 shots -- including 6-of-9 3s -- to score 40 points with 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals while wearing the \"Black Mamba\" uniform that held so much significance to the Lakers' franchise that season in remembering Kobe Bryant makes it one of the finest playoff games of James' or any other player's career.\n-- McMenamin\n11. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls | Game score: 38.9\n\nEven by his standards, Michael Jordan was unstoppable in Game 4 of the '93 Finals. Manny Millan /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n1993 Finals: Game 4 vs. Phoenix Suns\nJordan scored nearly half of the Bulls' points with a 55-point outburst in Game 4 of the 1993 Finals. It was one of the highest scoring performances in Finals history and put the Bulls on the verge of their first three-peat.\nChicago won the first two games of the series on the road before dropping Game 3 after returning home, but Jordan would not allow the Suns back into the series. Phoenix had no answer in stopping him from getting to the rim and Jordan shot 56.8% from the field with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. Jordan's 55 points are tied for the second-most in Finals history, trailing only a 61-point game by Baylor in 1962.\n-- Jamal Collier\n12. Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 37.9\n2000 Finals: Game 1 vs. Indiana Pacers\nShaq's 2000 series against Indiana was one of the most dominant Finals ever, as he averaged 38.0 PPG to rank third in Finals history behind Jordan in 1993 (41.0) and Baylor in 1962 (40.6). Fresh off a Game 7 comeback to beat the Portland Trail Blazers, O'Neal served the Pacers notice in the series opener at the then-Staples Center, putting up 41 points on 21-of-31 shooting and 19 rebounds as the Lakers pulled away late. The 21 field goals were one shy of Baylor's 1962 Finals record, which came on 15 more shot attempts.\n-- Pelton\n13. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 37.4\n2021 Finals: Game 3 vs. Phoenix Suns\nWhen the Bucks returned home from Phoenix down 2-0 in the Finals, it looked like their storybook season would wind up being anything but.\nThat's where Antetokounmpo came in. With a loss all but certain to end Milwaukee's season, Antetokounmpo made sure that would not happen, going for 41 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists in just under 38 minutes, while also going -- in a precursor to his truly legendary performance in Game 6 -- 13-for-17 from the foul line. It wound up being the first of four straight wins for the Bucks in the series, as Milwaukee would go on to win its first title since 1971.\n-- Bontemps\n14. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 37.2\n\nStephen Curry's heroics couldn't lead the Warriors to a victory in Game 3 of the 2019 NBA Finals. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images\n2019 Finals: Game 3 vs. Toronto Raptors\nThe barrage of shots from all over the floor started early in a Game 3 loss to the Raptors as Curry carried an offense playing without star forward Durant, who was out because of an Achilles injury. While he couldn't carry the Warriors to a victory, Curry hit six 3-pointers and scored 47 points, giving Warriors fans one last show in Oracle Arena before the team moved to Chase Center after the season. While Curry's performance was a highlight for the Warriors, this series will always be remembered by Durant's Achilles tear in Game 5 and Klay Thompson's ACL tear in Game 6.\n-- Friedell\n15. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns | Game score: 37.0\n1993 Finals: Game 2 vs. Chicago Bulls\nAfter a subpar Game 1, where he posted 21 points on 9-of-25 shooting as the Bulls won the opener in Phoenix, Barkley bounced back with his best game of the 1993 Finals: 42 points on 16-of-26 shooting, plus 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Only one problem: Jordan also scored 42 points, coming within an assist of a triple-double. While Barkley got the edge in game score by virtue of his efficiency, Jordan's Chicago team earned the 111-108 win, taking a 2-0 lead in a series they would go on to win in six games.\n-- Pelton\nThe best of the rest\n16. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls, 1992 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 36.9\n17. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks, 2021 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 36.7\n18. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers, 2017 Finals Game 5 | Game score: 36.2\n19. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors, 2016 Finals Game 7 | Game score: 35.9\n20.

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nRanking the Greatest NBA Finals Performances in Losing Efforts Since 2000\n\nAs much as we hope to see greatness rewarded, that simply does not always happen in the NBA Finals.\n\nIn recent memory, a prime example is LeBron James during the 2015 NBA Finals. He paced all scorers in five of the six games, but his injury-plagued Cleveland Cavaliers could not keep up with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nFive other instances stand out since the 2000 NBA Finals.\n\nHistorically, the losing team's top player is not recognized for his efforts. Only once—Jerry West in 1969—has an individual from the runner-up still earned the MVP honor. But the following group has a few players who demanded that level of respect in the last 20-plus years.\n\nThe list is subjective but focuses on individual production and considers both series length and context.\n\nIn the moment, perhaps you didn't have a lot of sympathy for Stephen Curry. After all, the Golden State Warriors had made the NBA Finals for a fifth consecutive season and previously won three titles.\n\nBut as a star-studded roster crumbled around him, Curry did as much as possible to keep the Dubs in contention.\n\nGolden State lost Kevin Durant to an Achilles injury in Game 1 and Klay Thompson to a torn left ACL in Game 5.\n\nCurry averaged 30.5 points, 6.0 assists and 5.2 rebounds in the series. Along with maxing out at 47 points—then the highest total of his playoff career—in Game 3, he drilled a clutch late-game triple to help the Warriors win Game 4.\n\nHowever, the Kawhi Leonard-led Toronto Raptors dispatched the banged-up Warriors in six games.\n\nThe next two players share a common trait: They excelled in a Finals loss to LeBron-led opposition.\n\nDurant tallied 25-plus points in all five clashes with the Heat, opening the series by scoring 36 points in an OKC victory. Unfortunately for the Thunder, that would be their lone win of the series.\n\nNevertheless, the 23-year-old Durant had a memorable five-game run. He averaged 30.6 points with a 54.8 percent shooting mark, hitting 39.4 percent of his 6.6 long-range attempts per game.\n\nLeBron secured MVP honors and his first-ever championship, but KD left a strong impression in his Finals debut.\n\nSince joining the Miami Heat in 2020, Jimmy Butler has unleashed an incredible alter ego: Playoff Jimmy.\n\nThe legend began in the bubble, peaking opposite the Los Angeles Lakers during the NBA Finals. Butler had 22-plus points in the first five contests, including a 40-point explosion with a triple-double in Game 3.\n\nAs if that's not enough, the Heat won Game 5 thanks to his 35-point triple-double—with a handful of steals, too.\n\nButler wrapped up the series with 26.2 points per game on 55.2 percent shooting, adding 9.8 assists and 8.2 rebounds. Miami bowed out to LeBron and the Lakers in six games, though.\n\nFrom a narrative perspective, it's a shame that one of Allen Iverson's most iconic highlights preceded a series loss.\n\nBut this moment has endured for decades.\n\nThe opening game of the 2001 Finals between the Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers went to overtime. Iverson sealed the Philly victory with a step-back jumper and disrespectful—in the best way—step over Tyronn Lue.\n\nIverson, who scored 48 points, also contributed six assists and five steals on that memorable night.\n\nSimilar to Durant, the disappointing reality is AI and the Sixers could not manage another win. Nevertheless, he poured in 35.6 points and 3.8 assists per game.\n\nDurant and Butler found themselves on the wrong end of a series against The King. LeBron, however, is not immune to a stellar individual series not being enough for a ring.\n\nIn 2017, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Warriors squared off in a third straight NBA Finals. But the Warriors added Kevin Durant in the prior offseason and cruised to a championship. They jumped out to a 3-0 series lead and sealed the title in a relatively comfortable Game 5.\n\nJames made history anyway.\n\nDespite the runner-up finish, he became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals. LeBron recorded 33.6 points, 12.0 rebound and 10.0 assists per game, shooting 55.6 percent from the floor.\n\nMost remarkably, it's hardly even a discussion this performance in 2017 is behind his showing in 2015.\n\nYou could've given him the MVP in 2015.\n\nSure, the Warriors took the series. LeBron absolutely was the best player, though. He scored a game-high total in five of the six outings—and ended two assists shy of a triple-double in the one contest he did not.\n\nCleveland only had Kyrie Irving for a game, and Kevin Love didn't play a minute. James responded to their absences in tremendous fashion, netting 39-plus points in Games 1-3. He tallied a 40-point triple-double in Game 5 and racked up 32 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists in the series-ending Game 6 loss.\n\nJames averaged a hugely impressive 35.8 points with 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game.\n\nThe next season, he'd lead the Cavaliers to a long-awaited ring.\n\n"

In a time where just one division of athletic programs is a “$6 billion enterprise,” (Desrochers 2013) it’s no wonder that a great amount of money is spent every year in an attempt to increase performance. Athletic departments spend far more – three to six times as much – on athletes than the institutions do to educate average students, with schools in one athletic conference spending an average 12.2 times more ($163,931 compared to $13,390). With all this money being spent, and with at least 92 different sports science journals currently active since 2010 (Journal Ranking 2010) it would be odd to think that there was a simple method of improving sports performance that researchers and collegiate sports programs are overlooking. However, the use of in-game contact as a method to lead to greater success in sports seems to be currently unnoticed.\n\nThe use of touch as a performance indicator for basketball is not an area of sports and movement science that has received much attention. Kraus et al. 2010, which explored this specific connection between touch and performance concluded that “touch is crucial for predicting performance in competitive group settings” and that “teams that went on to enjoy winning records directly following the coded game engaged in more touch (M = 23.79) than teams with losing records after the coded game (M = 16.14)” where the difference in touch was measured in seconds (Kraus et al. 2010). However, most studies, such as Rajan 2009, focus on the effects of nonverbal communication as a whole rather than individual mediums, and though nonverbal communication has been proven to increase confidence and camaraderie between team members, these results are not specific enough to identify the exact causes of increased performance. In our study, we are focusing solely on the effects of touch between members of collegiate basketball teams to see if there is a link the amount of contact and the amount of success teams have.\n\nTouch has the ability to influence and infer many things, from thoughts and perceptions to feelings of trust (Hertenstein 2002, Williams & Bargh 2008). Trust has been cited as an indicator of increased commitment between people and can increase a person’s ability to depend on others when necessary (Wieselquist et al. 1999), which is vital in sports; this is especially true in team sports such as basketball where the ability to depend on other players for constructing plays and throwing passes the game is played and won. Team cohesion positively influences overall performance, especially in team sports where teammates depend on one another for success (Jones & Kijeski 2009). Thus, there is a clear line of logic that connects touch to various avenues of increased success.\n\nThe goal of our research was to see if greater amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team led to greater success of the team in terms of score and number of wins. This was be measured by watching publicly available archived footage of 10 Salem State University home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist, the various forms the in-game contact takes and how often it occurs for both teams. We hypothesized that greater in-game contact between teammates does lead to greater success in basketball.\n\nThe results of this study provide insight into the effects of non-verbal communication and motivation among sports team members. The results could be given to basketball teams or adopted for other sports in order to achieve greater success; the possibilities for the implementation of these results are legion. Teams that go out of their way to make more contact may not only find greater performance on the court but may also feel better about their fellow players and themselves.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nDoes more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nBasketball is a team sport that requires teammates to possess a collaborative skill set. Team cohesion is developed as a result of collaborative efforts between teammates participating in an interactive sport such as basketball. Both verbal and non-verbal communication within an interactive sports team setting inspires confidence and motivation among teammates, further enhancing team cohesion. A mutually supportive, interactive team environment where encouragement is communicated by teammates both verbally and non-verbally through physical touch, promotes cooperation leading to improved performance and team success.\n\nIn a business environment, individuals are often grouped into teams to work on collaborative projects without having first developed or practiced collaborative skills. (Snyder, 2009) The absence of collaborative skills leads the individuals on the team to apply individual approaches to a group experience. This of course would defeat the purpose of being grouped into a team and could potentially lead to conflict within the group as varying individual approaches can either jeopardize the project or exclude other group members. Instructing teams about teamwork provides participants with the tools to perform well within a collaborative setting.\n\nA great deal of effort is often put into preparation and practice to improve individual skills and performance. In addition, individuals require safe environments in which they can practice communication skills prior to performance and evaluation. A safe environment would also include a setting where team membership would remain consistent from practice to performance. If individuals are prepared and practice their team skills, they are more likely to effectively apply their skills in group assignments. In order to practice and model effective collaboration; attention was focused on the purpose of the project, participation and positive collaboration was encouraged, timelines were established, the projects were kept on track and conflicts were negotiated.\n\nIndividuals were given the opportunity to review and revise their collaborative performance through a questionnaire which upon reflection allowed them to be more effective team members. Self reflection is a method of performance evaluation that can provide valuable perspectives. Specific questions were used to help students review and reflect on their performance: After students have a foundational understanding of the collaborative skills, they practice these skills in a collaborative, yet supportive, environment. (Snyder, 2009) The focus on preparation, practice and performance review in teaching teams about teamwork was effective in developing and improving collaborative skills resulting in a positive group experience.\n\nCollaboration is essential to success as it allows a group of individuals to aspire and work towards a common goal. A major part of the collaborative process is communication which can be relayed in many different forms. When all members of a group are collaborating on a project or task and are communicating effectively, efficiency towards goal accomplishment is heightened. Cohesion is displayed within a group setting when the grouped individuals are able to work towards a common goal while communicating effectively. Coactive settings require individuals to take on all the responsibilities and approach tasks without seeking collaboration. Interactive settings require individuals to collaborate with each other to accomplish tasks through communication and this cohesion often leads to success.\n\nThe existence of a relationship between group cohesion and success is explored when both task and social cohesion deal with member-to-member relations within a team environment. (Jones & Kijeski, 2009) Group cohesion applies to social structure within a group, social exchanges between members in the group, role clarity and commitment to the group, common goals between group members, and the relationship of the above to task performance. Interactive team sports such as soccer, basketball, football where members only competed for the good of the team and only received a team score for their efforts exhibited the strongest relationship between team cohesion and team success. Coactive or individual sports such as golf, tennis and gymnastics where athletes can succeed with or without their team, performance is not entirely dependent on team cohesion.\n\nThe purpose of the research was to determine if there was a positive relationship between team cohesion and team success in coactive sports. The research further sought to determine if team cohesion correlates with team performance to a greater degree among teams competing in interactive team sports than among teams competing in coactive team sports. Surveys were used to collect data from a sample of athletes competing on both interactive and coactive sports teams. The sample was collected by administering surveys to the athletes just prior to scheduled practice times, with the prior knowledge and approval of the coaching staff of each team. Task team cohesion and social team cohesion were individually examined to determine if one influences team success more. Team success was defined as the winning percentage of each team in the study and was measured using the publicly available data win/loss records.\n\nThe research study found that team cohesion influences overall success differently between interactive and coactive sports. The findings supported a negative correlation between team cohesion and team success between coactive sports teams and a positive correlation among interactive sports teams. The results are indicative of differences between coactive and interactive sports where coactive athletes are recognized for individual achievements and success. There is less emphasis on recognition of an athlete’s individual achievement and success in interactive sports. Cohesion among athletes may be hindered by inter-team competition in coactive sports as athletes from the same team often compete against each other.\n\nIn coactive settings that require individuals to take on tasks and challenges without the support of others the development of communication and collaborative skills is limited. Coactive individuals are not only faced with the tasks at hand but must also be self confident and motivated to proceed. Interactive settings automatically present a support system where individuals can rely upon each other to work together towards task accomplishment. Individuals grouped together in an interactive situation provide encouragement, confidence and motivation as part of the collaborative process. This support which goes beyond communication and collaborative skills is essential to success and further promotes cohesion within the group.\n\nThere is a relationship between language usage in spectator sports and how the nonverbal works in increasing the solidarity of team members and admirers. (Rajan, 2009) Stating that sports psychology can be considered as an applied science, the author explains the way psychology is working in the field of sports and training. There are many metaphors that are used in sports that compare it to war; this is especially evident when an athlete trains with the discipline of a soldier in preparation for competition. Athlete uniforms take the place of soldier armor and terms such as win, defeat and battlefield take on the same meaning as they would in a combat warzone. Nonverbal communication increases the confidence and solidarity of team members to perform cohesively leading to a successful outcome.\n\nThe extremely competitive nature of sports requires intense motivation, preparation and practice to achieve a desired level of performance. Beyond physical preparation as an aid to success, athletes need to be mentally prepared and confident in their ability to perform during competition. Sports and exercise psychology has evolved as an interdisciplinary field involving sports psychologists’ use psychological assessment techniques and intervention strategies in an effort to help individuals to achieve their optimal physical performance by focusing on the mental aspects of performance. Psychology as a behavioral science has made its contribution towards improving sports performance by helping coaches to coach more athletes to perform efficiently and enhance athletic performance by reducing stress.\n\nAnxiety can be a deterrent that impedes athletes from achieving success by hampering their decision making ability. Regardless of individual skill level, anxiety has been found to exert a powerful influence on athlete performance in sports. The most powerful quality that elite athletes posses, is a high level self-confidence which may act as a protective shield from anxiety. Success in sports depends on trust in your own strength and ability this is especially important in coactive sports. If an athlete is well prepared for competition from the physical, technical and tactical point of view, the most important factor deciding about his/ her degree of success is self confidence. In an interactive sports team environment, team cohesion promotes athlete confidence as teammates provide encouragement and motivation through trust in their combined ability to achieve success.\n\nThe encouragement and support necessary to provide confidence and motivation to individuals within an interactive setting is a driving force for success. It is through verbal and nonverbal displays that this support is communicated among individuals within a group and trust is established. This mutually supportive approach that establishes trust within an interactive group setting further enhances cohesion and collaboration. The absence of collaboration in an individual approach to task accomplishment is characteristic of a coactive setting where there is a strong emphasis on competition. An interactive approach emphasizes mutual empowerment and team building which provides the foundation for success through encouragement and support.\n\nThere is a connection between an individual’s first experience and their first opportunity to tap into their\ncompetitive drive as self-motivation. (Way, 2009) Exposure to competition allows individuals and team members to become aware of their skills and abilities. In addition to this awareness, individuals and team members are faced with the need to develop techniques that address the resulting emotions which range from pride to disappointment. By deemphasizing competition in favor of a mutually supportive approach, individuals and teams develop strength, trust and cohesion through a framework of cooperation and teamwork which leads to success.\n\nThe research paper provides a case study of a girls running team that emphasizes competition as a secondary objective in favor of a mutually supportive and team oriented approach. The primary goal for the running team is to develop self awareness of skills and abilities while developing strength and motivation through a framework of cooperative teamwork. Through outward displays of praise and recognition for their efforts, the coaches instruct the girls to support and encourage their teammates. The need for developing techniques to channel the emotions associated with competition which ranges from pride to disappointment are not addressed by the coaches. Outward displays of praise and motivation within a cohesive team oriented environment incorporate the use of emotion in relaying a mutually supportive approach among individuals and teams.\n\nThe research study found that the practice teammates encouraging each other for their accomplishments- even when the accomplishments are not about supporting others, could lead to mutual empowerment and team building. (Way, 2009) Greater recognition of teammates’ contributions to organizational team success can be achieved through acknowledgement and pride in individual accomplishments. By emphasizing goal setting over competition allows individuals to examine their performance and develop strategies on how to improve while keeping the mutual focus on team success. Outward displays of praise and motivation that are driven by emotion which can take the form of excitement or frustration present individuals with the opportunity to channel those feelings towards fuelling team progress.\n\nThe mutually supportive approach that deemphasizes competition in favor of teams developing strength, trust and cohesion through a framework of cooperation and teamwork leads to success. Physical touch is a nonverbal form of communication characteristic of interactive settings that can transmit feelings of trust, encouragement and support. Emotions that range from pride to disappointment can be relayed both verbally and nonverbally; however, it is through outward displays of praise and recognition for their efforts, that support and encouragement is relayed among teammates. When the outward displays among teammates in an interactive setting take the form of physical touch, it results in an increase of individual and group performance.\n\nTactile communication, or physical touch, promotes cooperation between people, communicates distinct emotions, soothes in times of stress, and is used to make inferences of warmth and trust. (Kraus et al. 2010) The researchers predicted that physical touch in group competition contributes to increased individual and group performance. Teamwork and cooperative behaviors between teammates further explained the association between touch and team performance in the National Basketball Association. As the most highly developed sense at birth, touch in human beings promotes and communicates trust, cooperative bonds and group functioning. In interactive team sports such as basketball, touch is used to convey support, praise and recognition for individual efforts while contributing to a cohesive team environment.\n\nThe researchers tested two hypotheses, there was the expectation that touch early in the basketball season to influence both individual and team performance later on in the season. They reasoned that better group performances are achieved as a result of increased cooperative behaviors brought about by the association between touch and trust. The second expectation was that cooperative behaviors between teammates would be enhanced and lead to improved team performance in competition. The extent to which teammates engaged in cooperative behaviors is mediated by the association between touch and performance where increased touch between teammates would contribute to greater performance. The tactile behavior of 294 players from all 30 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams was coded for physical touch and cooperation during one game played within the first two months of the start of the 2008-2009 NBA regular season.\n\nThe researchers found that performance in competitive group settings is enhanced by physical touch as demonstrated by teams during NBA games. Touch was also associated with higher performance at the individual and group level. In analyzing the cooperative functions of touch, the study showed that touch is a contributing factor to performance through promoting trust and cooperation between teammates. In conveying praise and recognition for teammate’s efforts, touch is used to communicate support and encouragement which enhances group performance through building cooperation. It is suggested that because touch may promote group functioning during competition by enhancing cooperation and performance, touch interventions could be used to promote relationships between students and teachers, or to strengthen bonds between romantic partners. In addition, certain forms of touch that are associated with elevated status may help individuals ascend status hierarchies within team settings and promote further cohesion.\n\nTouch amongst players on sports teams is one of the most common and beneficial forms of non-verbal communication between teammates, especially basketball. Mainly occurring in celebration of a positive play, examples of touch include “fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles” (Kraus et al. 2010). Through its ability to transmit information and feelings among players, touch increases cooperation and trust between them as well and increases in trust, most notably, translate to increases in sports performance.\n\nTouch has the ability to improve group coordination and harmonization due to its ability to convey “perceptions, thoughts, and/or feelings” (Hertenstein 2002). Thus, if one teammate wanted to congratulate another on a good play or wanted another player to understand what they were thinking or feeling, touch would be an effective medium of communication. This communication often occurs after one teammate has done something worth congratulation, such as a good point or a successful play.\n\nThe repeated use of touch for these situations, however, may lead some to think that the value of touch for the receiver may diminish. It is an understandable conclusion – if the use of touch becomes almost autonomous among players after a point is scored or a play made, is there truly any feeling to be received? In a word: yes. Even if the person giving the touch is simply going through the motions of it, it can still be meaningful to the person receiving it. The giver of the touch “may not be mindful that they are providing tactile stimulation…for communication to occur” (Hertenstein 2002).\n\nAdditionally, Hertenstein notes that if touch is consistently used in a similar situation (again, such as in the case of a good pass or difficult shot pulled off), then it will be associated with the feelings that accompany that situation; “memory for the particular context of tactile experiences likely influences the meaning of a given stimulus” (2002). Thus, since basketball players consistently employ touch in beneficial situations to them, the player receiving the celebratory touch will come to associate touch with good feelings and success.\n\nTouch has traditionally been found to increase and strengthen cooperation. For example, in one economic game where the goal of the research was to determine if various forms of non-verbal communication caused an increase in cooperation and create relationships between originally separated players, it was established that “being touched is a cue that one is in a close social relationship with the person touching,” and a great deal of “evidence exists that touch can increase cooperation” (Kurzban 2001). These two cues signify the ability of touch to enhanced closeness and, perhaps more importantly, create trust among teammates.\n\nTouch creates and improves trust, which is key in promoting increased performance for sports teams. Williams and Bargh explored how trust was created through short tactile sensations of warmth, similar to the kind that can be produced by the quick touches between basketball players. They first looked at the brain, noting that the insular cortex, which is responsible for “processing both the physical and the psychological versions of warmth information…is also involved in feelings of trust, empathy, and social emotions” (2008). Then, in a study which used a cup of hot coffee as a quick warmth stimulus, found that “people who had briefly held the hot coffee cup perceived the target person as being significantly warmer” (where interpersonal warmth is defined as trust). Thus, “a brief warm or cold physical experience influenced participants’ subsequent interpersonal judgments of a target person” (2008). Not only did the warm cup of coffee – which again can be associated with the warm touch of a teammate – create a quick sensation of trust between two people, it created a long-lasting feeling of trust.\n\nFollowing the results of this study, it can be concluded that touch between teammates would also improve the trust between them. Trust has been noted to improve commitment between people and increase a person’s ability to depend on others when necessary (Wieselquist et al. 1999). This can lead to better strategic plays within the basketball game itself, where players allow themselves to utilize their teammates better. One way this could occur within the game is with passing the ball, especially with an “inside pass” or a pass that occurs within the free-throw line; passing the ball this close to the opposing team’s basketball hoop would require a certain amount of trust from the player passing the ball to the person they pass it to. And after a study done which compared the amount of inside passes to the amount of points scored, “results suggest to consider the inside pass as a performance indicator in basketball” (Courel et al. 2013).\n\nFollowing these studies and the research done, it can concretely be concluded that touch sparks and builds trust. More important, however, is the fact that trust between team mates is an indicator of performance.\n\nIt is a simple, common-sense conclusion, best summed up by this statement: “trust is an integral part of teamwork because team tasks require a high level of interdependence between members” (Mach et al. 2010). You cannot have a sports team that functions in any capacity if they do not trust each other. Without trust, team mates would act independently and performance would suffer greatly compared to those other teams who utilized trust to achieve better performance – such as better plays within the game (see Courel et al. 2013). There is a definite link between “a commitment to the team’s objectives, team performance, and increased coordination and cooperation” (Mach et al. 2010). As Ken Jones puts it, “with trust comes a new attitude that will encourage you to do what you have to do to succeed. Mere reliance will not be motivationally sufficient” (Mach et al. 2010).\n\nOne study was performed where researchers used questionnaires and interviews to determine trust levels between teammates on various professional sports teams (including basketball) and then compared the results to performance; performance was measured by taking the “total points won for every game by each team at the end of the season, [dividing] by the points they could have earned potentially if they had won all their games, then multiplying this ﬁgure by 100.” The results determined that “trust in teammates was positively related to performance measures” (Mach et al. 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, there is a definite line of logic that can be followed regarding touch and its effect on performance. Touch between team mates has the ability to transmit information and good feelings which culminate in trust; touch can also create trust through sensory information – in this case warmth – sent to the brain. This trust then translates into increased performance through enhanced cooperation and commitment.\n\nResearch Question\n\nBased on the relationship between touch, team competition, team relationships and performance thus far, our research hypothesis was that greater in-game contact between teammates leads to greater performance and success in basketball.\n\nMethod\n\nDoes more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nWe sought to determine whether there was a relationship between the amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team over the duration of a season and greater success in their record of winning games. The independent variable, in game-contact, was coded for the Salem State University men’s basketball team and their opponents, the visiting basketball teams, to test our hypotheses. The basketball team’s in-game contact was coded during the home games of the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season. Games were coded and measured for in-game contact by two separate coders by watching publicly available archived footage of home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist of various possible touches derived from a similar study, in-game contact for the two teams competing.\n\nThe coders judged the occurrence of in-game contact of the Salem State University men’s basketball and their opponents. Coders recorded each touch between players and the type of touch. Coding focused on intentional forms of touch; thus, contact resulting directly from playing basketball (e.g., fighting for position, setting screens) was not coded. In addition, due to unreliable camera angles we chose not to code touch during timeouts, or during the end of game quarters. We focused our analysis on twelve distinct types of touch that occurred when two or more players were in the midst of celebrating a positive play that helped their team (e.g., making a shot). These celebratory touches included fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles. (Kraus, Huang & Keltner, 2010) Once our data was compiled, we searched for statistical correlation between touches and performance.\n\n\n\nPerformance and success in basketball can be assessed using a number of indicators but scoring points has typically been considered one of the best ways to measure performance. The dependent variable, greater success in basketball, or more specifically the Salem State University men’s basketball team’s winning record including the scoring totals for home games was compiled for the 2012-2013 season. Scoring totals are a practical measure of performance and success in basketball because they can be calculated using statistics readily available on the Salem State University athletics websites. Conceptually, scoring totals are a valid measure of performance because they measure efficiency in terms of gaining and using possessions, a necessary part of scoring points and winning games.\n\nThere are many other variables that may influence and determine a basketball team’s level of success over the duration of a season while contributing to a winning or losing record. These variables include, but are not limited to, crowd support, player fatigue, skill level of the team, length of season, and team chemistry. Salem Access Television in conjunction with Salem State University is responsible for providing coverage of all the university sporting events including hockey and the recently concluded basketball season. These games are recorded for both the Salem State University sports team coaching staffs and for broadcast on Salem Access Television. For the purpose of the research study, publicly available archived season footage of all the Salem State University men’s basketball home games was obtained from Salem Access Television and reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAfter coding a total of eight of the 2012-2013 men’s college basketball season home games between Salem State and their opponents for in-game contact, number of points scored and their record of winning games we found that Salem State had won seven out of the eight games coded. In each of the eight games, the in-game contact between Salem State teammates exceeded the amount of contact between the teammates on their opponents visiting teams. At face value, these results positively answered our research question- Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nDue to the many other variables that may influence and determine a basketball teams level of success over the duration of a season while contributing to a winning or losing record. We sought to establish whether there was a correlation between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored for the number of games coded (eight) and the number of teams coded for each game (16).\n\nWhen it comes to Inferential Statistics, The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is measured on a standard scale it can only range between -1.0 and +1.0. As such, we can interpret the correlation coefficient as representing an effect size. It tells us the strength of the relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of .10 is thought to represent a weak or small association; a correlation coefficient of .30 is considered a moderate correlation; and a correlation coefficient of .50 or larger is thought to represent a strong or large correlation. The results of our correlation study (N=16) between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome (0.204637431)\n\nBased on the logic of hypothesis testing, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis- There is no relationship between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored- because the association we found in our study was not statistically significant. In other words: we had not demonstrated that the association we had found was too large to simply have occurred by chance.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study attempted to find a positive connection between the amount of contact a team has between its members and the teams overall performance. Our findings have shown that, while we may not be able to reject our null hypothesis, there may be some connection between the amount of contact and an increase in performance for a basketball team. This result is one which begins to emulate the findings of similar studies (Kraus et. al 2010) and is the natural result of conclusions previously drawn regarding touch. The literature on contact, touch, and team sports shows a simple and logical line of reasoning regarding the effect that touch can have on trust, interteam relations, and team performance. This is an important connection that may be overlooked by collegiate sports departments and professional leagues. Our study tapped into this line of reasoning, but did not fully deliver on its premise.\n\nOur study did have its strengths. After a careful review of the available literature, we drew conclusions that were backed up, though mildly, by our findings. We had immediate access to several Salem State basketball games to review, and our coding sheet – taken from a very similar study published in a scholarly journal – was solid. To make sure the coding between both us was similar, we overlapped coding one game and compared the results; our results were 87.9% similar, which gave us the confidence to be able to code the rest of the games separately.\n\nThere were, however, various weaknesses in our study as well. First, we did not have many games available to look at. With only 8 games, we did not have a large enough pool of results to draw from to confidently be able to reject the null hypothesis even with a potentially stronger correlation. In addition to this, Salem State won 7 of the 8 games; with this result, we were unable to compare accurately the effect that touch had on wins and losses and thus had to discard one of our initial variables.\n\nAnother weakness in our study was the fact that not every game was recorded by the same camera man, and thus there were differences in how the games could be viewed by the coders. Some cameramen would zoom out and show a larger portion of the court, while others would zoom in on the current action. This, obviously, changes how much contact the coders can see at any given time and thus might skew the results. Some cameramen also faded in and out at different times, some showing more downtime between timeouts and halftime and others showing less.\n\nAnother weakness lies in the fact that every single one of the games that we viewed and had access to were home games. One study, done to calculate the advantage of home teams and “quantify the advantage of a home victory” found that “A significant advantage for home teams was observed across all conditions” (Jameson 2010). Thus, the fact that Salem State won so many times and scored as well as it did might be attributed more to the fact that these games were home games and less to the fact that there was a good amount of contact. Alternatively, there is a chance that there was more contact because they were home games as well, but any supposition is merely speculation at this point. Along with this point on home games, another thing which must be considered is crowd support for teams – some away teams had audible and visible crowd support while others had little to none.\n\nOne must also consider the fact that some teams are simply better than others and are going to score more points regardless of the amount of contact that is made between their team or the other’s. There are schools who pour, as mentioned in the introduction, large amounts of money into athletic programs and do their best to attract the greatest athletes into their departments; these schools simply will, in the majority of cases, have the best teams and score more points against a team which has less resources at its disposal no matter what.\n\nFinally, there are other small things which could possibly affect the results of this study. The fatigue level of a team, for example, could affect the amount of contact: extra energy could cause team mates to engage in more contact with each other, whereas a team with little energy could use less contact to conserve what they have but still score well because they conserved it.\n\nWe would advise other researchers to continue in our line of study due to the potential for real, concrete results that we may have scratched the surface of. However, we would want them to make some major changes in how they approach the study to eliminate the various weaknesses we had in ours. First, they should view a larger number of games between many different teams, both home and away. Second, they should record the games themselves and use a constant, wide out zoom so they can view the entirety of the court and catch all of the contact on camera for later coding. Third, researchers should go to greater lengths to standardize and homogenize the coding between the various coders so there is less of a difference between the coding and a greater chance for genuine, accurate results; another way to go about this is to have every game coded a number of times and to average the number of contacts recorded.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the research question – Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball? – we sought to determine whether there was a relationship between the amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team over the duration of a season and greater success in their record of winning games. The Salem State University men’s basketball team and their opponents in-game contact was coded during the home games of the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season. Games were coded and measured for in-game contact by two separate coders by watching publicly available archived footage of home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist, in-game contact for both teams in its various forms.\n\nThe coders judged the occurrence of in-game contact of the Salem State University men’s basketball and their opponents. Coders recorded each touch between players and the type of touch.

These celebratory touches included fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles. (Kraus, Huang & Keltner, 2010)\n\nPerformance and success in basketball can be assessed using a number of indicators but scoring points has typically been considered one of the best ways to measure performance. We sought to establish whether there was a correlation between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored for the number of games coded and the number of teams coded for each game. The results of our correlation study between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome.\n\nAlthough results of our correlation study  between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome, we found that Salem State had won seven out of the eight 2012-2013 men’s college basketball season home games that were coded. In each of the eight games, the in-game contact between Salem State teammates exceeded the amount of contact between the teammates on their opponents visiting teams. At face value, these results positively answered our research question- Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCourel, J., Suárez, E., Ortega, E., Piñar, M., & Cárdenas, D.

          "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs. LeBron: Who Faced Tougher Competition in the NBA Finals?\n\nBy Jason McIntyre | Jun 26, 2013\n\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James.\n\nMichael Jordan finished his brilliant NBA career with six championships. LeBron James â only 28 â has won two titles. Nate Silver of the Times had a great breakdown of where they both were at 28, and what LeBronâs chances are of catching Jordanâs six rings. (Spoiler: 30 percent). Also, hereâs a graphic that was making the rounds on the internet over the weekend that you may be interested in:\n\nUndeniable: LeBron has accomplished more at this stage in his NBA career than Jordan has. [Counter: But Jordan went to college!]\n\nI wanted to take a slightly different angle. The 80âs belonged to Magic and Larry. Magicâs last game in his prime was in 1991 (letâs not count that brief run in 1996), and Birdâs was in 1992 at the age of 35. Then, Michael Jordan took over. Many a basketball argument has boiled down to, âhey, Jordan was beating up on a watered-down league compared to the 80s â there were far fewer legendary stars.â [Counter: Huh? The 80s were all Lakers/Celtics with a smattering of Dr. J, Moses and the Pistons.]\n\nI thought itâd be interesting to look back at the teams Jordan beat in his six trips to the Finals against the four teams LeBron has faced in the Finals so far.\n\n1991: Bulls 4, LA Lakers 1 â Lakers won Game 1, Bulls owned rest of the series. Scott & Worthy were hurt and missed Game 5. Scott took just 18 shots in the series.\n1992: Bulls 4, Portland 2 â Probably the weakest team the Bulls beat in Jordanâs six trips to the Finals. Won 57 games. Drexler in his prime.\n1993: Bulls 4, Phoenix 2 â Iâd listen to an argument that all of LeBronâs Finals opponents were better than this Suns team. Won 62 games. Barkley was the NBA MVP.\n\n1996: Bulls 4, Seattle 2 â A good Sonics team, and Kemp had a beastly series, but heâs not Dirk, thatâs for sure. Won 64 games.\n1997: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Might be the best team Jordan beat in the Finals. Karl Malone was the League MVP. Won 64 games.\n1998: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Virtually the exact same core as the year prior. Won 62 games.\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the teams Jordan beat in the Finals: 1) 91 Lakers, 2) 97 Jazz, 3) 98 Jazz, 4) 93 Suns, 5) 96 Sonics, 6) 92 Blazers.\n\nLeBronâs Final opponents? This is probably due to recency bias, but Iâd say theyâve been considerably tougher than the teams Jordan beat:\n\n2007: Spurs 4, Cavaliers 0 â The Spurs went 16-4 in the playoffs. Tim Duncan is a Top 10 player in NBA history and better than any of the players Jordan beat, with the exception of Magic. [Counter: 1991 Magic led the NBA in turnovers, his shooting from the field was in steady decline, he was only 2nd in the NBA in assists, and the Lakers were at the end of their dynasty, finishing 2nd in the West.] Tony Parker was the MVP of this series, and just for fun â¦ in the annals of NBA history, who will wind up thought of as the better player, Tony Parker or Gary Payton? Tony Parker or John Stockton?\n\n2011: Mavericks 4, Heat 2 â Dirk Nowitzki is considered one of the best shooting forwards in NBA history. Barkley or Dirk? Barkley was 29 on his only trip to the Finals, and averaged 27 points and 13 rebounds in that series. He had 32-12-10 in a Game 4 loss, and 42-13 in a Game 2 loss. Dirk or Kemp? Dirk or Mailman? Dirk averaged 26-9 in the 2011 Finals, and made 45 of 46 free throws. Fun discussion where thereâs no right or wrong answer: Was Dirk a more complete player than Barkley, Kemp and Mailman? The Mavs beat Kobe, Durant and LeBron in the postseason.\n\n2012: Heat 4, Thunder 1 â Difficult to say how good this Thunder team was. We may not know for a few years. But at this rate, Durant and Westbrook (assuming they stick together) could end up having Hall of Fame careers and being similar to Stockton/Malone, who went to the Finals twice. Jordan never faced a dominant young scoring tandem such as Durant and Westbrook in the Finals.\n\n2013: Heat 4, Spurs 3: Duncan at 37, Ginobili at 35. And San Antonio benefited from the Westbrook injury (and swept the Lakers minus Kobe). The West was such a mess, the Spurs struggled against the Warriors (4-2), then swept the Grizzlies, who were only there because of the Westbrook injury. Iâd compare these Spurs tot he 1991 Lakers, but that Laker team was injured and not nearly as old. Comparing across decades is impossible and an exercise in futility, but wouldnât this yearâs Spurs team have beaten any of Jordanâs Finals opponents?\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the 10 opponents Jordan and LeBron have faced in the Finals:\n\n1. 2007 Spurs (LeBron)\n2. 1991 Lakers (Jordan)\n3. 2011 Mavericks (LeBron)\n4. 1997 Jazz (Jordan)\n5. 1998 Jazz (Jordan)\n6. 2013 Spurs (LeBron)\n7. 2012 Thunder (LeBron)\n8. 1993 Suns (Jordan)\n9. 1996 Sonics (Jordan)\n10. 1992 Blazers (Jordan)\n\nÂ© 2025 TheBigLead - All Rights Reserved\n\n"

LeBron’s foes, meanwhile, have an offensive rating that averaged out to 4.1 and a defensive rating that averaged out to 4.4.\n\nBy individual accolades, Jordan has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, two All-NBA 2nd, two All-NBA 3rd, three All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd tea.\n\nLeBron has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, seven All-NBA 2nd, three All-NBA 3rd, six All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd team.\n\nBoth of them have gone up against two MVPs.\n\nAnother user Naabahs, commented on the thread, this time comparing LeBron and Jordan’s opponents via SRS or Simple Rating System.

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something. \nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\nThe overall picture\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\nNot so fast...\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\nIt's not just the first round either.\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat. \nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\nHardest Pre-Finals Opponents\nTeam    Round   Rating  Who?

Yes.\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\nFinals opponents\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year. \nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition. \nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\nEvery Finals Opponent\nTeam    Rating  Opponent\n2017 Warriors   1850    LeBron\n2015 Warriors   1802    LeBron\n2016 Warriors   1790    LeBron\n1998 Jazz   1762    MJ\n1997 Jazz   1751    MJ\n2012 Thunder    1737    LeBron\n2014 Spurs  1730    LeBron\n2011 Mavericks  1717    LeBron\n2013 Spurs  1711    LeBron\n2018 Warriors   1710    LeBron\n2007 Spurs  1705    LeBron\n1992 Blazers    1702    MJ\n1991 Lakers 1697    MJ\n1996 Sonics 1695    MJ\n1993 Suns   1634    MJ\nIt's a team sport!\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\nIt's impossible to know.\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings. \nELO Rating in Finals\n    Jordan  LeBron\nTeam rating 1770    1687\nOpponent    1706    1750\nDifference  +64 -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\nMJ and LeBron in Finals\nInfogram\nWhat does all of this mean?\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\nMICAH ADAMS\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.

          "raw_content": "How the Dennis Rodman trade helped the Chicago Bulls\n\nStephen Beslic | Apr 9, 2023\n\nBefore the start of the 1995-96 season, the Chicago Bulls traded backup center Will Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for Dennis Rodman, who was then a two-time NBA champion, four-time NBA rebounding champion, and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAt the time of the trade, Rodman was considered highly talented, but also extremely controversial. Rodman clashed with coaches, teammates, and the media during his time in San Antonio, so the Spurs were eager to move on from him despite his impressive rebounding abilities.\n\nImproving frontcourt defense\n\nThe Bulls saw an opportunity to add an excellent defender and rebounder to their already talented roster. Rodmanâs presence helped the Bulls improve their frontcourt defense which gave them a better chance of winning another NBA championship.\n\nBulls general manager Jerry Krause and head coach Phil Jackson talked a lot with Rodman before trading for him. According to Jackson, Krause left the decision to acquire Rodman up to him. Jordan and Pippen approved the move.\n\nâPhil and I talked very carefully about this,â Krause said. âWe did an awful lot of homework and found out a lot of things. We were both satisfied.â\n\nThe Rodman effect\n\nThe Bulls were hurting on the boards since losing Horace Grant to free agency in 1994, and Jordanâs return forced Toni Kukoc to play out of position at power forward.\n\nThe 1995-96 campaign was the final year of Rodmanâs contract, and he exceeded expectations, averaging 5.5 points, 2.5 assists and a league-best 14.9 rebounds in 32.6 minutes over 64 games in the regular season while behaving well. The Bulls decided to extend his contract for two more years.\n\nâThe one promise we made to Dennis, was, we said at the beginning, when we first talked, we said at the end of the year we will sit down and weâll talk about the future, and I think thatâs what we are gonna do, we are going to sit down at the end of the year,â Krause told Jim Gray from NBC Sports before the Bulls played the Magic in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nâDennis has been outstanding, he hasnât missed a practice, he hasnât been late, heâs done the things weâve asked him to do on the basketball court, heâs a tremendous practice player, Dennis has been very good for this team and I believe that heâs a good person.â\n\nRodman averaged 5.2 points, 15.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 34.6 minutes over 199 regular season games with the Bulls from 1996 to 1998. He won three rebounding titles and even averaged a career-high 3.1 assists in 1997.\n\nThe five-time NBA champion averaged 5.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 32.4 minutes over 58 playoff games with the Bulls.\n\nIn the end, the trade worked out well for the Bulls and the Spurs. Rodman thrived in Chicago, playing a crucial role in helping the Bulls win three NBA championships in a row from 1996 to 1998.\n\nPerdue, on the other hand, played a solid role for the Spurs as a backup center, and they went on to win their first NBA championship in 1999.\n\nStephen Beslic is a writer on Sports Illustrated's FanNation Network.

          "raw_content": "Untitled design\n\nNBA in the 1990s vs. Modern Day: Which Era is Better\n\nby Elie Gaffen | Feb 1, 2023 | Headlines, NBA\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\nJOH SWART/AP\n\nThere is often a lot of debate between generations of NBA fans on the topic of which era of basketball was “better”. Now, there are many factors that go into making one era of basketball “better” over the other. I put that word into quotations because better is subjective, especially using the formula I follow. Either way, I am making the case for why the NBA in the 1990s was a golden era for basketball fans.\n\nOne of the main reasons that the NBA was better in the 90s is the level of competition. The league was home to some of the most iconic and talented teams in history, such as the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics. The combinations these teams had of dominant star power and prominent role players ruled the decade.\n\n[mm-video type=playlist id=01g02gm8ss4hdkf69q player_id=01fknyrrh48xrn02qp image=]\n\nTwo rosters that are often compared between the 90s and the current state of the NBA were the Bulls of the 90s and the Golden State Warriors of 2015-2018. These are two of the most successful teams in NBA history. While both teams achieved great success, there are some key differences between the two.\n\nOne of the most significant differences is the style of play. The Bulls relied on Michael Jordan to be their primary scorer and be their go-to in clutch situations. Around Jordan were a mixture of prominent players that can stand in their own right; however, it was primarily role players that built the team to what we know them as. On the other hand, the Warriors put an emphasis on ball movement and three-point shooting. They had a longer list of All-Star players than the Bulls did.\n\nThe style of play in the NBA has changed significantly since the 1990s. This is the subjective aspect of the era comparison. It all depends on what style of play keeps your eyes peeled and gets you excited. One major difference in the style of play and one that leads me to prefer the 90s is the emphasis on physicality. This era was known for its tough, rugged play, with hard fouls and physical play being a common occurrence. However, the current era of the NBA is more focused on player safety, which leads to a reduction in physical play. There are many fouls that are called today that wouldn’t be called in the 90s. Player safety is extremely important, but the toughness in previous eras of basketball are more enjoyable.\n\nThe current NBA emphasizes the use of the three-point shot, which was very unlike the league in the 90s. Teams used to rely more on driving to the basket and working the ball inside, rather than taking long-range shots. Now teams use the three-point shot as a part of their game and some players often emphasize it as a part of their game. With more inside play, defense was also more emphasized in the 1990s. In contrast, the current era of the NBA places a greater emphasis on offense, leading to higher scoring games but also a decrease in the level of defensive play. Not only that, but the new era has led to players being more reliant on their talent and physical attributes rather than their basketball IQ in addition to their talent.\n\nIt seems like the amount of intensity and passion to the league and the games is less prevalent than there once was. Teams are more likely to put their passions to complain about a foul called on them rather than putting their passions to winning games and being left hungry for more when losing games. This has led to the 1990s being the superior era of the NBA over the modern era.\n\nTWSN is committed to delivering high-quality sports content that stands out in today’s fast-paced media world.

Who doesn't like and appreciate the physicality of the games in the 80s and 90s, with players like Magic Johnson and Penny Hardaway at the point guard positions, things were nasty on the hardwood back in the day.\n\nThis decade of NBA has really hit hard on the infamous rivalries between the teams, thanks to players changing teams to win the championships instead of leading their forte to the gold. Gone are the days when matchups like the Boston Celtics vs Los Angeles Lakers bought the viewers to the edge of their seats.\n\nThe veteran NBA players on numerous occasions claimed that the present day NBA is \"Soft\". It has been a topic of debate whether the NBA is as entertaining as it used to be. Back in the day, Reggie Miller after hitting the game winning 3-pointer against the New York Knicks, followed it by the infamous \"Taunt\" to Spike Lee sitting on the sidelines, did not get him a Technical Foul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the NBA today, fans may see their team player be ejected out of the game for a little trash talk.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThis contrast in the style of game between the two eras can be traced back to the NBA introducing the \"No hand check\" rule in the mid-2000's. This rule has not only altered the playstyle by reducing the contact in the game but has also made the game faster and skill-oriented. This rule, however, if introduced in Jordan's era, we would have been looking at more than 30 PPG as his career stat.\n\nThe new age NBA has also witnessed the skyrocketing number of threes launched, owing to the likes of Steph Curry's and the Golden State Warriors. The players camp up at the three-point line or make screening efforts to free their shooter to hit the 3 shot. As spectacular as the splashes are, it has further reduced the number of plays actually seeing some rim action. The game today, demands even the power and small forwards with some skill at the 3 point line. We see big men line LeBron James and Kevin Durant making the game-winning 3s.\n\nThe league then introduced the \"No forearm check\" rule which reduced the already depleted contact between the opposing players. The defenders then had to rely on their feet to defend the oncoming offense. This had a huge impact on the mid-range game, where Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley dominated. Also, now with \"flopping\" being as nasty as it is in football, NBA is seeing very little defense and a failed crossover brings the audience to its feet.\n\nTalking about the badass 90s in the league, who does not miss the centers like Dikembe Mutombo and David Robinson? Their dominating guard in the paint was like a cannon defending a fort. The Seven ft. human barriers would serve as a challenge to all the offense. Patrick Ewing's post moves with Shaq's domination would show how much physical that era was.\n\nToday, Joakim Noah and Dwight Howard do not show that level of dominance and pivotal role in the game as it was earlier. This can be dated back to the days when the \"Offensive 3-second rule\" was announced. This rule, over the years, impacted the position of the center and evolved them to the power forward side.\n\nIt is no surprise that the NBA now is more play and calculated strategy oriented game. Kyrie Irving and Russel Westbrook have shown how point guards are beyond just passing and making assists. It will be exciting to see how the NBA from here on evolves and amazes it viewers which it has been doing since years.\n\nanant vijay\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nRanking Each Decade of NBA Basketball, from the 1960s to Today\n\nThroughout NBA history, we've experienced the purity of the 1960s, the creativity and growth of the '70s, the sheer competitive nature of the '80s, the on-court brilliance of the '90s, the raw athleticism of the '00s and the yet-to-be-determined, but certainly impressive, legacy of our current decade.\n\nThey all bring different elements to the table, but which one is the best of all time?\n\nIn order to put each of the six decades into their proper order, we've asked six writers to make a case for their favorite era, and we've also asked B/R's NBA writers and editors to rank them from best to worst in six different categories: entertainment value, competitive balance, athleticism, overall quality of play and star power.\n\nForty-five writers and editors participated in this voting, with an average age of 26.1.\n\nEach category was weighted evenly, and the overall rankings were determined by the decades' standings in these six criteria. Receiving a 6.00 in a category was the best possible result, as that would indicate that each of the 45 NBA writers polled gave that decade the top spot. Conversely, a 1.00 in a category means that all 45 writers voted that decade last.\n\nThe scores for each category were summed to produce the overall ranking, with 30 being a perfect score.\n\nYou'll see our opinions here, but which decade was the greatest in your eyes, and why?\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 8.55)\n\n\n\nThe NBA in the 1960s was rougher, tougher, smaller and less visible than just about every decade that followed. But it may have been the best basketball decade of them all.\n\nThe Boston Celtics dominated. Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a game. Jerry West modeled the NBA logo, the league expanded and television audiences took notice.\n\nThe brutish big man was the prized commodity in an era characterized by physicality. Chamberlain and Bill Russell won nine of the 11 MVP awards between 1958 and 1968.\n\nWhile condensed in size and geographical scope, the league possessed some of the greatest players to ever set foot on the court.\n\nAnd like the world around it, the NBA went through major changes during the 1960s.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.58)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.22)\n\nBack then, baseball ruled. My heroes were Mickey Mantle and Sandy Koufax, men who transcended their sport and lived in the mainstream consciousness. Chamberlain and Russell, despite their impact night in and night out, didn’t make the same headlines, and so I didn’t consider them superstars.\n\nLeague-wide attendance at MLB games in 1965 was 22 million, while the NBA drew a paltry two million fans for its games.\n\nThe NBA may have had great athletes, but when your sport is only televised once a week—Sundays on ABC—it’s hard to get any kind of notoriety.\n\nThis was pre-David Stern, pre-Nike and pre-superhuge television contracts. When Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors, only 4,124 fans witnessed it. And even then, it didn’t immediately translate into sponsorship dollars for the big man.\n\nImagine LeBron going off for 30, 11 and 10—you’ll know within minutes via your mobile app or by checking any mainstream sports website. But back in the day, as they say, you wouldn’t know until the next day’s morning newspaper.\n\nBut, it really wasn’t until Willis Reed’s gimpy heroics in Game 7 against the L.A. Lakers of the 1969-70 Finals that the world began to take notice of the league.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 2.24)\n\nQuite simply, there really wasn’t any competitive balance.\n\nLed by Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek and coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won nine championships, including eight straight from 1959-66, the longest championship streak in NBA history.\n\nIn fact, some consider the 1964-65 Celtics to be the best NBA team ever.\n\nSure, the Lakers played in the Finals seven times in 10 years, but it was hardly a two-team league, as the St. Louis Hawks, San Francisco Warriors, Baltimore Bullets and Cincinnati Royals also sported solid teams.\n\nYet, rather than fade away due to lack of competition, the NBA would flourish in ensuing years.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.67)\n\nIt is doubtful that there is another era with as many great stars. Bob Cousy, Bill Bradley, Jerry Lucas, Nate Thurmond, Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Dave Bing, Earl Monroe and John Havlicek stand out, but here are five that created NBA standards.\n\nPut LeBron James and Magic Johnson together, and you get Oscar Robertson. At 6”5’, 220 pounds, the Big O was a big guard playing against smaller competitors and the only player to have averaged a triple-double for a season.\n\nJerry West exemplified the ideal of fundamental basketball so perfectly he became the model for the NBA icon and was known as “Mr. Clutch” for his uncanny ability to win games when it mattered most.\n\nWilt Chamberlain may have been the greatest athlete of his day. At 7’1”, 275 pounds, he had been a track star before turning the game of basketball on end with his dominance. In the 1961-62 season alone, he averaged an unprecedented 50.4 points per game, during which he had 100-, 78-, 73- and 67-point games.\n\nWere it not for Bill Russell, it may have been Chamberlain holding the most NBA championships. But, Russell, at only 6’9”, understood the idea of team play and redefined the role of the NBA big man. Russell won 11 titles, including eight consecutively. He was a rebounding machine and averaged 22.5 rebounds per game, once taking down 51 in a single game.\n\nWithout Elgin Baylor, there would be no Dr. J, no Dominique Wilkins and perhaps no Michael Jordan. The high-flying small forward had ridiculous hang time, averaged a double-double most of his career and, during the 1961-62 season, put up 38.3 PPG, second only to Wilt in NBA history.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.84)\n\nNine. That’s how many times Jerry West had his nose broken as he ventured into the key for a layup. Today’s freewheeling guards would have thought twice about going inside against the likes of Wilt, Russell, Nate “The Great” Thurmond and Jerry Lucas.\n\nThe era preceded the three-point shot, so inside-big-man toughness coupled with excellent fundamental play make the 1960s the decade to contend with.\n\nThe '60s were also a time of radical change as players such as Walt Frazier, Dave Bing and Earl “The Pearl” Monroe brought an inventive flair to the court. By the end of decade, the offense extended its play to the perimeter, ball-handlers proliferated and the NBA never looked back.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 13.04)\n\n\n\nThe 1970s opened on the yawning chasm created by Bill Russell's retirement.\n\nAnd the NBA had a pesky competitor in the ABA, which was not so much a professional basketball league as a petri dish for the fusion of street-ball-honed agility with Harlem Globetrotter-esque showmanship.\n\nAs the movie Semi-Pro suggests, the ABA was a fly-by-night operation for some; several teams were imbued with a lunacy only equaled by Bill Veeck. Quirky halftime shows were as familiar as attempts to lure stars away from the NBA, with Rick Barry becoming the most notable turncoat.\n\nThe fledgling ABA gradually gained notoriety and actually began beating the senior league consistently in their head-to-head exhibition games. In 1976, the NBA finally accepted its red-white-and-blue stepchild as part of the family.\n\nThus, '70s basketball became acid jazz meets track and field.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.40)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.04)\n\nThis was the first decade when players other than just the gargantuan centers began to dunk with regularity. Back when he was Lew Alcindor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar prompted the NCAA to ban dunking for 10 years, but he brought that style right into the NBA.\n\nOf course, the cavalier ABA spawned various innovations in such airy flair. Not only was George \"The Iceman\" Gervin's finger roll poetry in motion, but both Julius Erving and David Thompson turned dunking into an art form. They weren't known as \"Dr. J\" and \"Skywalker\" for nothing.\n\nDr. J essentially invented the free-throw-line slam dunk at the 1976 ABA All-Star festivities, the genesis of the NBA's dunk contest. Erving etched himself into collective basketball memory with those effortlessly loping leaps.\n\nThese ABA dunkers paved the way for the backboard-breaking Darryl \"Chocolate Thunder\" Dawkins (from the planet Lovetron). The ABA also helped cement the three-point shot into rule, so Stephen Curry and Ray Allen owe the bygone league a fruit basket.\n\n\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 4.22)\n\nIn 10 years, eight different teams won the NBA title. Only the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics won more than one, and neither won back-to-back titles. The Knicks' Hall of Famers won two titles in the decade's first four years, announcing the end to the Celtics' reign of terror.\n\nBut no clear heir to the throne stepped forth, bringing some much-needed parity to the sport.\n\nThe NBA absorbed the four best teams from the ABA—the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs—helping to augment the competitive balance in pro basketball.\n\nBut the old NBA franchises still dominated, just in greater numbers.\n\nThe Washington Bullets became a powerhouse; the '77 Portland Trail Blazers formed a ragtag band of underdog champs; even the Golden State Warriors and Seattle SuperSonics each won a title.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 1.98)\n\nMany superstars wound their careers down in the '70s: Jerry West and Oscar Robertson, who got their only championships, as well as Elgin Baylor, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, John Havlicek, Lenny Wilkens, Nate Thurmond and Jerry Lucas.\n\nWilt Chamberlain passed the big-man torch to Kareem, and the stage was set.\n\nTiny Archibald and Bob McAdoo dazzled fans from both ends of the height spectrum, while Bill Walton and Artis Gilmore enthralled with their tremendous tresses. There were wild cards like Darnell Hillman and World B. Free, and anomalies like the spectacularly bearded Gar Heard, who stood 6'6\" but blocked shots like he was 7'6\".\n\nAlso on the scene were Hall of Famers Dave Bing, Bill Bradley, Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld, who were joined by Dave Cowens, \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich, Dennis Johnson, plus near-HOFers Bob Dandridge and Spencer Haywood.\n\nAnd to the list of big ABA transplants, you can write in Maurice Lucas and Dan Issel beside Skywalker and Dr. J.\n\nThe ABA also allowed Moses Malone to enter the draft right out of high school, setting the stage for Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.40)\n\nBoth despite and because of all the expansion, cocaine, salary inflation, free agency, left-wing politics and competitive parity, the '70s were a watershed for basketball.\n\nThere were ugly moments to be sure, like Kermit Washington's devastating on-court knockout of Rudy Tomjanovich.\n\nBut, ultimately, the beautiful evolution of the game won out in history. It was a decade of modernization just as much as tumult, of style as much as substance.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 18.55)\n\nThe first 10 years of the 21st century were famous (and infamous) for Lakers and Spurs dominance, 81 points scored by one player and the Malice in the Palace. A few teams—the Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks and Cleveland Cavaliers—all had brief flirtations with fame.\n\nThe 2000s also produced some of the most dramatic moments in NBA history, individual plays that will stand out for decades to come.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\n\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.29)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Second (score: 4.73)\n\nIf you were a fan of the Lakers living in Los Angeles during this decade, you were in basketball heaven.  In spite of the ongoing Kobe-Shaq feuds, the Lakers were the darlings of the local sports world.\n\nTheir home, Staples Center, first opened in October 1999, instantly becoming an entertainment icon and the place to be and be seen. Big games on big stages became commonplace, and spring in Los Angeles usually meant Lakers postseason exploits on the hardwood once more.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 3.84)\n\nThe aughts were marked by the sheer dominance of two distinctly unique franchises: the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Spurs gave hope to small-market teams by winning three championships from 2000-09, while the Lakers went to the Finals six times under Phil Jackson and won four of them.\n\nThe Spurs were built from the ground up and continue to be one of the most stable franchises due to the game's best head coach, Gregg Popovich.\n\nThe Lakers were the creation of general manager Jerry West, the mastermind who orchestrated the signings of both Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal, and the brilliant trade with Charlotte that sent Vlade Divac to the Hornets for its No. 13 pick in the 1996 draft, a young kid named Kobe Bean Bryant.\n\nExcept for one year (when Dallas made it), the NBA Finals featured either the Lakers or Spurs from the Western Conference.\n\n\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.38)\n\nKobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal grabbed most of the headlines and are locks for the Hall of Fame. But there were other greats who lit up the scoreboard or passed their way to fame during the decade.\n\nAmong the most fun to watch were Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo Anthony, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Jason Kidd and Allen Iverson.\n\nNash and Kidd are two of the best passers ever, while Nowitzki may be the best pure-shooting big man in the history of the game. Ray Allen has more three-pointers than anyone (via ESPN.com), and Bryant was lighting up scoreboards (81 points in 2006) and winning championship rings with and without the formidable O'Neal.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.31)\n\nTo win during this decade, a team needed two or three superstars and a strong bench. Individual talent was probably better than it had ever been, but some of the weaker teams just couldn't seem to get on track.\n\nUnlike the NFL, the NBA has never been about team parity. Still, it is safe to say this decade produced some of the best teams, top players and most exciting moments the league has ever been witness to.\n\nThe most improbable moment? There were many, but for me, it had to be Derek Fisher's catch, turn and shoot miracle with four-tenths of a second on the clock to beat the Spurs in Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals. That will never happen again.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 20.95)\n\n\n\nWe’re only three years into the NBA’s newest decade, but there’s already plenty of evidence to suggest that the league is heading toward a new summit.\n\nThe regular season is as entertaining as it’s been in some time, with recent postseason play redefining the standard of excellence we expect to be treated to on a nightly basis.\n\nWith a revolution occurring before our very eyes, this decade will set historic standards for what fans should expect from future generations.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Third (score: 3.87)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: First (score: 5.71)\n\nHas there ever been a more fun time to watch NBA basketball? The athletes who grace our screens every night are simply breathtaking to watch, and they’ve committed themselves to playing ferociously on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn addition, an overlooked aspect of the NBA’s entertainment value during this decade is the ubiquity with which the game is available to fans. Platforms like League Pass have allowed consumers to become more knowledgeable than ever, while social-media sites like Twitter have allowed us to engage in conversation and debate with other fans, players and pundits.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.51)\n\nAlthough we appear to be shifting to an era where super-teams like the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers are the norm, the breadth and depth of talent across the NBA is astounding.\n\nAnd, as the Heat and Lakers each proved to us in their first seasons together, super-teams aren’t blessed with immunity to seemingly \"inferior\" squads just because of the hype they receive. Despite the apparent dominance of big-market franchises, the brilliance displayed by several small-market general managers throughout the decade has provided the league with competitive balance. Success stories like those of the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder, Memphis Grizzlies and Indiana Pacers are proving that intelligent front offices can build teams that are prosperous in the long run.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 4.04)\n\nThe obvious starting point here is LeBron James, who, according to Basketball-Reference’s Hall of Fame probability calculator, is a shoo-in with a rating of 0.9987. Already possessing one NBA title, a Finals MVP and three regular-season MVP awards at the age of 28, LeBron will define the current era just like Michael Jordan did in the 1990s.\n\nHowever, aside from LeBron, there are several players who will peak during the 2010s, with studs like Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose all capable of playing at historically elite levels. You could even make the argument that Dwyane Wade’s been playing the best ball of his career since turning 30 in 2012.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 3.82)\n\nWith such a deep pool of talent, it’s no surprise that the NBA’s current decade has been characterized by an extremely high level of play.\n\nPlayers like LeBron James and Russell Westbrook continue to redefine conventional positions and squash the stereotypes that accompany them. So while the league may be in a transition phase, the expansive skill sets we see displayed on a nightly basis are simply breathtaking. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (21.08 overall)\n\n\n\nImagine your car breaking down in Bethel, N.Y., outside Max Yasgur’s dairy farm, on Aug. 15, 1969.\n\nYou see the crowd, you hear the music...and you suddenly realize something big is happening, and you are fortunate, blessed even, to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nThat’s what it was to be an NBA fan in the 1980s.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Second (score: 4.56)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.07)\n\nThe decade was unquestionably defined by the league’s greatest all-time rivalry: Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers versus Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics.\n\n“But we had Lakers-Celtics with Chamberlain and Russell,” you older readers might say.\n\nTrue. The difference is: This time, everybody was watching.\n\nThe ‘80s were the decade where, because of Bird and Magic, the league came into its own, became a part of the cultural zeitgeist and was must-see TV long before the brain trust at NBC thought of the phrase.\n\nAfter the tough times of Vietnam, Watergate, OPEC and recession, weary audiences wanted less news and more entertainment. This mood gave rise to sound bites, music videos and—thanks to ESPN, which debuted in 1979—sports-highlight shows.\n\nThe NBA’s quick, incredible vignettes were the perfect tonic for the day.\n\nThose factors, plus the transcendent popularity of Bird and Johnson, converged to take the little-watched NBA from airing tape-delayed NBA Finals games in 1981 to more than doubling ratings by the 1988 Finals.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.18)\n\nThe Lakers and Celtics owned the '80s, even though the Detroit Pistons slowly ascended to finally dethrone both champions by the decade’s end.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers won a long-deserved championship in 1983. The Houston Rockets had the original Twin Towers. The next tier included the Atlanta Hawks, the New York Knicks and the team of the future, the Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn truth, though, the decade was devoid of parity. But we didn’t want parity. We wanted—and got—Magic’s Lakers and Bird’s Celtics in the Finals.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.60)\n\nMagic and Bird were the superstars. They, not David Stern, took the NBA from a fringe sport to a juggernaut.\n\nBoth players’ teams were chock-full of superstars, too: The Lakers’ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, and the Celtics’ Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson are all Hall of Famers.\n\nIsiah Thomas, arguably the greatest point guard of all time, and fellow Pistons champions Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman are all enshrined in Springfield.\n\nJulius “Dr. J” Erving, the NBA’s face of the ‘70s, bridged the gap between the old guard and the Bird-Johnson era. His famous NBA Finals shot from 1980 would make Isaac Newton question himself.\n\nDominique Wilkins, the Human Highlight Film, lived up to his name every night.\n\nBernard King scored like a pinball machine.\n\nSuperstars like Charles Barkley, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, John Stockton, Karl Malone and Clyde “The Glide” Drexler were all in their prime. The next tier of stars—Ralph Sampson, Buck Williams, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Sidney Moncrief and George “Iceman” Gervin—were no slouches, either.\n\nAnd of course, there was some new kid named Michael Jordan.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.67)\n\nFouls could get downright brutal in the ‘80s; when those guys hit the deck, nobody was flopping.\n\nBut that meant defense was still allowed. As a result, most games were well-played and strategic, with perfectly executed give-and-gos and pick-and-rolls.\n\nThere was plenty of high-flying action, too, reminiscent of the recently absorbed ABA. For the most part, though, ‘80s play was about both fundamentals and being able to take the punishment—a combination I like to call \"real basketball.\"\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 22.82)\n\n\n\nThe 1990s were noteworthy primarily for two things, Michael Jordan and the greatest collection of big men who ever played the game.\n\nPerhaps this is what makes the decade so incredibly interesting. Jordan slew the giants. In an era of bigs like the league had never seen, it was a perimeter player who dominated the league and forever changed the game.\n\nBecause of Jordan, and the marketing success the NBA had with him, the league changed the rules to make it more of a perimeter-oriented league. Because of his success against so many great big men, teams were trying to find that player who could do what Jordan did.\n\nAs a result, in terms of the rules, marketing, philosophy and sheer aesthetic value of the game, the '90s were transitional, morphing the game from the powerful, center-dominated league of the past into the athletic, perimeter-player-dominated league of the present.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: First (score: 5.31)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Third (score: 4.22)\n\nThe ‘90s were a compelling decade for the entertainment value of the game. If you need proof, look no further than the television ratings and the television contracts.\n\nThe highest-rated Finals in NBA history was the 1998 showdown between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which rendered an 18.7 rating. Five of the highest six Finals ratings came in the decade.\n\nWhen the decade started, the NBA was receiving about $56 million a year in national broadcasting rights. When those 10 years ended, that number had swollen to more than $620 million a year.\n\nIf we measure entertainment by being entertained, it seems the ‘90s were a pretty entertaining decade.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 3.00)\n\nEven though the decade was dominated by the Chicago Bulls, who won six NBA championships, there were plenty of other teams who took turns rising up to challenge the Bulls. Because of that, it was still highly competitive.\n\nIn all, there were 11 different teams who made it to the Finals during the decade and another two who made it to the conference finals. That’s nearly half the league that made it to the conference finals and over a third of the league that played for a title.\n\nMuch of the decade was playing for the right to lose to Jordan, er, the Bulls, but it was a highly competitive time.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 5.33)\n\nThe best part of watching the NBA during the ‘90s was the sheer volume of stars.\n\nIt was an era that saw the sun set on Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nIt saw players like Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone all in their prime.\n\nThen there was Michael Jordan.\n\nIt saw the birth of the careers of Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan.\n\nIn all, there were 21 players who played at least 150 games in the ‘90s who are already in the HOF. There are several more, such as Shaquille O’Neal, Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Duncan, who are inevitably going to get in.\n\nIt’s a safe bet you could put together an All-Star team from the ‘90s that would be the greatest team ever assembled.\n\nOf course, I only say that because they did, and it was. The original Dream Team is all you need to know (with the exception of O’Neal getting passed over for Christian Laettner).\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 4.96)\n\nThe irony of the ‘90s is, when the decade started, the conversation surrounding the NBA focused on what was going to happen without Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nInstead, it became the transitional era, where the NBA surpassed baseball as the second-most-popular sport and grew in popularity like it never had before.\n\nThe beauty of the era wasn’t just the multitude of stars; it was the types of stars there were. There were the acrobatic, gravity-defying stunts of Michael Jordan.\n\nThere was the perfect pick-and-roll action from John Stockton to Karl Malone.\n\nThere was the brute greatness of Charles Barkley, who seemed to defy the logic that height mattered and, at an exaggerated 6’6”, became one of the greatest rebounders and power forwards of all time.\n\nShawn Kemp was in his prime and dunking like no one else who came before him and no one else since, save for Blake Griffin.\n\nIt was the last great era of centers, with four of the greatest to ever play the position—Robinson, Olajuwon, Ewing and O’Neal—making it to the Finals during the decade. All but Ewing won a ring.\n\nIt says something that the rules were changed after the decade ended, maintaining the way it was played. The ‘90s, in my mind, will always be the decade where the NBA truly found itself.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\n"

          "raw_content": "Complete comparison between LeBron James, Michael Jordan’s Finals opponents\n\nVirgil Villanueva\n\nSince winning multiple rings, LeBron James has crept his way into comparisons with Michael Jordan, the guy considered the best player of all time. Jordan reached the NBA Finals six times and won every one. James, meanwhile, has made it to eight times, including seven consecutive appearances, winning three titles.\n\nBut for Reddit user claimsman11, the aforementioned numbers are not enough. He posted a complete comparison between LeBron and Jordan’s opponents in the NBA Finals.\n\nConsidering all of Jordan’s opponents in the Finals, the offensive rating of those combined teams averaged out to fourth in the NBA and an defensive rating that averaged out to 7.5th in the league. LeBron’s foes, meanwhile, have an offensive rating that averaged out to 4.1 and a defensive rating that averaged out to 4.4.\n\nBy individual accolades, Jordan has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, two All-NBA 2nd, two All-NBA 3rd, three All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd tea.\n\nLeBron has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, seven All-NBA 2nd, three All-NBA 3rd, six All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd team.\n\nBoth of them have gone up against two MVPs.\n\nAnother user Naabahs, commented on the thread, this time comparing LeBron and Jordan’s opponents via SRS or Simple Rating System. The metric is rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule.\n\nThe user concluded that the average SRS for Jordan Finals opponents is 6.84, while the average SRS for LeBron Finals opponents is 8.20.\n\nApparently, the number of titles one has is not enough in determining who’s the greatest in the game. It is also determined by era and the rating of the teams they have played against.\n\n\n\n"

            "raw_content": "What's LeBron James' record in the NBA Finals? Comparing superstar forward's finals record to Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James has had a remarkable career so far, showing great longevity as he enters his 20th season in the NBA. James made his first playoff appearance during the 2005-06 season as a Cavalier.\n\nBack then, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished the regular season with a respectable 61% winning record. However, James’ playoff run was cut short, losing 4-3 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nJames came out hungry the following season, getting his revenge on the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He averaged 25.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over six games, including a 48-point performance in Game 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers won the series in six games but were swept by the fundamentalists – the San Antonio Spurs – in the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James’ four subsequent NBA Finals appearances came during his stint with the Miami Heat. Teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, James was in the NBA Finals again. However, the Dallas Mavericks came out on top in the 2011 Finals.\n\nJames was a dominant force in the following two seasons, leading his team in scoring, rebounds, and assists – in both the finals. The Miami Heat were crowned champions in 2012 & 2013, with James winning the Finals MVP in both editions.\n\nJames’ return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 sparked a new NBA Finals rivalry between them and the Golden State Warriors. They matched up in the NBA finals for four consecutive years, with LeBron James being crowned champion only once. After being swept by the Warriors in the 2018 NBA Finals, James took his services to the LA Lakers.\n\nLeBron's stint with the LA Lakers has been turbulent to say the least, given he’s made the playoffs in only two of his four seasons. Still, James did guide the Lakers to the championship in 2020.\n\nLeBron James’ NBA Finals record vs Michael Jordan’s\n\nCollectively, James has been in 10 NBA Finals, coming out victorious in four. He won the Finals MVP in all those editions, matching up as closely with his idol, Michael Jordan, as he could. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, has reached the NBA Finals just six times in his 15 seasons.\n\nHowever, Michael Jordan’s record in the NBA Finals is what sets him apart. Like James, Jordan was the top-performer in all his championship runs – earning the Finals MVP award in all six editions.\n\nBut Jordan was able to win the title in all six appearances – completing two three-peats. James’ winning percentage (40%) in the NBA Finals, taking nothing away from his efforts, will always be brought up in any comparison with Jordan.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Comparing Career Scoring Totals\n\nMitch Goldich | Mar 7, 2019\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points Wednesday in the Lakers' 115-99 loss to the Nuggets. It would likely go down as a forgettable result in a season heâd like to forget, save for one major news item: He passed Michael Jordan on the NBAâs all-time career scoring list.\n\nAs his 16th season winds down, LeBron has now racked up 32,311 points, even more than the 32,292 points MJ tallied in his 15 regular seasons. LeBron is now fourth all-time in scoring, trailing just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant.\n\nSo today is the day. I will personally make the case that determines which of these two players is better and we will all agree forever. OK, probably not. There are other places on the internet to read those kinds of takes today. Instead Iâll just present some graphs and charts to compare the scoring outputs from these two all-time greats.\n\n1. Total points by age\n\nHere are their career points scored, broken down by age. In this case age means their n-age season, basically the year they were n years old on February 1, which is the way Basketball-Reference displays ages.\n\nHere you can see the advantage LeBron gained by jumping to the league straight out of high school, as he banked 3,700 points at the same ages that had Jordan wearing Carolina blue.\n\nThen you can see MJ gaining on LeBron until his baseball years (outside of his second season, when he only played 18 games in 1985-86).\n\nNow at 34, LeBron is the same age Jordan was when he finished his Bulls career with a second three-peat.\n\n2. Total points by season\n\nThis graph is similar to the one above, but now we go by season instead of age. This takes out the advantage LeBron gets from starting younger and playing all the way through. Jordanâs trajectory is no longer stunted by taking the 1993-94 season off, though you can still see the 1995 year when he played just 17 games in his return from baseball.\n\nBy this measure, Jordan was ahead of LeBron when he hung them up after his Wizards stint.\n\n3. Points per game by age4. Points per game by season\n\nThese two graphs are the same as the first two, but instead of using cumulative career points, weâll use scoring average per game during those seasons.\n\nAgain, when Jordan isnât dinged for the seasons he missed, you can see that his scoring average per season was consistently higher for most of his career.\n\nThatâs true either way you break it down, although his scoring averages as a 38- and 39-year-old in Washington, his 14th and 15th seasons, show a noticeable dip.\n\n5. Breaking down field goals, free throws and three-pointers\n\nThese pie charts basically answer the question: How did they get their points? It shows the career breakdowns for both players, and the percentage of points that came from free throws, two-point field goals and three-pointers.\n\nTheir free throw output is very close; Jordan made 7,327 and LeBron has made 7,101.\n\nThe key difference is three-point shooting. James has made 1,714 three pointers, while Jordan made just 581. Of course thatâs a result of them being products of their era. Jordan was a career 32.7% three-point shooter, while James has made a slightly better 34.4%. If Jordan played today, three-point shooting would likely be a bigger emphasis of his gameâmore attempts and he probably would have gotten even better at it.\n\n6. Breaking down points by team\n\nOne of the key differences between their careers is that Jordan spent almost all of his with the Bulls, until his late run with the Wizards. Jordanâs most famous employer swap was from the Bulls to the Birmingham Barons and back, whereas LeBron left Cleveland for Miami, came back and then again moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThis graph simply shows how many points they scored in each of their NBA uniforms.\n\n7. Breaking down points by career stop\n\nIf youâd like to take the previous graph and break it down further, this time weâll consider each of LeBronâs stops in Cleveland separately. And while weâre at it, we can carve out Jordanâs pre-baseball and post-baseball eras in Chicago.\n\nHereâs their total output during each of the various chapters in their careers.\n\n8. Scoring leader race by season\n\nIn addition to scoring more per game and more per season relative to LeBron, one thing that stands out about Jordanâs career is the way that he dominated his peers in the scoring race.\n\nJordan led the NBA in total points 11 times, including every season from 1986-87 through 1997-98 when he wasnât playing baseball.\n\nLeBron finished second in total points in eight straight seasons from 2004-05 through 2011-12, finishing behind Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (3x), Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant (3x). He didnât lead the league in total points until last season, his first time playing 82 games.\n\nThis graph shows where they finished in the league scoring (total points, not per game), based on the number of times finishing in each spot.Â  Jordan led the league 11 times, every season of his career except the two shortened Bulls seasons and the two Wizards seasons. LeBron only has that one season leading the league, but he was consistently in the Top 5. In fact, his first season in L.A. is his only time out of the Top 10, largely because of how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nIf we used points per game to show where they stood among league leaders, the graph would look very similar. Jordanâs career scoring mark of 30.12 points per game is the all-time record, and MJ won the per game scoring title 10 times. LeBron's mark of 27.15 is fourth all-time, behind Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. (For now at least. It takes three decimal places to separate James and Durant, and LeBron actually leapfrogged KD on Wednesday.)\n\nBut again, none of this is to say that Jordan was better than LeBron. Or vice versa. They each have different careers, different skills and different stories. It would be just as simplistic to boil their entire careers down to total points as it is to reduce their careers down to championship rings. They both deserve to be appreciated for what theyâve done, and on a day thatâs natural to compare their scoring output itâs fun to compare their careers in a few different ways.\n\nMitch Goldich is a senior editor for Sports Illustrated, mostly focused on the NFL.

And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game. Jordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements.",

            "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "LeBron James Crushes Michael Jordan In Key Stats\n\nThe eternal debate over basketball’s greatest of all time frequently narrows down to two luminaries: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Jordan, with his six championship rings, epitomized dominance in the ’90s, setting a virtually unparalleled standard.\n\nMeanwhile, LeBron’s unique blend of athleticism and versatility redefines what prolonged excellence looks like in the NBA.  Both icons have built near-impenetrable legacies.\n\nSo, if we delve into the numbers—championships, MVPs, and more—who truly claims the record books?\n\nNBA Championships\n\nLeBron’s quartet of championships highlights his exceptional ability to adapt and lead, having clinched titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers.  Yet, the lingering narrative of his 4-6 NBA Finals record points to the struggles he faced in securing wins when the stakes were at their highest.\n\nOn the flip side, Jordan’s six-for-six in Finals appearances with the Bulls remains the gold standard.  His undefeated Finals record stands as a monument to his peerless capacity to deliver during basketball’s most crucial moments.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-1\n\nFinals MVPs\n\nHere, LeBron’s talent for taking center stage during the NBA’s grandest series shines through, with noteworthy performances like his near triple-double series in 2016. Yet, for Jordan, every championship came paired with a Finals MVP—showcasing time and again his ability to outshine all competitors on the brightest stage.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-2\n\nRegular Season MVPs\n\nLeBron’s run of MVPs underscores his all-around impact and consistent brilliance, although he frequently found himself snubbed perhaps due to voter fatigue. For Jordan, five MVP accolades marked his reign as the unequivocal king of two Chicago Bulls dynasties, reinforcing his long-held status as the best in the league.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-3\n\nScoring Titles\n\nWhile LeBron excels as a scorer, his focus on all-around play resulted in just one scoring title. Though, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer didn’t require him to lead the league every year. Jordan, however, amassed ten scoring titles, with seven consecutive at his zenith, cementing his status as an unparalleled offensive juggernaut.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-4\n\nAssist Titles\n\nShowcasing his playmaking prowess, LeBron led the league in assists in 2020, illustrating his capability to quarterback an entire offense. Jordan’s role rarely required him to serve as the principal facilitator, although he remained adept in creating plays when necessary.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 1-4\n\nAll-NBA Selections\n\nLeBron’s 20 selections not only reflect his rarefied skill but also underscore his longevity. Remaining one of the top players over two decades is an unprecedented accomplishment. Meanwhile, Jordan’s 11 honors, achieved in a shorter span, were packed with exceptional dominance, each season testimony to his status as the league’s premier player.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 2-4\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\nLeBron’s 21 All-Star appearances further emphasize his enduring relevance and adaptability amidst evolving league dynamics. Jordan’s 14 All-Star nods, though fewer, affirm his perennial impact, with court performances that turned the exhibition into prime-time must-watch events.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 3-4\n\nAll-Star Game MVPs\n\nIn the spotlight of All-Star weekend, both icons displayed their exceptional skills, each capturing three MVP titles. LeBron dazzled with flair and dominance while remaining a crowd-pleaser. Jordan approached these games with a competitive spirit, famously engaging in a memorable clash with Kobe Bryant in 1998.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-5\n\nAll-Defensive Team Selections\n\nWhile LeBron has been formidable defensively during stretches, especially in Miami, his collective accolades don’t rival his offensive feats. Jordan’s defense was relentless, earning him nine First Team selections and reinforcing his all-around excellence.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-6\n\nDefensive Player of the Year Awards\n\nDefensive dominance is epitomized by Jordan’s 1988 DPOY award, a year in which he also led the league in scoring. It remains one of the most remarkable dual achievements in NBA history.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-7\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nBoth athletes burst onto the scene, immediately transforming their teams. LeBron’s debut season hinted at greatness as he elevated a lackluster Cavaliers squad, while Jordan’s 28.2 points per game as a rookie previewed the prolific scorer he would become.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 5-8\n\nTotal Win Shares\n\nIn terms of win shares, LeBron’s substantial total illustrates his long-term influence on team success, with his versatile skill set contributing to victory over a prolonged career. Jordan, while behind in total count, boasted immense per-season impact amplified by his legendary playoff performances.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-8\n\nCareer Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\n\nLeBron’s exceptional PER underscores his comprehensive performance levels across every statistical measure. Yet Jordan’s slight edge in this metric highlights his superior efficiency during fewer seasons, a testament to his unparalleled dominance.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-9\n\nNBA Cup Titles\n\nLeBron etched his name once more into the history books by securing the first-ever NBA Cup, adding another facet to his illustrious career.\n\nIn the expansive realm of basketball debate, the ledger leans towards Jordan. However, this ongoing discourse reminds us how each titan has left an indelible mark on the game, and, perhaps, greatness can indeed wear different forms.\n\nLatest Miami Heat News & Rumors To Your Inbox\n\nStart your day with latest Miami Heat news and rumors in your inbox.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James Vs Michael Jordan: Who Was the Better Defender Between the Two GOAT Candidates?\n\nShubham Singh|PublishedJan 30, 2024\n\nCredits- USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA community is obsessed with the GOAT debate. Usually, the choice boils down to the two NBA legends, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Since most fans are generally interested in the two players’ contributions on the offensive end, their extraordinary defensive contributions can be often overlooked. Therefore, one interesting way of looking into the GOAT debate can be by examining Jordan and LeBron’s defensive numbers and accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo simplify the arguments, one can deploy the usage of defensive win shares and defensive rating as the predominant stats. Defensive win shares is an advanced stat that requires complex calculations. This thorough indicator takes into account the minutes played by the player and the team, league points per possession, defensive rating, and a bunch of other stats that provide a condensed fraction. Simply speaking, the higher a player’s defensive win shares, the more contributions a player has made defensively to the team.\n\nConversely, when it comes to defensive rating, a lower number is desirable. The defensive rating is measured by how many points a player allows per 100 possessions. Let us take a look at how LeBron James and Michael Jordan do in these two categories and present an overview of their defensive accolades.\n\nLeBron James\n\nJames has always been a prime-time defender. His defense peaked during his late Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat days. He made the first All-NBA Defensive Teams from 2009 to 2013. In fact, in 2008-09, the Cavs Forward finished second to 3x DPOY Dwight Howard in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. While in the 2012-13 season, another Center Marc Gasol nabbed the award from the Heat’s Two-Way phenom as he finished with 18 votes compared to Gasol’s 31. In 2014, LeBron made his last All-NBA defensive team when he was selected to the second team.\n\nIn terms of All-Time Defensive Win Shares, James is 11th on the list with 79.88 DWS. His defensive rating is placed at an impressive 104.4, just above his former Lakers teammate Dwight Howard. For his career, the four-time NBA Champion has captured around 1.5 steals per game. His best season was his sophomore season when he clinched 2.2 steals per game.\n\nAs a premier shot-blocker, James has notched 0.7 blocks per game, going over 1 block a game four times. His chase-down blocks are revered across generations. His block against Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals that denied the Warriors a lead remains one of the most historic ones ever.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan is one of the best perimeter defenders to play the game. MJ made 9X All-NBA Defensive Teams and even won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1988. In terms of Defensive Win Shares, Jordan is 21st All-Time with 64.13. The Guard had a defensive rating of 102.7. He was the league’s steals leader thrice in his career.\n\nMJ finished his career, notching an impressive 2.3 steals per game and is fourth all-time in the steals-per-game department. The six-time NBA Champion was also an impressive shot-blocker, finishing with 0.8 blocks a game. He blocked more than a shot per game four times in his career.\n\nOne of the most iconic blocks for MJ came when he was with the Wizards. The Shooting Guard with massive hands had plucked the ball away from Bulls’ Ron Mercer while he was attempting a layup. It was as if the veteran guard snatched a rebound away from a player attempting the shot.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese comparisons again can’t make an objective argument for which player is a better defender. Even though some might give Jordan the edge, they have different profiles. Jordan was more of an on-ball defender but was equally adept at helping from the weak side. Meanwhile, James is one of the best help defenders while equally threatening in one-on-one situations. Both players have been among the best competitors so it is natural that their defense was top-notch. At any rate, this defensive comparison won’t move the needle in the GOAT debate. The more people talk about it, the muddier the water gets.\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level. It quite literally does not get better than that.\nNBA POSITIONAL RANKINGS: PG | SG | SF | PF | C\nLeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Regular season stats\nJames' longevity gives him the edge in total statistics but Jordan holds the edge in scoring average.

Cleveland jumped out to a 31-11 lead after the first quarter and won by 15 points to set up a Game 7 for the ages.\n-- Dave McMenamin\n2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 42.0\n2021 Finals: Game 6 vs. Phoenix Suns\nWith the Bucks one win away from winning their first NBA title in 50 years, all it took was Antetokounmpo having one of the greatest games in Finals history to end their drought.\nAntetokounmpo finished with 50 points on 16-for-25 shooting from the field to go along with 14 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 blocks was one thing. But for him to also go 17-for-19 from the free throw line, after all of the chatter about his foul shooting during the postseason, was the definition of rising to meet the moment.\nAnd, as a result, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks were able to celebrate a championship on their home floor in Milwaukee.\n-- Tim Bontemps\n3. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 42.0\n2020 Finals: Game 3 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\nButler carried the Heat throughout their time in the 2020 Orlando, Florida, Bubble, but never more so than in Game 3 of the Finals against James and the Lakers. Butler scored 40 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a win that not only kept the Heat in the series, but further cemented his status as one of the game's premiere playoff players. Butler played 45 minutes, leaving everything he had on the floor while making big play after big play all night.\n-- Nick Friedell\n4. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 41.3\n\nJimmy Butler left it all on the court in the 2020 Finals. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\nWith his team's season hanging in the balance in the bubble, Butler delivered another all-time performance to the tune of 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a Game 5 victory over the Lakers. Butler knew he had to set a tone for the rest of his teammates and that's exactly what he did, following up his Game 3 showcase with another game that will be remembered within the Heat organization for years. Aside from Butler's ability to make big plays all over the floor, the picture of an exhausted Butler from this game remains one of the most memed in history.\n-- Friedell\n5. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 41.3\n2018 Finals: Game 1 vs. Golden State Warriors\nIn the greatest game of James' individual postseason run, the star forward became just the fifth player in league history to top 50 points in an NBA Finals game, joining Elgin Baylor (61), Michael Jordan (55), Rick Barry (55) and Jerry West (53) with 51 points. He also had 8 rebounds and 8 assists, all against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. The masterful performance still wasn't enough to get a win, as the Warriors prevailed in overtime with two crucial sequences going against the Cavs. First, James was called for a blocking foul on Kevin Durant with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two. Had it been a charge, maybe things would have been different. And second, in one of the most memed moments of James' career, JR Smith dribbled out the clock when George Hill missed a free throw with four seconds left with the score tied, rather than go for the go-ahead bucket near the hoop, causing James to splay his arms toward his teammate in exasperation.\n-- McMenamin\n6. Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs | Game score: 40.8\n2003 Finals: Game 6 vs. New Jersey Nets\nDuncan set the tone for the Spurs' Finals defeat of the Nets with an all-time box-score stuffing performance in the series opener: 32 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, 7 blocks and 3 steals. It was the most blocks and steals ever recorded in a 30-20 Finals outing and the third-most assists. Duncan was almost as dominant in the closeout Game 6, putting up a 21-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist, 8-block line to clinch his second Finals MVP.\n-- Tim MacMahon\n7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 39.8\n2018 Finals: Game 3 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers\nAny time the Warriors needed a big play in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers, Durant delivered. He had 43 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists, but it was a clutch 3-pointer over two Cavs defenders with 52 seconds left that sealed both the game and his place in Finals history. An all-time dagger from an all-time player. Durant would go on to win his second straight Finals MVP and lead the Warriors to their second consecutive title.\n-- Friedell\n8. Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.6\n1980 Finals: Game 6 vs. Philadelphia 76ers\nTop stories of the week from \nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• Best men's hoops games on every day »\n• Premier League: 25 best/worst at skills »\n• NBA: 7 lottery teams and their futures »\nMore ESPN+ content »\nJohnson, who was a year removed from leading Michigan State to the NCAA title, stepped into the starting center role for the Finals closeout game with legendary big man Kareem Abdul-Jabbar staying in Los Angeles to nurse a badly sprained ankle. \"Never fear, Magic is here!\" Johnson told his teammates as they boarded the flight to Philadelphia. Johnson delivered the best Finals performance ever by a rookie, scoring 42 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and dishing out 7 assists to lead the Lakers to the first of their five championships in the Showtime era.\n-- MacMahon\n9. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 39.2\n2016 Finals: Game 5 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\"What did you say Klay [Thompson] said?\" James asked a reporter prior to Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals. \"Klay said, 'I guess he just got his feelings hurt,'\" the reporter replied, detailing Thompson's response to James' run-in with Draymond Green in Game 4. Then James burst out an indulgent chuckle. It was the start of the most significant postseason stretch of his career, winning Games 5 through 7 to help the Cavaliers become the first team in Finals history to climb out of a 3-1 deficit and win. James was brilliant in Game 5, putting up 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks as he and Kyrie Irving became the first pair of teammates to ever drop 40-plus in the same Finals game. The comeback was on.\n-- McMenamin\n10. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.1\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Miami Heat\nMuch like the Smith game in the 2018 Finals, James' brilliance in Game 5 of the 2020 Finals sometimes gets forgotten, because of the attention paid to Danny Green's potential game-winning 3-pointer from the top of the key missing with under 10 seconds remaining. But the fact that James nearly closed out the bubble by making 15 out of 21 shots -- including 6-of-9 3s -- to score 40 points with 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals while wearing the \"Black Mamba\" uniform that held so much significance to the Lakers' franchise that season in remembering Kobe Bryant makes it one of the finest playoff games of James' or any other player's career.\n-- McMenamin\n11. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls | Game score: 38.9\n\nEven by his standards, Michael Jordan was unstoppable in Game 4 of the '93 Finals. Manny Millan /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n1993 Finals: Game 4 vs. Phoenix Suns\nJordan scored nearly half of the Bulls' points with a 55-point outburst in Game 4 of the 1993 Finals. It was one of the highest scoring performances in Finals history and put the Bulls on the verge of their first three-peat.\nChicago won the first two games of the series on the road before dropping Game 3 after returning home, but Jordan would not allow the Suns back into the series. Phoenix had no answer in stopping him from getting to the rim and Jordan shot 56.8% from the field with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. Jordan's 55 points are tied for the second-most in Finals history, trailing only a 61-point game by Baylor in 1962.\n-- Jamal Collier\n12. Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 37.9\n2000 Finals: Game 1 vs. Indiana Pacers\nShaq's 2000 series against Indiana was one of the most dominant Finals ever, as he averaged 38.0 PPG to rank third in Finals history behind Jordan in 1993 (41.0) and Baylor in 1962 (40.6). Fresh off a Game 7 comeback to beat the Portland Trail Blazers, O'Neal served the Pacers notice in the series opener at the then-Staples Center, putting up 41 points on 21-of-31 shooting and 19 rebounds as the Lakers pulled away late. The 21 field goals were one shy of Baylor's 1962 Finals record, which came on 15 more shot attempts.\n-- Pelton\n13. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 37.4\n2021 Finals: Game 3 vs. Phoenix Suns\nWhen the Bucks returned home from Phoenix down 2-0 in the Finals, it looked like their storybook season would wind up being anything but.\nThat's where Antetokounmpo came in. With a loss all but certain to end Milwaukee's season, Antetokounmpo made sure that would not happen, going for 41 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists in just under 38 minutes, while also going -- in a precursor to his truly legendary performance in Game 6 -- 13-for-17 from the foul line. It wound up being the first of four straight wins for the Bucks in the series, as Milwaukee would go on to win its first title since 1971.\n-- Bontemps\n14. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 37.2\n\nStephen Curry's heroics couldn't lead the Warriors to a victory in Game 3 of the 2019 NBA Finals. Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images\n2019 Finals: Game 3 vs. Toronto Raptors\nThe barrage of shots from all over the floor started early in a Game 3 loss to the Raptors as Curry carried an offense playing without star forward Durant, who was out because of an Achilles injury. While he couldn't carry the Warriors to a victory, Curry hit six 3-pointers and scored 47 points, giving Warriors fans one last show in Oracle Arena before the team moved to Chase Center after the season. While Curry's performance was a highlight for the Warriors, this series will always be remembered by Durant's Achilles tear in Game 5 and Klay Thompson's ACL tear in Game 6.\n-- Friedell\n15. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns | Game score: 37.0\n1993 Finals: Game 2 vs. Chicago Bulls\nAfter a subpar Game 1, where he posted 21 points on 9-of-25 shooting as the Bulls won the opener in Phoenix, Barkley bounced back with his best game of the 1993 Finals: 42 points on 16-of-26 shooting, plus 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Only one problem: Jordan also scored 42 points, coming within an assist of a triple-double. While Barkley got the edge in game score by virtue of his efficiency, Jordan's Chicago team earned the 111-108 win, taking a 2-0 lead in a series they would go on to win in six games.\n-- Pelton\nThe best of the rest\n16. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls, 1992 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 36.9\n17. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks, 2021 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 36.7\n18.

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nRanking the Greatest NBA Finals Performances in Losing Efforts Since 2000\n\nAs much as we hope to see greatness rewarded, that simply does not always happen in the NBA Finals.\n\nIn recent memory, a prime example is LeBron James during the 2015 NBA Finals. He paced all scorers in five of the six games, but his injury-plagued Cleveland Cavaliers could not keep up with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nFive other instances stand out since the 2000 NBA Finals.\n\nHistorically, the losing team's top player is not recognized for his efforts. Only once—Jerry West in 1969—has an individual from the runner-up still earned the MVP honor. But the following group has a few players who demanded that level of respect in the last 20-plus years.\n\nThe list is subjective but focuses on individual production and considers both series length and context.\n\nIn the moment, perhaps you didn't have a lot of sympathy for Stephen Curry. After all, the Golden State Warriors had made the NBA Finals for a fifth consecutive season and previously won three titles.\n\nBut as a star-studded roster crumbled around him, Curry did as much as possible to keep the Dubs in contention.\n\nGolden State lost Kevin Durant to an Achilles injury in Game 1 and Klay Thompson to a torn left ACL in Game 5.\n\nCurry averaged 30.5 points, 6.0 assists and 5.2 rebounds in the series. Along with maxing out at 47 points—then the highest total of his playoff career—in Game 3, he drilled a clutch late-game triple to help the Warriors win Game 4.\n\nHowever, the Kawhi Leonard-led Toronto Raptors dispatched the banged-up Warriors in six games.\n\nThe next two players share a common trait: They excelled in a Finals loss to LeBron-led opposition.\n\nDurant tallied 25-plus points in all five clashes with the Heat, opening the series by scoring 36 points in an OKC victory. Unfortunately for the Thunder, that would be their lone win of the series.\n\nNevertheless, the 23-year-old Durant had a memorable five-game run. He averaged 30.6 points with a 54.8 percent shooting mark, hitting 39.4 percent of his 6.6 long-range attempts per game.\n\nLeBron secured MVP honors and his first-ever championship, but KD left a strong impression in his Finals debut.\n\nSince joining the Miami Heat in 2020, Jimmy Butler has unleashed an incredible alter ego: Playoff Jimmy.\n\nThe legend began in the bubble, peaking opposite the Los Angeles Lakers during the NBA Finals. Butler had 22-plus points in the first five contests, including a 40-point explosion with a triple-double in Game 3.\n\nAs if that's not enough, the Heat won Game 5 thanks to his 35-point triple-double—with a handful of steals, too.\n\nButler wrapped up the series with 26.2 points per game on 55.2 percent shooting, adding 9.8 assists and 8.2 rebounds. Miami bowed out to LeBron and the Lakers in six games, though.\n\nFrom a narrative perspective, it's a shame that one of Allen Iverson's most iconic highlights preceded a series loss.\n\nBut this moment has endured for decades.\n\nThe opening game of the 2001 Finals between the Philadelphia 76ers and Lakers went to overtime. Iverson sealed the Philly victory with a step-back jumper and disrespectful—in the best way—step over Tyronn Lue.\n\nIverson, who scored 48 points, also contributed six assists and five steals on that memorable night.\n\nSimilar to Durant, the disappointing reality is AI and the Sixers could not manage another win. Nevertheless, he poured in 35.6 points and 3.8 assists per game.\n\nDurant and Butler found themselves on the wrong end of a series against The King. LeBron, however, is not immune to a stellar individual series not being enough for a ring.\n\nIn 2017, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Warriors squared off in a third straight NBA Finals. But the Warriors added Kevin Durant in the prior offseason and cruised to a championship. They jumped out to a 3-0 series lead and sealed the title in a relatively comfortable Game 5.\n\nJames made history anyway.\n\nDespite the runner-up finish, he became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals. LeBron recorded 33.6 points, 12.0 rebound and 10.0 assists per game, shooting 55.6 percent from the floor.\n\nMost remarkably, it's hardly even a discussion this performance in 2017 is behind his showing in 2015.\n\nYou could've given him the MVP in 2015.\n\nSure, the Warriors took the series. LeBron absolutely was the best player, though. He scored a game-high total in five of the six outings—and ended two assists shy of a triple-double in the one contest he did not.\n\nCleveland only had Kyrie Irving for a game, and Kevin Love didn't play a minute. James responded to their absences in tremendous fashion, netting 39-plus points in Games 1-3. He tallied a 40-point triple-double in Game 5 and racked up 32 points, 18 rebounds and nine assists in the series-ending Game 6 loss.\n\nJames averaged a hugely impressive 35.8 points with 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game.\n\nThe next season, he'd lead the Cavaliers to a long-awaited ring.\n\n"

These matchups featured superstars pushing their limits, delivering incredible performances, and creating lasting memories for fans.\n\nFrom legendary rivalries to unexpected showdowns, these intense duels were defined by skill, determination, and a desire to dominate. Whether it was a clash between all-time greats or a rising star challenging an established icon, these encounters kept spectators on the edge of their seats. Some games turned into scoring duels, while others became defensive showcases, but all left a lasting impact on the sport.\n\nTop 5 One-On-One Duels In The NBA\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Larry Bird\n\nMichael Jordan’s rise to greatness saw him face off against Larry Bird, the dominant star of the 1980s. While Bird secured three championships, Jordan was proving himself to be an unstoppable force despite a weaker supporting cast. In their 28 matchups, Jordan outscored Bird on average (33.5 to 26.9 points per game), but Bird’s Celtics won 17 times.\n\nTheir first meeting in 1984 saw Jordan outscore Bird 27-14, and he did it again a month later, 32-10. Despite Boston’s frequent victories, Jordan consistently delivered standout performances, including 41 points, 12 rebounds, and seven assists in a 1985 loss.\n\nThere are some moments in NBA that are just a little more special.

In a time where just one division of athletic programs is a “$6 billion enterprise,” (Desrochers 2013) it’s no wonder that a great amount of money is spent every year in an attempt to increase performance. Athletic departments spend far more – three to six times as much – on athletes than the institutions do to educate average students, with schools in one athletic conference spending an average 12.2 times more ($163,931 compared to $13,390). With all this money being spent, and with at least 92 different sports science journals currently active since 2010 (Journal Ranking 2010) it would be odd to think that there was a simple method of improving sports performance that researchers and collegiate sports programs are overlooking. However, the use of in-game contact as a method to lead to greater success in sports seems to be currently unnoticed.\n\nThe use of touch as a performance indicator for basketball is not an area of sports and movement science that has received much attention. Kraus et al. 2010, which explored this specific connection between touch and performance concluded that “touch is crucial for predicting performance in competitive group settings” and that “teams that went on to enjoy winning records directly following the coded game engaged in more touch (M = 23.79) than teams with losing records after the coded game (M = 16.14)” where the difference in touch was measured in seconds (Kraus et al. 2010). However, most studies, such as Rajan 2009, focus on the effects of nonverbal communication as a whole rather than individual mediums, and though nonverbal communication has been proven to increase confidence and camaraderie between team members, these results are not specific enough to identify the exact causes of increased performance. In our study, we are focusing solely on the effects of touch between members of collegiate basketball teams to see if there is a link the amount of contact and the amount of success teams have.\n\nTouch has the ability to influence and infer many things, from thoughts and perceptions to feelings of trust (Hertenstein 2002, Williams & Bargh 2008). Trust has been cited as an indicator of increased commitment between people and can increase a person’s ability to depend on others when necessary (Wieselquist et al. 1999), which is vital in sports; this is especially true in team sports such as basketball where the ability to depend on other players for constructing plays and throwing passes the game is played and won. Team cohesion positively influences overall performance, especially in team sports where teammates depend on one another for success (Jones & Kijeski 2009). Thus, there is a clear line of logic that connects touch to various avenues of increased success.\n\nThe goal of our research was to see if greater amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team led to greater success of the team in terms of score and number of wins. This was be measured by watching publicly available archived footage of 10 Salem State University home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist, the various forms the in-game contact takes and how often it occurs for both teams. We hypothesized that greater in-game contact between teammates does lead to greater success in basketball.\n\nThe results of this study provide insight into the effects of non-verbal communication and motivation among sports team members. The results could be given to basketball teams or adopted for other sports in order to achieve greater success; the possibilities for the implementation of these results are legion. Teams that go out of their way to make more contact may not only find greater performance on the court but may also feel better about their fellow players and themselves.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nDoes more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nBasketball is a team sport that requires teammates to possess a collaborative skill set. Team cohesion is developed as a result of collaborative efforts between teammates participating in an interactive sport such as basketball. Both verbal and non-verbal communication within an interactive sports team setting inspires confidence and motivation among teammates, further enhancing team cohesion. A mutually supportive, interactive team environment where encouragement is communicated by teammates both verbally and non-verbally through physical touch, promotes cooperation leading to improved performance and team success.\n\nIn a business environment, individuals are often grouped into teams to work on collaborative projects without having first developed or practiced collaborative skills. (Snyder, 2009) The absence of collaborative skills leads the individuals on the team to apply individual approaches to a group experience. This of course would defeat the purpose of being grouped into a team and could potentially lead to conflict within the group as varying individual approaches can either jeopardize the project or exclude other group members. Instructing teams about teamwork provides participants with the tools to perform well within a collaborative setting.\n\nA great deal of effort is often put into preparation and practice to improve individual skills and performance. In addition, individuals require safe environments in which they can practice communication skills prior to performance and evaluation. A safe environment would also include a setting where team membership would remain consistent from practice to performance. If individuals are prepared and practice their team skills, they are more likely to effectively apply their skills in group assignments. In order to practice and model effective collaboration; attention was focused on the purpose of the project, participation and positive collaboration was encouraged, timelines were established, the projects were kept on track and conflicts were negotiated.\n\nIndividuals were given the opportunity to review and revise their collaborative performance through a questionnaire which upon reflection allowed them to be more effective team members. Self reflection is a method of performance evaluation that can provide valuable perspectives. Specific questions were used to help students review and reflect on their performance: After students have a foundational understanding of the collaborative skills, they practice these skills in a collaborative, yet supportive, environment. (Snyder, 2009) The focus on preparation, practice and performance review in teaching teams about teamwork was effective in developing and improving collaborative skills resulting in a positive group experience.\n\nCollaboration is essential to success as it allows a group of individuals to aspire and work towards a common goal. A major part of the collaborative process is communication which can be relayed in many different forms. When all members of a group are collaborating on a project or task and are communicating effectively, efficiency towards goal accomplishment is heightened. Cohesion is displayed within a group setting when the grouped individuals are able to work towards a common goal while communicating effectively. Coactive settings require individuals to take on all the responsibilities and approach tasks without seeking collaboration. Interactive settings require individuals to collaborate with each other to accomplish tasks through communication and this cohesion often leads to success.\n\nThe existence of a relationship between group cohesion and success is explored when both task and social cohesion deal with member-to-member relations within a team environment. (Jones & Kijeski, 2009) Group cohesion applies to social structure within a group, social exchanges between members in the group, role clarity and commitment to the group, common goals between group members, and the relationship of the above to task performance. Interactive team sports such as soccer, basketball, football where members only competed for the good of the team and only received a team score for their efforts exhibited the strongest relationship between team cohesion and team success. Coactive or individual sports such as golf, tennis and gymnastics where athletes can succeed with or without their team, performance is not entirely dependent on team cohesion.\n\nThe purpose of the research was to determine if there was a positive relationship between team cohesion and team success in coactive sports. The research further sought to determine if team cohesion correlates with team performance to a greater degree among teams competing in interactive team sports than among teams competing in coactive team sports. Surveys were used to collect data from a sample of athletes competing on both interactive and coactive sports teams. The sample was collected by administering surveys to the athletes just prior to scheduled practice times, with the prior knowledge and approval of the coaching staff of each team. Task team cohesion and social team cohesion were individually examined to determine if one influences team success more. Team success was defined as the winning percentage of each team in the study and was measured using the publicly available data win/loss records.\n\nThe research study found that team cohesion influences overall success differently between interactive and coactive sports. The findings supported a negative correlation between team cohesion and team success between coactive sports teams and a positive correlation among interactive sports teams. The results are indicative of differences between coactive and interactive sports where coactive athletes are recognized for individual achievements and success. There is less emphasis on recognition of an athlete’s individual achievement and success in interactive sports. Cohesion among athletes may be hindered by inter-team competition in coactive sports as athletes from the same team often compete against each other.\n\nIn coactive settings that require individuals to take on tasks and challenges without the support of others the development of communication and collaborative skills is limited. Coactive individuals are not only faced with the tasks at hand but must also be self confident and motivated to proceed. Interactive settings automatically present a support system where individuals can rely upon each other to work together towards task accomplishment. Individuals grouped together in an interactive situation provide encouragement, confidence and motivation as part of the collaborative process. This support which goes beyond communication and collaborative skills is essential to success and further promotes cohesion within the group.\n\nThere is a relationship between language usage in spectator sports and how the nonverbal works in increasing the solidarity of team members and admirers. (Rajan, 2009) Stating that sports psychology can be considered as an applied science, the author explains the way psychology is working in the field of sports and training. There are many metaphors that are used in sports that compare it to war; this is especially evident when an athlete trains with the discipline of a soldier in preparation for competition. Athlete uniforms take the place of soldier armor and terms such as win, defeat and battlefield take on the same meaning as they would in a combat warzone. Nonverbal communication increases the confidence and solidarity of team members to perform cohesively leading to a successful outcome.\n\nThe extremely competitive nature of sports requires intense motivation, preparation and practice to achieve a desired level of performance. Beyond physical preparation as an aid to success, athletes need to be mentally prepared and confident in their ability to perform during competition. Sports and exercise psychology has evolved as an interdisciplinary field involving sports psychologists’ use psychological assessment techniques and intervention strategies in an effort to help individuals to achieve their optimal physical performance by focusing on the mental aspects of performance. Psychology as a behavioral science has made its contribution towards improving sports performance by helping coaches to coach more athletes to perform efficiently and enhance athletic performance by reducing stress.\n\nAnxiety can be a deterrent that impedes athletes from achieving success by hampering their decision making ability. Regardless of individual skill level, anxiety has been found to exert a powerful influence on athlete performance in sports. The most powerful quality that elite athletes posses, is a high level self-confidence which may act as a protective shield from anxiety. Success in sports depends on trust in your own strength and ability this is especially important in coactive sports. If an athlete is well prepared for competition from the physical, technical and tactical point of view, the most important factor deciding about his/ her degree of success is self confidence. In an interactive sports team environment, team cohesion promotes athlete confidence as teammates provide encouragement and motivation through trust in their combined ability to achieve success.\n\nThe encouragement and support necessary to provide confidence and motivation to individuals within an interactive setting is a driving force for success. It is through verbal and nonverbal displays that this support is communicated among individuals within a group and trust is established. This mutually supportive approach that establishes trust within an interactive group setting further enhances cohesion and collaboration. The absence of collaboration in an individual approach to task accomplishment is characteristic of a coactive setting where there is a strong emphasis on competition. An interactive approach emphasizes mutual empowerment and team building which provides the foundation for success through encouragement and support.\n\nThere is a connection between an individual’s first experience and their first opportunity to tap into their\ncompetitive drive as self-motivation. (Way, 2009) Exposure to competition allows individuals and team members to become aware of their skills and abilities. In addition to this awareness, individuals and team members are faced with the need to develop techniques that address the resulting emotions which range from pride to disappointment. By deemphasizing competition in favor of a mutually supportive approach, individuals and teams develop strength, trust and cohesion through a framework of cooperation and teamwork which leads to success.\n\nThe research paper provides a case study of a girls running team that emphasizes competition as a secondary objective in favor of a mutually supportive and team oriented approach. The primary goal for the running team is to develop self awareness of skills and abilities while developing strength and motivation through a framework of cooperative teamwork. Through outward displays of praise and recognition for their efforts, the coaches instruct the girls to support and encourage their teammates. The need for developing techniques to channel the emotions associated with competition which ranges from pride to disappointment are not addressed by the coaches. Outward displays of praise and motivation within a cohesive team oriented environment incorporate the use of emotion in relaying a mutually supportive approach among individuals and teams.\n\nThe research study found that the practice teammates encouraging each other for their accomplishments- even when the accomplishments are not about supporting others, could lead to mutual empowerment and team building. (Way, 2009) Greater recognition of teammates’ contributions to organizational team success can be achieved through acknowledgement and pride in individual accomplishments. By emphasizing goal setting over competition allows individuals to examine their performance and develop strategies on how to improve while keeping the mutual focus on team success. Outward displays of praise and motivation that are driven by emotion which can take the form of excitement or frustration present individuals with the opportunity to channel those feelings towards fuelling team progress.\n\nThe mutually supportive approach that deemphasizes competition in favor of teams developing strength, trust and cohesion through a framework of cooperation and teamwork leads to success. Physical touch is a nonverbal form of communication characteristic of interactive settings that can transmit feelings of trust, encouragement and support. Emotions that range from pride to disappointment can be relayed both verbally and nonverbally; however, it is through outward displays of praise and recognition for their efforts, that support and encouragement is relayed among teammates. When the outward displays among teammates in an interactive setting take the form of physical touch, it results in an increase of individual and group performance.\n\nTactile communication, or physical touch, promotes cooperation between people, communicates distinct emotions, soothes in times of stress, and is used to make inferences of warmth and trust. (Kraus et al. 2010) The researchers predicted that physical touch in group competition contributes to increased individual and group performance. Teamwork and cooperative behaviors between teammates further explained the association between touch and team performance in the National Basketball Association. As the most highly developed sense at birth, touch in human beings promotes and communicates trust, cooperative bonds and group functioning. In interactive team sports such as basketball, touch is used to convey support, praise and recognition for individual efforts while contributing to a cohesive team environment.\n\nThe researchers tested two hypotheses, there was the expectation that touch early in the basketball season to influence both individual and team performance later on in the season. They reasoned that better group performances are achieved as a result of increased cooperative behaviors brought about by the association between touch and trust. The second expectation was that cooperative behaviors between teammates would be enhanced and lead to improved team performance in competition. The extent to which teammates engaged in cooperative behaviors is mediated by the association between touch and performance where increased touch between teammates would contribute to greater performance. The tactile behavior of 294 players from all 30 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams was coded for physical touch and cooperation during one game played within the first two months of the start of the 2008-2009 NBA regular season.\n\nThe researchers found that performance in competitive group settings is enhanced by physical touch as demonstrated by teams during NBA games. Touch was also associated with higher performance at the individual and group level. In analyzing the cooperative functions of touch, the study showed that touch is a contributing factor to performance through promoting trust and cooperation between teammates. In conveying praise and recognition for teammate’s efforts, touch is used to communicate support and encouragement which enhances group performance through building cooperation. It is suggested that because touch may promote group functioning during competition by enhancing cooperation and performance, touch interventions could be used to promote relationships between students and teachers, or to strengthen bonds between romantic partners. In addition, certain forms of touch that are associated with elevated status may help individuals ascend status hierarchies within team settings and promote further cohesion.\n\nTouch amongst players on sports teams is one of the most common and beneficial forms of non-verbal communication between teammates, especially basketball. Mainly occurring in celebration of a positive play, examples of touch include “fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles” (Kraus et al. 2010). Through its ability to transmit information and feelings among players, touch increases cooperation and trust between them as well and increases in trust, most notably, translate to increases in sports performance.\n\nTouch has the ability to improve group coordination and harmonization due to its ability to convey “perceptions, thoughts, and/or feelings” (Hertenstein 2002). Thus, if one teammate wanted to congratulate another on a good play or wanted another player to understand what they were thinking or feeling, touch would be an effective medium of communication. This communication often occurs after one teammate has done something worth congratulation, such as a good point or a successful play.\n\nThe repeated use of touch for these situations, however, may lead some to think that the value of touch for the receiver may diminish. It is an understandable conclusion – if the use of touch becomes almost autonomous among players after a point is scored or a play made, is there truly any feeling to be received? In a word: yes. Even if the person giving the touch is simply going through the motions of it, it can still be meaningful to the person receiving it. The giver of the touch “may not be mindful that they are providing tactile stimulation…for communication to occur” (Hertenstein 2002).\n\nAdditionally, Hertenstein notes that if touch is consistently used in a similar situation (again, such as in the case of a good pass or difficult shot pulled off), then it will be associated with the feelings that accompany that situation; “memory for the particular context of tactile experiences likely influences the meaning of a given stimulus” (2002). Thus, since basketball players consistently employ touch in beneficial situations to them, the player receiving the celebratory touch will come to associate touch with good feelings and success.\n\nTouch has traditionally been found to increase and strengthen cooperation. For example, in one economic game where the goal of the research was to determine if various forms of non-verbal communication caused an increase in cooperation and create relationships between originally separated players, it was established that “being touched is a cue that one is in a close social relationship with the person touching,” and a great deal of “evidence exists that touch can increase cooperation” (Kurzban 2001). These two cues signify the ability of touch to enhanced closeness and, perhaps more importantly, create trust among teammates.\n\nTouch creates and improves trust, which is key in promoting increased performance for sports teams. Williams and Bargh explored how trust was created through short tactile sensations of warmth, similar to the kind that can be produced by the quick touches between basketball players. They first looked at the brain, noting that the insular cortex, which is responsible for “processing both the physical and the psychological versions of warmth information…is also involved in feelings of trust, empathy, and social emotions” (2008). Then, in a study which used a cup of hot coffee as a quick warmth stimulus, found that “people who had briefly held the hot coffee cup perceived the target person as being significantly warmer” (where interpersonal warmth is defined as trust). Thus, “a brief warm or cold physical experience influenced participants’ subsequent interpersonal judgments of a target person” (2008). Not only did the warm cup of coffee – which again can be associated with the warm touch of a teammate – create a quick sensation of trust between two people, it created a long-lasting feeling of trust.\n\nFollowing the results of this study, it can be concluded that touch between teammates would also improve the trust between them. Trust has been noted to improve commitment between people and increase a person’s ability to depend on others when necessary (Wieselquist et al. 1999). This can lead to better strategic plays within the basketball game itself, where players allow themselves to utilize their teammates better. One way this could occur within the game is with passing the ball, especially with an “inside pass” or a pass that occurs within the free-throw line; passing the ball this close to the opposing team’s basketball hoop would require a certain amount of trust from the player passing the ball to the person they pass it to. And after a study done which compared the amount of inside passes to the amount of points scored, “results suggest to consider the inside pass as a performance indicator in basketball” (Courel et al. 2013).\n\nFollowing these studies and the research done, it can concretely be concluded that touch sparks and builds trust. More important, however, is the fact that trust between team mates is an indicator of performance.\n\nIt is a simple, common-sense conclusion, best summed up by this statement: “trust is an integral part of teamwork because team tasks require a high level of interdependence between members” (Mach et al. 2010). You cannot have a sports team that functions in any capacity if they do not trust each other. Without trust, team mates would act independently and performance would suffer greatly compared to those other teams who utilized trust to achieve better performance – such as better plays within the game (see Courel et al. 2013). There is a definite link between “a commitment to the team’s objectives, team performance, and increased coordination and cooperation” (Mach et al. 2010). As Ken Jones puts it, “with trust comes a new attitude that will encourage you to do what you have to do to succeed. Mere reliance will not be motivationally sufficient” (Mach et al. 2010).\n\nOne study was performed where researchers used questionnaires and interviews to determine trust levels between teammates on various professional sports teams (including basketball) and then compared the results to performance; performance was measured by taking the “total points won for every game by each team at the end of the season, [dividing] by the points they could have earned potentially if they had won all their games, then multiplying this ﬁgure by 100.” The results determined that “trust in teammates was positively related to performance measures” (Mach et al. 2010).\n\nIn conclusion, there is a definite line of logic that can be followed regarding touch and its effect on performance. Touch between team mates has the ability to transmit information and good feelings which culminate in trust; touch can also create trust through sensory information – in this case warmth – sent to the brain. This trust then translates into increased performance through enhanced cooperation and commitment.\n\nResearch Question\n\nBased on the relationship between touch, team competition, team relationships and performance thus far, our research hypothesis was that greater in-game contact between teammates leads to greater performance and success in basketball.\n\nMethod\n\nDoes more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nWe sought to determine whether there was a relationship between the amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team over the duration of a season and greater success in their record of winning games. The independent variable, in game-contact, was coded for the Salem State University men’s basketball team and their opponents, the visiting basketball teams, to test our hypotheses. The basketball team’s in-game contact was coded during the home games of the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season. Games were coded and measured for in-game contact by two separate coders by watching publicly available archived footage of home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist of various possible touches derived from a similar study, in-game contact for the two teams competing.\n\nThe coders judged the occurrence of in-game contact of the Salem State University men’s basketball and their opponents. Coders recorded each touch between players and the type of touch. Coding focused on intentional forms of touch; thus, contact resulting directly from playing basketball (e.g., fighting for position, setting screens) was not coded. In addition, due to unreliable camera angles we chose not to code touch during timeouts, or during the end of game quarters. We focused our analysis on twelve distinct types of touch that occurred when two or more players were in the midst of celebrating a positive play that helped their team (e.g., making a shot). These celebratory touches included fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles. (Kraus, Huang & Keltner, 2010) Once our data was compiled, we searched for statistical correlation between touches and performance.\n\n\n\nPerformance and success in basketball can be assessed using a number of indicators but scoring points has typically been considered one of the best ways to measure performance. The dependent variable, greater success in basketball, or more specifically the Salem State University men’s basketball team’s winning record including the scoring totals for home games was compiled for the 2012-2013 season. Scoring totals are a practical measure of performance and success in basketball because they can be calculated using statistics readily available on the Salem State University athletics websites. Conceptually, scoring totals are a valid measure of performance because they measure efficiency in terms of gaining and using possessions, a necessary part of scoring points and winning games.\n\nThere are many other variables that may influence and determine a basketball team’s level of success over the duration of a season while contributing to a winning or losing record. These variables include, but are not limited to, crowd support, player fatigue, skill level of the team, length of season, and team chemistry. Salem Access Television in conjunction with Salem State University is responsible for providing coverage of all the university sporting events including hockey and the recently concluded basketball season. These games are recorded for both the Salem State University sports team coaching staffs and for broadcast on Salem Access Television. For the purpose of the research study, publicly available archived season footage of all the Salem State University men’s basketball home games was obtained from Salem Access Television and reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAfter coding a total of eight of the 2012-2013 men’s college basketball season home games between Salem State and their opponents for in-game contact, number of points scored and their record of winning games we found that Salem State had won seven out of the eight games coded. In each of the eight games, the in-game contact between Salem State teammates exceeded the amount of contact between the teammates on their opponents visiting teams. At face value, these results positively answered our research question- Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\nDue to the many other variables that may influence and determine a basketball teams level of success over the duration of a season while contributing to a winning or losing record. We sought to establish whether there was a correlation between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored for the number of games coded (eight) and the number of teams coded for each game (16).\n\nWhen it comes to Inferential Statistics, The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is measured on a standard scale it can only range between -1.0 and +1.0. As such, we can interpret the correlation coefficient as representing an effect size. It tells us the strength of the relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of .10 is thought to represent a weak or small association; a correlation coefficient of .30 is considered a moderate correlation; and a correlation coefficient of .50 or larger is thought to represent a strong or large correlation. The results of our correlation study (N=16) between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome (0.204637431)\n\nBased on the logic of hypothesis testing, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis- There is no relationship between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored- because the association we found in our study was not statistically significant. In other words: we had not demonstrated that the association we had found was too large to simply have occurred by chance.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study attempted to find a positive connection between the amount of contact a team has between its members and the teams overall performance. Our findings have shown that, while we may not be able to reject our null hypothesis, there may be some connection between the amount of contact and an increase in performance for a basketball team. This result is one which begins to emulate the findings of similar studies (Kraus et. al 2010) and is the natural result of conclusions previously drawn regarding touch. The literature on contact, touch, and team sports shows a simple and logical line of reasoning regarding the effect that touch can have on trust, interteam relations, and team performance. This is an important connection that may be overlooked by collegiate sports departments and professional leagues. Our study tapped into this line of reasoning, but did not fully deliver on its premise.\n\nOur study did have its strengths. After a careful review of the available literature, we drew conclusions that were backed up, though mildly, by our findings. We had immediate access to several Salem State basketball games to review, and our coding sheet – taken from a very similar study published in a scholarly journal – was solid. To make sure the coding between both us was similar, we overlapped coding one game and compared the results; our results were 87.9% similar, which gave us the confidence to be able to code the rest of the games separately.\n\nThere were, however, various weaknesses in our study as well. First, we did not have many games available to look at. With only 8 games, we did not have a large enough pool of results to draw from to confidently be able to reject the null hypothesis even with a potentially stronger correlation. In addition to this, Salem State won 7 of the 8 games; with this result, we were unable to compare accurately the effect that touch had on wins and losses and thus had to discard one of our initial variables.\n\nAnother weakness in our study was the fact that not every game was recorded by the same camera man, and thus there were differences in how the games could be viewed by the coders. Some cameramen would zoom out and show a larger portion of the court, while others would zoom in on the current action. This, obviously, changes how much contact the coders can see at any given time and thus might skew the results. Some cameramen also faded in and out at different times, some showing more downtime between timeouts and halftime and others showing less.\n\nAnother weakness lies in the fact that every single one of the games that we viewed and had access to were home games. One study, done to calculate the advantage of home teams and “quantify the advantage of a home victory” found that “A significant advantage for home teams was observed across all conditions” (Jameson 2010). Thus, the fact that Salem State won so many times and scored as well as it did might be attributed more to the fact that these games were home games and less to the fact that there was a good amount of contact. Alternatively, there is a chance that there was more contact because they were home games as well, but any supposition is merely speculation at this point. Along with this point on home games, another thing which must be considered is crowd support for teams – some away teams had audible and visible crowd support while others had little to none.\n\nOne must also consider the fact that some teams are simply better than others and are going to score more points regardless of the amount of contact that is made between their team or the other’s. There are schools who pour, as mentioned in the introduction, large amounts of money into athletic programs and do their best to attract the greatest athletes into their departments; these schools simply will, in the majority of cases, have the best teams and score more points against a team which has less resources at its disposal no matter what.\n\nFinally, there are other small things which could possibly affect the results of this study. The fatigue level of a team, for example, could affect the amount of contact: extra energy could cause team mates to engage in more contact with each other, whereas a team with little energy could use less contact to conserve what they have but still score well because they conserved it.\n\nWe would advise other researchers to continue in our line of study due to the potential for real, concrete results that we may have scratched the surface of. However, we would want them to make some major changes in how they approach the study to eliminate the various weaknesses we had in ours. First, they should view a larger number of games between many different teams, both home and away. Second, they should record the games themselves and use a constant, wide out zoom so they can view the entirety of the court and catch all of the contact on camera for later coding. Third, researchers should go to greater lengths to standardize and homogenize the coding between the various coders so there is less of a difference between the coding and a greater chance for genuine, accurate results; another way to go about this is to have every game coded a number of times and to average the number of contacts recorded.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the research question – Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball? – we sought to determine whether there was a relationship between the amounts of in-game contact between teammates on a basketball team over the duration of a season and greater success in their record of winning games. The Salem State University men’s basketball team and their opponents in-game contact was coded during the home games of the 2012-2013 men’s basketball season. Games were coded and measured for in-game contact by two separate coders by watching publicly available archived footage of home basketball games from Salem Access television and recording, on a checklist, in-game contact for both teams in its various forms.\n\nThe coders judged the occurrence of in-game contact of the Salem State University men’s basketball and their opponents. Coders recorded each touch between players and the type of touch. We focused our analysis on twelve distinct types of touch that occurred when two or more players were in the midst of celebrating a positive play that helped their team (e.g., making a shot). These celebratory touches included fist bumps, high fives, chest bumps, leaping shoulder bumps, chest punches, head slaps, head grabs, low fives, high tens, full hugs, half hugs, and team huddles. (Kraus, Huang & Keltner, 2010)\n\nPerformance and success in basketball can be assessed using a number of indicators but scoring points has typically been considered one of the best ways to measure performance. We sought to establish whether there was a correlation between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored for the number of games coded and the number of teams coded for each game. The results of our correlation study between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome.\n\nAlthough results of our correlation study  between the amount of in-game contact and the number of points scored resulted in a Weak-Positive outcome, we found that Salem State had won seven out of the eight 2012-2013 men’s college basketball season home games that were coded. In each of the eight games, the in-game contact between Salem State teammates exceeded the amount of contact between the teammates on their opponents visiting teams. At face value, these results positively answered our research question- Does more in-game contact between teammates lead to greater success in basketball?\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCourel, J., Suárez, E., Ortega, E., Piñar, M., & Cárdenas, D.

            "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs. LeBron: Who Faced Tougher Competition in the NBA Finals?\n\nBy Jason McIntyre | Jun 26, 2013\n\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James.\n\nMichael Jordan finished his brilliant NBA career with six championships. LeBron James â only 28 â has won two titles. Nate Silver of the Times had a great breakdown of where they both were at 28, and what LeBronâs chances are of catching Jordanâs six rings. (Spoiler: 30 percent). Also, hereâs a graphic that was making the rounds on the internet over the weekend that you may be interested in:\n\nUndeniable: LeBron has accomplished more at this stage in his NBA career than Jordan has. [Counter: But Jordan went to college!]\n\nI wanted to take a slightly different angle. The 80âs belonged to Magic and Larry. Magicâs last game in his prime was in 1991 (letâs not count that brief run in 1996), and Birdâs was in 1992 at the age of 35. Then, Michael Jordan took over. Many a basketball argument has boiled down to, âhey, Jordan was beating up on a watered-down league compared to the 80s â there were far fewer legendary stars.â [Counter: Huh? The 80s were all Lakers/Celtics with a smattering of Dr. J, Moses and the Pistons.]\n\nI thought itâd be interesting to look back at the teams Jordan beat in his six trips to the Finals against the four teams LeBron has faced in the Finals so far.\n\n1991: Bulls 4, LA Lakers 1 â Lakers won Game 1, Bulls owned rest of the series. Scott & Worthy were hurt and missed Game 5. Scott took just 18 shots in the series.\n1992: Bulls 4, Portland 2 â Probably the weakest team the Bulls beat in Jordanâs six trips to the Finals. Won 57 games. Drexler in his prime.\n1993: Bulls 4, Phoenix 2 â Iâd listen to an argument that all of LeBronâs Finals opponents were better than this Suns team. Won 62 games. Barkley was the NBA MVP.\n\n1996: Bulls 4, Seattle 2 â A good Sonics team, and Kemp had a beastly series, but heâs not Dirk, thatâs for sure. Won 64 games.\n1997: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Might be the best team Jordan beat in the Finals. Karl Malone was the League MVP. Won 64 games.\n1998: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Virtually the exact same core as the year prior. Won 62 games.\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the teams Jordan beat in the Finals: 1) 91 Lakers, 2) 97 Jazz, 3) 98 Jazz, 4) 93 Suns, 5) 96 Sonics, 6) 92 Blazers.\n\nLeBronâs Final opponents? This is probably due to recency bias, but Iâd say theyâve been considerably tougher than the teams Jordan beat:\n\n2007: Spurs 4, Cavaliers 0 â The Spurs went 16-4 in the playoffs. Tim Duncan is a Top 10 player in NBA history and better than any of the players Jordan beat, with the exception of Magic. [Counter: 1991 Magic led the NBA in turnovers, his shooting from the field was in steady decline, he was only 2nd in the NBA in assists, and the Lakers were at the end of their dynasty, finishing 2nd in the West.] Tony Parker was the MVP of this series, and just for fun â¦ in the annals of NBA history, who will wind up thought of as the better player, Tony Parker or Gary Payton? Tony Parker or John Stockton?\n\n2011: Mavericks 4, Heat 2 â Dirk Nowitzki is considered one of the best shooting forwards in NBA history. Barkley or Dirk? Barkley was 29 on his only trip to the Finals, and averaged 27 points and 13 rebounds in that series. He had 32-12-10 in a Game 4 loss, and 42-13 in a Game 2 loss. Dirk or Kemp? Dirk or Mailman? Dirk averaged 26-9 in the 2011 Finals, and made 45 of 46 free throws. Fun discussion where thereâs no right or wrong answer: Was Dirk a more complete player than Barkley, Kemp and Mailman? The Mavs beat Kobe, Durant and LeBron in the postseason.\n\n2012: Heat 4, Thunder 1 â Difficult to say how good this Thunder team was. We may not know for a few years. But at this rate, Durant and Westbrook (assuming they stick together) could end up having Hall of Fame careers and being similar to Stockton/Malone, who went to the Finals twice. Jordan never faced a dominant young scoring tandem such as Durant and Westbrook in the Finals.\n\n2013: Heat 4, Spurs 3: Duncan at 37, Ginobili at 35. And San Antonio benefited from the Westbrook injury (and swept the Lakers minus Kobe). The West was such a mess, the Spurs struggled against the Warriors (4-2), then swept the Grizzlies, who were only there because of the Westbrook injury. Iâd compare these Spurs tot he 1991 Lakers, but that Laker team was injured and not nearly as old. Comparing across decades is impossible and an exercise in futility, but wouldnât this yearâs Spurs team have beaten any of Jordanâs Finals opponents?\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the 10 opponents Jordan and LeBron have faced in the Finals:\n\n1. 2007 Spurs (LeBron)\n2. 1991 Lakers (Jordan)\n3. 2011 Mavericks (LeBron)\n4. 1997 Jazz (Jordan)\n5. 1998 Jazz (Jordan)\n6. 2013 Spurs (LeBron)\n7. 2012 Thunder (LeBron)\n8. 1993 Suns (Jordan)\n9. 1996 Sonics (Jordan)\n10. 1992 Blazers (Jordan)\n\nÂ© 2025 TheBigLead - All Rights Reserved\n\n"

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something. \nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\nThe overall picture\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\nNot so fast...\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\nIt's not just the first round either.\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat. \nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\nHardest Pre-Finals Opponents\nTeam    Round   Rating  Who?    Result\n1986 Celtics    1st Round   1770    MJ  Lost\n1989 Pistons    Conf Finals 1767    MJ  Lost\n2008 Celtics    Conf Semis  1700    LeBron  Lost\n2011 Bulls  Conf Finals 1698    LeBron  Won\n1985 Bucks  1st Round   1697    MJ  Lost\n1993 Knicks Conf Finals 1696    MJ  Won\n1990 Pistons    Conf Finals 1686    MJ  Lost\n1998 Pacers Conf Finals 1680    MJ  Won\n2009 Magic  Conf Finals 1680    LeBron  Lost\n1987 Celtics    1st Round   1676    MJ  Lost\n1996 Magic  Conf Finals 1671    MJ  Won\nDid LeBron have it easier prior to reaching the Finals? Yes.\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\nFinals opponents\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year. \nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition. \nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\nEvery Finals Opponent\nTeam    Rating  Opponent\n2017 Warriors   1850    LeBron\n2015 Warriors   1802    LeBron\n2016 Warriors   1790    LeBron\n1998 Jazz   1762    MJ\n1997 Jazz   1751    MJ\n2012 Thunder    1737    LeBron\n2014 Spurs  1730    LeBron\n2011 Mavericks  1717    LeBron\n2013 Spurs  1711    LeBron\n2018 Warriors   1710    LeBron\n2007 Spurs  1705    LeBron\n1992 Blazers    1702    MJ\n1991 Lakers 1697    MJ\n1996 Sonics 1695    MJ\n1993 Suns   1634    MJ\nIt's a team sport!\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\nIt's impossible to know.\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings. \nELO Rating in Finals\n    Jordan  LeBron\nTeam rating 1770    1687\nOpponent    1706    1750\nDifference  +64 -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\nMJ and LeBron in Finals\nInfogram\nWhat does all of this mean?\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\nMICAH ADAMS\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.

            "raw_content": "How the Dennis Rodman trade helped the Chicago Bulls\n\nStephen Beslic | Apr 9, 2023\n\nBefore the start of the 1995-96 season, the Chicago Bulls traded backup center Will Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for Dennis Rodman, who was then a two-time NBA champion, four-time NBA rebounding champion, and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAt the time of the trade, Rodman was considered highly talented, but also extremely controversial. Rodman clashed with coaches, teammates, and the media during his time in San Antonio, so the Spurs were eager to move on from him despite his impressive rebounding abilities.\n\nImproving frontcourt defense\n\nThe Bulls saw an opportunity to add an excellent defender and rebounder to their already talented roster. Rodmanâs presence helped the Bulls improve their frontcourt defense which gave them a better chance of winning another NBA championship.\n\nBulls general manager Jerry Krause and head coach Phil Jackson talked a lot with Rodman before trading for him. According to Jackson, Krause left the decision to acquire Rodman up to him. Jordan and Pippen approved the move.\n\nâPhil and I talked very carefully about this,â Krause said. âWe did an awful lot of homework and found out a lot of things. We were both satisfied.â\n\nThe Rodman effect\n\nThe Bulls were hurting on the boards since losing Horace Grant to free agency in 1994, and Jordanâs return forced Toni Kukoc to play out of position at power forward.\n\nThe 1995-96 campaign was the final year of Rodmanâs contract, and he exceeded expectations, averaging 5.5 points, 2.5 assists and a league-best 14.9 rebounds in 32.6 minutes over 64 games in the regular season while behaving well. The Bulls decided to extend his contract for two more years.\n\nâThe one promise we made to Dennis, was, we said at the beginning, when we first talked, we said at the end of the year we will sit down and weâll talk about the future, and I think thatâs what we are gonna do, we are going to sit down at the end of the year,â Krause told Jim Gray from NBC Sports before the Bulls played the Magic in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nâDennis has been outstanding, he hasnât missed a practice, he hasnât been late, heâs done the things weâve asked him to do on the basketball court, heâs a tremendous practice player, Dennis has been very good for this team and I believe that heâs a good person.â\n\nRodman averaged 5.2 points, 15.3 rebounds and 2.8 assists in 34.6 minutes over 199 regular season games with the Bulls from 1996 to 1998. He won three rebounding titles and even averaged a career-high 3.1 assists in 1997.\n\nThe five-time NBA champion averaged 5.4 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 32.4 minutes over 58 playoff games with the Bulls.\n\nIn the end, the trade worked out well for the Bulls and the Spurs. Rodman thrived in Chicago, playing a crucial role in helping the Bulls win three NBA championships in a row from 1996 to 1998.\n\nPerdue, on the other hand, played a solid role for the Spurs as a backup center, and they went on to win their first NBA championship in 1999.\n\nStephen Beslic is a writer on Sports Illustrated's FanNation Network.

Now, there are many factors that go into making one era of basketball “better” over the other. I put that word into quotations because better is subjective, especially using the formula I follow. Either way, I am making the case for why the NBA in the 1990s was a golden era for basketball fans.\n\nOne of the main reasons that the NBA was better in the 90s is the level of competition. The league was home to some of the most iconic and talented teams in history, such as the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics. The combinations these teams had of dominant star power and prominent role players ruled the decade.\n\n[mm-video type=playlist id=01g02gm8ss4hdkf69q player_id=01fknyrrh48xrn02qp image=]\n\nTwo rosters that are often compared between the 90s and the current state of the NBA were the Bulls of the 90s and the Golden State Warriors of 2015-2018. These are two of the most successful teams in NBA history. While both teams achieved great success, there are some key differences between the two.\n\nOne of the most significant differences is the style of play. The Bulls relied on Michael Jordan to be their primary scorer and be their go-to in clutch situations. Around Jordan were a mixture of prominent players that can stand in their own right; however, it was primarily role players that built the team to what we know them as. On the other hand, the Warriors put an emphasis on ball movement and three-point shooting. They had a longer list of All-Star players than the Bulls did.\n\nThe style of play in the NBA has changed significantly since the 1990s. This is the subjective aspect of the era comparison. It all depends on what style of play keeps your eyes peeled and gets you excited. One major difference in the style of play and one that leads me to prefer the 90s is the emphasis on physicality. This era was known for its tough, rugged play, with hard fouls and physical play being a common occurrence. However, the current era of the NBA is more focused on player safety, which leads to a reduction in physical play. There are many fouls that are called today that wouldn’t be called in the 90s. Player safety is extremely important, but the toughness in previous eras of basketball are more enjoyable.\n\nThe current NBA emphasizes the use of the three-point shot, which was very unlike the league in the 90s. Teams used to rely more on driving to the basket and working the ball inside, rather than taking long-range shots. Now teams use the three-point shot as a part of their game and some players often emphasize it as a part of their game. With more inside play, defense was also more emphasized in the 1990s. In contrast, the current era of the NBA places a greater emphasis on offense, leading to higher scoring games but also a decrease in the level of defensive play. Not only that, but the new era has led to players being more reliant on their talent and physical attributes rather than their basketball IQ in addition to their talent.\n\nIt seems like the amount of intensity and passion to the league and the games is less prevalent than there once was. Teams are more likely to put their passions to complain about a foul called on them rather than putting their passions to winning games and being left hungry for more when losing games. This has led to the 1990s being the superior era of the NBA over the modern era.\n\nTWSN is committed to delivering high-quality sports content that stands out in today’s fast-paced media world.

            "raw_content": "NBA : The Old School Era Versus The Modern Era\n\nIf you are a basketball fan, it is very likely that you have been a part of a discussion involving the nostalgic old-school NBA vs the new basketball era. Who doesn't like and appreciate the physicality of the games in the 80s and 90s, with players like Magic Johnson and Penny Hardaway at the point guard positions, things were nasty on the hardwood back in the day.\n\nThis decade of NBA has really hit hard on the infamous rivalries between the teams, thanks to players changing teams to win the championships instead of leading their forte to the gold. Gone are the days when matchups like the Boston Celtics vs Los Angeles Lakers bought the viewers to the edge of their seats.\n\nThe veteran NBA players on numerous occasions claimed that the present day NBA is \"Soft\". It has been a topic of debate whether the NBA is as entertaining as it used to be. Back in the day, Reggie Miller after hitting the game winning 3-pointer against the New York Knicks, followed it by the infamous \"Taunt\" to Spike Lee sitting on the sidelines, did not get him a Technical Foul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the NBA today, fans may see their team player be ejected out of the game for a little trash talk.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThis contrast in the style of game between the two eras can be traced back to the NBA introducing the \"No hand check\" rule in the mid-2000's. This rule has not only altered the playstyle by reducing the contact in the game but has also made the game faster and skill-oriented. This rule, however, if introduced in Jordan's era, we would have been looking at more than 30 PPG as his career stat.\n\nThe new age NBA has also witnessed the skyrocketing number of threes launched, owing to the likes of Steph Curry's and the Golden State Warriors. The players camp up at the three-point line or make screening efforts to free their shooter to hit the 3 shot. As spectacular as the splashes are, it has further reduced the number of plays actually seeing some rim action. The game today, demands even the power and small forwards with some skill at the 3 point line. We see big men line LeBron James and Kevin Durant making the game-winning 3s.\n\nThe league then introduced the \"No forearm check\" rule which reduced the already depleted contact between the opposing players. The defenders then had to rely on their feet to defend the oncoming offense. This had a huge impact on the mid-range game, where Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley dominated. Also, now with \"flopping\" being as nasty as it is in football, NBA is seeing very little defense and a failed crossover brings the audience to its feet.\n\nTalking about the badass 90s in the league, who does not miss the centers like Dikembe Mutombo and David Robinson? Their dominating guard in the paint was like a cannon defending a fort. The Seven ft. human barriers would serve as a challenge to all the offense. Patrick Ewing's post moves with Shaq's domination would show how much physical that era was.\n\nToday, Joakim Noah and Dwight Howard do not show that level of dominance and pivotal role in the game as it was earlier. This can be dated back to the days when the \"Offensive 3-second rule\" was announced. This rule, over the years, impacted the position of the center and evolved them to the power forward side.\n\nIt is no surprise that the NBA now is more play and calculated strategy oriented game. Kyrie Irving and Russel Westbrook have shown how point guards are beyond just passing and making assists. It will be exciting to see how the NBA from here on evolves and amazes it viewers which it has been doing since years.\n\nanant vijay\n\n\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nRanking Each Decade of NBA Basketball, from the 1960s to Today\n\nThroughout NBA history, we've experienced the purity of the 1960s, the creativity and growth of the '70s, the sheer competitive nature of the '80s, the on-court brilliance of the '90s, the raw athleticism of the '00s and the yet-to-be-determined, but certainly impressive, legacy of our current decade.\n\nThey all bring different elements to the table, but which one is the best of all time?\n\nIn order to put each of the six decades into their proper order, we've asked six writers to make a case for their favorite era, and we've also asked B/R's NBA writers and editors to rank them from best to worst in six different categories: entertainment value, competitive balance, athleticism, overall quality of play and star power.\n\nForty-five writers and editors participated in this voting, with an average age of 26.1.\n\nEach category was weighted evenly, and the overall rankings were determined by the decades' standings in these six criteria. Receiving a 6.00 in a category was the best possible result, as that would indicate that each of the 45 NBA writers polled gave that decade the top spot. Conversely, a 1.00 in a category means that all 45 writers voted that decade last.\n\nThe scores for each category were summed to produce the overall ranking, with 30 being a perfect score.\n\nYou'll see our opinions here, but which decade was the greatest in your eyes, and why?\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 8.55)\n\n\n\nThe NBA in the 1960s was rougher, tougher, smaller and less visible than just about every decade that followed. But it may have been the best basketball decade of them all.\n\nThe Boston Celtics dominated. Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a game. Jerry West modeled the NBA logo, the league expanded and television audiences took notice.\n\nThe brutish big man was the prized commodity in an era characterized by physicality. Chamberlain and Bill Russell won nine of the 11 MVP awards between 1958 and 1968.\n\nWhile condensed in size and geographical scope, the league possessed some of the greatest players to ever set foot on the court.\n\nAnd like the world around it, the NBA went through major changes during the 1960s.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.58)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.22)\n\nBack then, baseball ruled. My heroes were Mickey Mantle and Sandy Koufax, men who transcended their sport and lived in the mainstream consciousness. Chamberlain and Russell, despite their impact night in and night out, didn’t make the same headlines, and so I didn’t consider them superstars.\n\nLeague-wide attendance at MLB games in 1965 was 22 million, while the NBA drew a paltry two million fans for its games.\n\nThe NBA may have had great athletes, but when your sport is only televised once a week—Sundays on ABC—it’s hard to get any kind of notoriety.\n\nThis was pre-David Stern, pre-Nike and pre-superhuge television contracts. When Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points for the Philadelphia Warriors, only 4,124 fans witnessed it. And even then, it didn’t immediately translate into sponsorship dollars for the big man.\n\nImagine LeBron going off for 30, 11 and 10—you’ll know within minutes via your mobile app or by checking any mainstream sports website. But back in the day, as they say, you wouldn’t know until the next day’s morning newspaper.\n\nBut, it really wasn’t until Willis Reed’s gimpy heroics in Game 7 against the L.A. Lakers of the 1969-70 Finals that the world began to take notice of the league.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 2.24)\n\nQuite simply, there really wasn’t any competitive balance.\n\nLed by Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek and coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won nine championships, including eight straight from 1959-66, the longest championship streak in NBA history.\n\nIn fact, some consider the 1964-65 Celtics to be the best NBA team ever.\n\nSure, the Lakers played in the Finals seven times in 10 years, but it was hardly a two-team league, as the St. Louis Hawks, San Francisco Warriors, Baltimore Bullets and Cincinnati Royals also sported solid teams.\n\nYet, rather than fade away due to lack of competition, the NBA would flourish in ensuing years.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.67)\n\nIt is doubtful that there is another era with as many great stars. Bob Cousy, Bill Bradley, Jerry Lucas, Nate Thurmond, Willis Reed, Walt Frazier, Dave Bing, Earl Monroe and John Havlicek stand out, but here are five that created NBA standards.\n\nPut LeBron James and Magic Johnson together, and you get Oscar Robertson. At 6”5’, 220 pounds, the Big O was a big guard playing against smaller competitors and the only player to have averaged a triple-double for a season.\n\nJerry West exemplified the ideal of fundamental basketball so perfectly he became the model for the NBA icon and was known as “Mr. Clutch” for his uncanny ability to win games when it mattered most.\n\nWilt Chamberlain may have been the greatest athlete of his day. At 7’1”, 275 pounds, he had been a track star before turning the game of basketball on end with his dominance. In the 1961-62 season alone, he averaged an unprecedented 50.4 points per game, during which he had 100-, 78-, 73- and 67-point games.\n\nWere it not for Bill Russell, it may have been Chamberlain holding the most NBA championships. But, Russell, at only 6’9”, understood the idea of team play and redefined the role of the NBA big man. Russell won 11 titles, including eight consecutively. He was a rebounding machine and averaged 22.5 rebounds per game, once taking down 51 in a single game.\n\nWithout Elgin Baylor, there would be no Dr. J, no Dominique Wilkins and perhaps no Michael Jordan. The high-flying small forward had ridiculous hang time, averaged a double-double most of his career and, during the 1961-62 season, put up 38.3 PPG, second only to Wilt in NBA history.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Sixth (score: 1.84)\n\nNine. That’s how many times Jerry West had his nose broken as he ventured into the key for a layup. Today’s freewheeling guards would have thought twice about going inside against the likes of Wilt, Russell, Nate “The Great” Thurmond and Jerry Lucas.\n\nThe era preceded the three-point shot, so inside-big-man toughness coupled with excellent fundamental play make the 1960s the decade to contend with.\n\nThe '60s were also a time of radical change as players such as Walt Frazier, Dave Bing and Earl “The Pearl” Monroe brought an inventive flair to the court. By the end of decade, the offense extended its play to the perimeter, ball-handlers proliferated and the NBA never looked back.\n\n-Rich Leivenberg, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 13.04)\n\n\n\nThe 1970s opened on the yawning chasm created by Bill Russell's retirement.\n\nAnd the NBA had a pesky competitor in the ABA, which was not so much a professional basketball league as a petri dish for the fusion of street-ball-honed agility with Harlem Globetrotter-esque showmanship.\n\nAs the movie Semi-Pro suggests, the ABA was a fly-by-night operation for some; several teams were imbued with a lunacy only equaled by Bill Veeck. Quirky halftime shows were as familiar as attempts to lure stars away from the NBA, with Rick Barry becoming the most notable turncoat.\n\nThe fledgling ABA gradually gained notoriety and actually began beating the senior league consistently in their head-to-head exhibition games. In 1976, the NBA finally accepted its red-white-and-blue stepchild as part of the family.\n\nThus, '70s basketball became acid jazz meets track and field.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.40)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.04)\n\nThis was the first decade when players other than just the gargantuan centers began to dunk with regularity. Back when he was Lew Alcindor, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar prompted the NCAA to ban dunking for 10 years, but he brought that style right into the NBA.\n\nOf course, the cavalier ABA spawned various innovations in such airy flair. Not only was George \"The Iceman\" Gervin's finger roll poetry in motion, but both Julius Erving and David Thompson turned dunking into an art form. They weren't known as \"Dr. J\" and \"Skywalker\" for nothing.\n\nDr. J essentially invented the free-throw-line slam dunk at the 1976 ABA All-Star festivities, the genesis of the NBA's dunk contest. Erving etched himself into collective basketball memory with those effortlessly loping leaps.\n\nThese ABA dunkers paved the way for the backboard-breaking Darryl \"Chocolate Thunder\" Dawkins (from the planet Lovetron). The ABA also helped cement the three-point shot into rule, so Stephen Curry and Ray Allen owe the bygone league a fruit basket.\n\n\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 4.22)\n\nIn 10 years, eight different teams won the NBA title. Only the New York Knicks and Boston Celtics won more than one, and neither won back-to-back titles. The Knicks' Hall of Famers won two titles in the decade's first four years, announcing the end to the Celtics' reign of terror.\n\nBut no clear heir to the throne stepped forth, bringing some much-needed parity to the sport.\n\nThe NBA absorbed the four best teams from the ABA—the New York Nets, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs—helping to augment the competitive balance in pro basketball.\n\nBut the old NBA franchises still dominated, just in greater numbers.\n\nThe Washington Bullets became a powerhouse; the '77 Portland Trail Blazers formed a ragtag band of underdog champs; even the Golden State Warriors and Seattle SuperSonics each won a title.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 1.98)\n\nMany superstars wound their careers down in the '70s: Jerry West and Oscar Robertson, who got their only championships, as well as Elgin Baylor, Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, John Havlicek, Lenny Wilkens, Nate Thurmond and Jerry Lucas.\n\nWilt Chamberlain passed the big-man torch to Kareem, and the stage was set.\n\nTiny Archibald and Bob McAdoo dazzled fans from both ends of the height spectrum, while Bill Walton and Artis Gilmore enthralled with their tremendous tresses. There were wild cards like Darnell Hillman and World B. Free, and anomalies like the spectacularly bearded Gar Heard, who stood 6'6\" but blocked shots like he was 7'6\".\n\nAlso on the scene were Hall of Famers Dave Bing, Bill Bradley, Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld, who were joined by Dave Cowens, \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich, Dennis Johnson, plus near-HOFers Bob Dandridge and Spencer Haywood.\n\nAnd to the list of big ABA transplants, you can write in Maurice Lucas and Dan Issel beside Skywalker and Dr. J.\n\nThe ABA also allowed Moses Malone to enter the draft right out of high school, setting the stage for Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 2.40)\n\nBoth despite and because of all the expansion, cocaine, salary inflation, free agency, left-wing politics and competitive parity, the '70s were a watershed for basketball.\n\nThere were ugly moments to be sure, like Kermit Washington's devastating on-court knockout of Rudy Tomjanovich.\n\nBut, ultimately, the beautiful evolution of the game won out in history. It was a decade of modernization just as much as tumult, of style as much as substance.\n\n-Sean Hojnacki, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 18.55)\n\nThe first 10 years of the 21st century were famous (and infamous) for Lakers and Spurs dominance, 81 points scored by one player and the Malice in the Palace. A few teams—the Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic, Dallas Mavericks and Cleveland Cavaliers—all had brief flirtations with fame.\n\nThe 2000s also produced some of the most dramatic moments in NBA history, individual plays that will stand out for decades to come.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\n\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.29)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Second (score: 4.73)\n\nIf you were a fan of the Lakers living in Los Angeles during this decade, you were in basketball heaven.  In spite of the ongoing Kobe-Shaq feuds, the Lakers were the darlings of the local sports world.\n\nTheir home, Staples Center, first opened in October 1999, instantly becoming an entertainment icon and the place to be and be seen. Big games on big stages became commonplace, and spring in Los Angeles usually meant Lakers postseason exploits on the hardwood once more.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 3.84)\n\nThe aughts were marked by the sheer dominance of two distinctly unique franchises: the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Spurs gave hope to small-market teams by winning three championships from 2000-09, while the Lakers went to the Finals six times under Phil Jackson and won four of them.\n\nThe Spurs were built from the ground up and continue to be one of the most stable franchises due to the game's best head coach, Gregg Popovich.\n\nThe Lakers were the creation of general manager Jerry West, the mastermind who orchestrated the signings of both Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal, and the brilliant trade with Charlotte that sent Vlade Divac to the Hornets for its No. 13 pick in the 1996 draft, a young kid named Kobe Bean Bryant.\n\nExcept for one year (when Dallas made it), the NBA Finals featured either the Lakers or Spurs from the Western Conference.\n\n\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.38)\n\nKobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal grabbed most of the headlines and are locks for the Hall of Fame. But there were other greats who lit up the scoreboard or passed their way to fame during the decade.\n\nAmong the most fun to watch were Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo Anthony, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Steve Nash, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, Jason Kidd and Allen Iverson.\n\nNash and Kidd are two of the best passers ever, while Nowitzki may be the best pure-shooting big man in the history of the game. Ray Allen has more three-pointers than anyone (via ESPN.com), and Bryant was lighting up scoreboards (81 points in 2006) and winning championship rings with and without the formidable O'Neal.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.31)\n\nTo win during this decade, a team needed two or three superstars and a strong bench. Individual talent was probably better than it had ever been, but some of the weaker teams just couldn't seem to get on track.\n\nUnlike the NFL, the NBA has never been about team parity. Still, it is safe to say this decade produced some of the best teams, top players and most exciting moments the league has ever been witness to.\n\nThe most improbable moment? There were many, but for me, it had to be Derek Fisher's catch, turn and shoot miracle with four-tenths of a second on the clock to beat the Spurs in Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference Semifinals. That will never happen again.\n\n-Howard Ruben, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 20.95)\n\n\n\nWe’re only three years into the NBA’s newest decade, but there’s already plenty of evidence to suggest that the league is heading toward a new summit.\n\nThe regular season is as entertaining as it’s been in some time, with recent postseason play redefining the standard of excellence we expect to be treated to on a nightly basis.\n\nWith a revolution occurring before our very eyes, this decade will set historic standards for what fans should expect from future generations.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Third (score: 3.87)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: First (score: 5.71)\n\nHas there ever been a more fun time to watch NBA basketball? The athletes who grace our screens every night are simply breathtaking to watch, and they’ve committed themselves to playing ferociously on both ends of the floor.\n\nIn addition, an overlooked aspect of the NBA’s entertainment value during this decade is the ubiquity with which the game is available to fans. Platforms like League Pass have allowed consumers to become more knowledgeable than ever, while social-media sites like Twitter have allowed us to engage in conversation and debate with other fans, players and pundits.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.51)\n\nAlthough we appear to be shifting to an era where super-teams like the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers are the norm, the breadth and depth of talent across the NBA is astounding.\n\nAnd, as the Heat and Lakers each proved to us in their first seasons together, super-teams aren’t blessed with immunity to seemingly \"inferior\" squads just because of the hype they receive. Despite the apparent dominance of big-market franchises, the brilliance displayed by several small-market general managers throughout the decade has provided the league with competitive balance. Success stories like those of the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder, Memphis Grizzlies and Indiana Pacers are proving that intelligent front offices can build teams that are prosperous in the long run.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 4.04)\n\nThe obvious starting point here is LeBron James, who, according to Basketball-Reference’s Hall of Fame probability calculator, is a shoo-in with a rating of 0.9987. Already possessing one NBA title, a Finals MVP and three regular-season MVP awards at the age of 28, LeBron will define the current era just like Michael Jordan did in the 1990s.\n\nHowever, aside from LeBron, there are several players who will peak during the 2010s, with studs like Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Rajon Rondo, Dwight Howard, Carmelo Anthony and Derrick Rose all capable of playing at historically elite levels. You could even make the argument that Dwyane Wade’s been playing the best ball of his career since turning 30 in 2012.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Third (score: 3.82)\n\nWith such a deep pool of talent, it’s no surprise that the NBA’s current decade has been characterized by an extremely high level of play.\n\nPlayers like LeBron James and Russell Westbrook continue to redefine conventional positions and squash the stereotypes that accompany them. So while the league may be in a transition phase, the expansive skill sets we see displayed on a nightly basis are simply breathtaking. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks.\n\n-Alec Nathan, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (21.08 overall)\n\n\n\nImagine your car breaking down in Bethel, N.Y., outside Max Yasgur’s dairy farm, on Aug. 15, 1969.\n\nYou see the crowd, you hear the music...and you suddenly realize something big is happening, and you are fortunate, blessed even, to be in the right place at the right time.\n\nThat’s what it was to be an NBA fan in the 1980s.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: Second (score: 4.56)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Fourth (score: 3.07)\n\nThe decade was unquestionably defined by the league’s greatest all-time rivalry: Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers versus Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics.\n\n“But we had Lakers-Celtics with Chamberlain and Russell,” you older readers might say.\n\nTrue. The difference is: This time, everybody was watching.\n\nThe ‘80s were the decade where, because of Bird and Magic, the league came into its own, became a part of the cultural zeitgeist and was must-see TV long before the brain trust at NBC thought of the phrase.\n\nAfter the tough times of Vietnam, Watergate, OPEC and recession, weary audiences wanted less news and more entertainment. This mood gave rise to sound bites, music videos and—thanks to ESPN, which debuted in 1979—sports-highlight shows.\n\nThe NBA’s quick, incredible vignettes were the perfect tonic for the day.\n\nThose factors, plus the transcendent popularity of Bird and Johnson, converged to take the little-watched NBA from airing tape-delayed NBA Finals games in 1981 to more than doubling ratings by the 1988 Finals.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.18)\n\nThe Lakers and Celtics owned the '80s, even though the Detroit Pistons slowly ascended to finally dethrone both champions by the decade’s end.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers won a long-deserved championship in 1983. The Houston Rockets had the original Twin Towers. The next tier included the Atlanta Hawks, the New York Knicks and the team of the future, the Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn truth, though, the decade was devoid of parity. But we didn’t want parity. We wanted—and got—Magic’s Lakers and Bird’s Celtics in the Finals.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.60)\n\nMagic and Bird were the superstars. They, not David Stern, took the NBA from a fringe sport to a juggernaut.\n\nBoth players’ teams were chock-full of superstars, too: The Lakers’ Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, and the Celtics’ Kevin McHale, Robert Parish and Dennis Johnson are all Hall of Famers.\n\nIsiah Thomas, arguably the greatest point guard of all time, and fellow Pistons champions Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman are all enshrined in Springfield.\n\nJulius “Dr. J” Erving, the NBA’s face of the ‘70s, bridged the gap between the old guard and the Bird-Johnson era. His famous NBA Finals shot from 1980 would make Isaac Newton question himself.\n\nDominique Wilkins, the Human Highlight Film, lived up to his name every night.\n\nBernard King scored like a pinball machine.\n\nSuperstars like Charles Barkley, Moses Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon, John Stockton, Karl Malone and Clyde “The Glide” Drexler were all in their prime. The next tier of stars—Ralph Sampson, Buck Williams, Adrian Dantley, Alex English, Sidney Moncrief and George “Iceman” Gervin—were no slouches, either.\n\nAnd of course, there was some new kid named Michael Jordan.\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Second (score: 4.67)\n\nFouls could get downright brutal in the ‘80s; when those guys hit the deck, nobody was flopping.\n\nBut that meant defense was still allowed. As a result, most games were well-played and strategic, with perfectly executed give-and-gos and pick-and-rolls.\n\nThere was plenty of high-flying action, too, reminiscent of the recently absorbed ABA. For the most part, though, ‘80s play was about both fundamentals and being able to take the punishment—a combination I like to call \"real basketball.\"\n\n-Marshall Zweig, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 22.82)\n\n\n\nThe 1990s were noteworthy primarily for two things, Michael Jordan and the greatest collection of big men who ever played the game.\n\nPerhaps this is what makes the decade so incredibly interesting. Jordan slew the giants. In an era of bigs like the league had never seen, it was a perimeter player who dominated the league and forever changed the game.\n\nBecause of Jordan, and the marketing success the NBA had with him, the league changed the rules to make it more of a perimeter-oriented league. Because of his success against so many great big men, teams were trying to find that player who could do what Jordan did.\n\nAs a result, in terms of the rules, marketing, philosophy and sheer aesthetic value of the game, the '90s were transitional, morphing the game from the powerful, center-dominated league of the past into the athletic, perimeter-player-dominated league of the present.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Entertainment Value Ranking: First (score: 5.31)\n\nB/R Team Athleticism Ranking: Third (score: 4.22)\n\nThe ‘90s were a compelling decade for the entertainment value of the game. If you need proof, look no further than the television ratings and the television contracts.\n\nThe highest-rated Finals in NBA history was the 1998 showdown between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which rendered an 18.7 rating. Five of the highest six Finals ratings came in the decade.\n\nWhen the decade started, the NBA was receiving about $56 million a year in national broadcasting rights. When those 10 years ended, that number had swollen to more than $620 million a year.\n\nIf we measure entertainment by being entertained, it seems the ‘90s were a pretty entertaining decade.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: Fifth (score: 3.00)\n\nEven though the decade was dominated by the Chicago Bulls, who won six NBA championships, there were plenty of other teams who took turns rising up to challenge the Bulls. Because of that, it was still highly competitive.\n\nIn all, there were 11 different teams who made it to the Finals during the decade and another two who made it to the conference finals. That’s nearly half the league that made it to the conference finals and over a third of the league that played for a title.\n\nMuch of the decade was playing for the right to lose to Jordan, er, the Bulls, but it was a highly competitive time.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 5.33)\n\nThe best part of watching the NBA during the ‘90s was the sheer volume of stars.\n\nIt was an era that saw the sun set on Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nIt saw players like Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, John Stockton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone all in their prime.\n\nThen there was Michael Jordan.\n\nIt saw the birth of the careers of Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan.\n\nIn all, there were 21 players who played at least 150 games in the ‘90s who are already in the HOF. There are several more, such as Shaquille O’Neal, Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Duncan, who are inevitably going to get in.\n\nIt’s a safe bet you could put together an All-Star team from the ‘90s that would be the greatest team ever assembled.\n\nOf course, I only say that because they did, and it was. The original Dream Team is all you need to know (with the exception of O’Neal getting passed over for Christian Laettner).\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\nB/R Team Ranking: First (score: 4.96)\n\nThe irony of the ‘90s is, when the decade started, the conversation surrounding the NBA focused on what was going to happen without Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nInstead, it became the transitional era, where the NBA surpassed baseball as the second-most-popular sport and grew in popularity like it never had before.\n\nThe beauty of the era wasn’t just the multitude of stars; it was the types of stars there were. There were the acrobatic, gravity-defying stunts of Michael Jordan.\n\nThere was the perfect pick-and-roll action from John Stockton to Karl Malone.\n\nThere was the brute greatness of Charles Barkley, who seemed to defy the logic that height mattered and, at an exaggerated 6’6”, became one of the greatest rebounders and power forwards of all time.\n\nShawn Kemp was in his prime and dunking like no one else who came before him and no one else since, save for Blake Griffin.\n\nIt was the last great era of centers, with four of the greatest to ever play the position—Robinson, Olajuwon, Ewing and O’Neal—making it to the Finals during the decade. All but Ewing won a ring.\n\nIt says something that the rules were changed after the decade ended, maintaining the way it was played. The ‘90s, in my mind, will always be the decade where the NBA truly found itself.\n\n-Kelly Scaletta, NBA Featured Columnist\n\n"
