          "raw_content": "What's LeBron James' record in the NBA Finals? Comparing superstar forward's finals record to Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James has had a remarkable career so far, showing great longevity as he enters his 20th season in the NBA. James made his first playoff appearance during the 2005-06 season as a Cavalier.\n\nBack then, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished the regular season with a respectable 61% winning record. However, James’ playoff run was cut short, losing 4-3 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nJames came out hungry the following season, getting his revenge on the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He averaged 25.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over six games, including a 48-point performance in Game 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers won the series in six games but were swept by the fundamentalists – the San Antonio Spurs – in the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James’ four subsequent NBA Finals appearances came during his stint with the Miami Heat. Teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, James was in the NBA Finals again. However, the Dallas Mavericks came out on top in the 2011 Finals.\n\nJames was a dominant force in the following two seasons, leading his team in scoring, rebounds, and assists – in both the finals. The Miami Heat were crowned champions in 2012 & 2013, with James winning the Finals MVP in both editions.\n\nJames’ return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 sparked a new NBA Finals rivalry between them and the Golden State Warriors. They matched up in the NBA finals for four consecutive years, with LeBron James being crowned champion only once. After being swept by the Warriors in the 2018 NBA Finals, James took his services to the LA Lakers.\n\nLeBron's stint with the LA Lakers has been turbulent to say the least, given he’s made the playoffs in only two of his four seasons. Still, James did guide the Lakers to the championship in 2020.\n\nLeBron James’ NBA Finals record vs Michael Jordan’s\n\nCollectively, James has been in 10 NBA Finals, coming out victorious in four. He won the Finals MVP in all those editions, matching up as closely with his idol, Michael Jordan, as he could. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, has reached the NBA Finals just six times in his 15 seasons.\n\nHowever, Michael Jordan’s record in the NBA Finals is what sets him apart. Like James, Jordan was the top-performer in all his championship runs – earning the Finals MVP award in all six editions.\n\nBut Jordan was able to win the title in all six appearances – completing two three-peats. James’ winning percentage (40%) in the NBA Finals, taking nothing away from his efforts, will always be brought up in any comparison with Jordan.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Comparing Career Scoring Totals\n\nMitch Goldich | Mar 7, 2019\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points Wednesday in the Lakers' 115-99 loss to the Nuggets. It would likely go down as a forgettable result in a season heâd like to forget, save for one major news item: He passed Michael Jordan on the NBAâs all-time career scoring list.\n\nAs his 16th season winds down, LeBron has now racked up 32,311 points, even more than the 32,292 points MJ tallied in his 15 regular seasons. LeBron is now fourth all-time in scoring, trailing just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant.\n\nSo today is the day. I will personally make the case that determines which of these two players is better and we will all agree forever. OK, probably not. There are other places on the internet to read those kinds of takes today. Instead Iâll just present some graphs and charts to compare the scoring outputs from these two all-time greats.\n\n1. Total points by age\n\nHere are their career points scored, broken down by age. In this case age means their n-age season, basically the year they were n years old on February 1, which is the way Basketball-Reference displays ages.\n\nHere you can see the advantage LeBron gained by jumping to the league straight out of high school, as he banked 3,700 points at the same ages that had Jordan wearing Carolina blue.\n\nThen you can see MJ gaining on LeBron until his baseball years (outside of his second season, when he only played 18 games in 1985-86).\n\nNow at 34, LeBron is the same age Jordan was when he finished his Bulls career with a second three-peat.\n\n2. Total points by season\n\nThis graph is similar to the one above, but now we go by season instead of age. This takes out the advantage LeBron gets from starting younger and playing all the way through. Jordanâs trajectory is no longer stunted by taking the 1993-94 season off, though you can still see the 1995 year when he played just 17 games in his return from baseball.\n\nBy this measure, Jordan was ahead of LeBron when he hung them up after his Wizards stint.\n\n3. Points per game by age4. Points per game by season\n\nThese two graphs are the same as the first two, but instead of using cumulative career points, weâll use scoring average per game during those seasons.\n\nAgain, when Jordan isnât dinged for the seasons he missed, you can see that his scoring average per season was consistently higher for most of his career.\n\nThatâs true either way you break it down, although his scoring averages as a 38- and 39-year-old in Washington, his 14th and 15th seasons, show a noticeable dip.\n\n5. Breaking down field goals, free throws and three-pointers\n\nThese pie charts basically answer the question: How did they get their points? It shows the career breakdowns for both players, and the percentage of points that came from free throws, two-point field goals and three-pointers.\n\nTheir free throw output is very close; Jordan made 7,327 and LeBron has made 7,101.\n\nThe key difference is three-point shooting. James has made 1,714 three pointers, while Jordan made just 581. Of course thatâs a result of them being products of their era. Jordan was a career 32.7% three-point shooter, while James has made a slightly better 34.4%. If Jordan played today, three-point shooting would likely be a bigger emphasis of his gameâmore attempts and he probably would have gotten even better at it.\n\n6. Breaking down points by team\n\nOne of the key differences between their careers is that Jordan spent almost all of his with the Bulls, until his late run with the Wizards. Jordanâs most famous employer swap was from the Bulls to the Birmingham Barons and back, whereas LeBron left Cleveland for Miami, came back and then again moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThis graph simply shows how many points they scored in each of their NBA uniforms.\n\n7. Breaking down points by career stop\n\nIf youâd like to take the previous graph and break it down further, this time weâll consider each of LeBronâs stops in Cleveland separately. And while weâre at it, we can carve out Jordanâs pre-baseball and post-baseball eras in Chicago.\n\nHereâs their total output during each of the various chapters in their careers.\n\n8. Scoring leader race by season\n\nIn addition to scoring more per game and more per season relative to LeBron, one thing that stands out about Jordanâs career is the way that he dominated his peers in the scoring race.\n\nJordan led the NBA in total points 11 times, including every season from 1986-87 through 1997-98 when he wasnât playing baseball.\n\nLeBron finished second in total points in eight straight seasons from 2004-05 through 2011-12, finishing behind Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (3x), Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant (3x). He didnât lead the league in total points until last season, his first time playing 82 games.\n\nThis graph shows where they finished in the league scoring (total points, not per game), based on the number of times finishing in each spot.Â  Jordan led the league 11 times, every season of his career except the two shortened Bulls seasons and the two Wizards seasons. LeBron only has that one season leading the league, but he was consistently in the Top 5. In fact, his first season in L.A. is his only time out of the Top 10, largely because of how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nIf we used points per game to show where they stood among league leaders, the graph would look very similar. Jordanâs career scoring mark of 30.12 points per game is the all-time record, and MJ won the per game scoring title 10 times. LeBron's mark of 27.15 is fourth all-time, behind Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. (For now at least. It takes three decimal places to separate James and Durant, and LeBron actually leapfrogged KD on Wednesday.)\n\nBut again, none of this is to say that Jordan was better than LeBron. Or vice versa. They each have different careers, different skills and different stories. It would be just as simplistic to boil their entire careers down to total points as it is to reduce their careers down to championship rings. They both deserve to be appreciated for what theyâve done, and on a day thatâs natural to compare their scoring output itâs fun to compare their careers in a few different ways.\n\nMitch Goldich is a senior editor for Sports Illustrated, mostly focused on the NFL.

The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.

          "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

          "raw_content": "LeBron James Crushes Michael Jordan In Key Stats\n\nThe eternal debate over basketball’s greatest of all time frequently narrows down to two luminaries: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Jordan, with his six championship rings, epitomized dominance in the ’90s, setting a virtually unparalleled standard.\n\nMeanwhile, LeBron’s unique blend of athleticism and versatility redefines what prolonged excellence looks like in the NBA.  Both icons have built near-impenetrable legacies.\n\nSo, if we delve into the numbers—championships, MVPs, and more—who truly claims the record books?\n\nNBA Championships\n\nLeBron’s quartet of championships highlights his exceptional ability to adapt and lead, having clinched titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers.  Yet, the lingering narrative of his 4-6 NBA Finals record points to the struggles he faced in securing wins when the stakes were at their highest.\n\nOn the flip side, Jordan’s six-for-six in Finals appearances with the Bulls remains the gold standard.  His undefeated Finals record stands as a monument to his peerless capacity to deliver during basketball’s most crucial moments.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-1\n\nFinals MVPs\n\nHere, LeBron’s talent for taking center stage during the NBA’s grandest series shines through, with noteworthy performances like his near triple-double series in 2016. Yet, for Jordan, every championship came paired with a Finals MVP—showcasing time and again his ability to outshine all competitors on the brightest stage.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-2\n\nRegular Season MVPs\n\nLeBron’s run of MVPs underscores his all-around impact and consistent brilliance, although he frequently found himself snubbed perhaps due to voter fatigue. For Jordan, five MVP accolades marked his reign as the unequivocal king of two Chicago Bulls dynasties, reinforcing his long-held status as the best in the league.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-3\n\nScoring Titles\n\nWhile LeBron excels as a scorer, his focus on all-around play resulted in just one scoring title. Though, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer didn’t require him to lead the league every year. Jordan, however, amassed ten scoring titles, with seven consecutive at his zenith, cementing his status as an unparalleled offensive juggernaut.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-4\n\nAssist Titles\n\nShowcasing his playmaking prowess, LeBron led the league in assists in 2020, illustrating his capability to quarterback an entire offense. Jordan’s role rarely required him to serve as the principal facilitator, although he remained adept in creating plays when necessary.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 1-4\n\nAll-NBA Selections\n\nLeBron’s 20 selections not only reflect his rarefied skill but also underscore his longevity. Remaining one of the top players over two decades is an unprecedented accomplishment. Meanwhile, Jordan’s 11 honors, achieved in a shorter span, were packed with exceptional dominance, each season testimony to his status as the league’s premier player.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 2-4\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\nLeBron’s 21 All-Star appearances further emphasize his enduring relevance and adaptability amidst evolving league dynamics. Jordan’s 14 All-Star nods, though fewer, affirm his perennial impact, with court performances that turned the exhibition into prime-time must-watch events.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 3-4\n\nAll-Star Game MVPs\n\nIn the spotlight of All-Star weekend, both icons displayed their exceptional skills, each capturing three MVP titles. LeBron dazzled with flair and dominance while remaining a crowd-pleaser. Jordan approached these games with a competitive spirit, famously engaging in a memorable clash with Kobe Bryant in 1998.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-5\n\nAll-Defensive Team Selections\n\nWhile LeBron has been formidable defensively during stretches, especially in Miami, his collective accolades don’t rival his offensive feats. Jordan’s defense was relentless, earning him nine First Team selections and reinforcing his all-around excellence.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-6\n\nDefensive Player of the Year Awards\n\nDefensive dominance is epitomized by Jordan’s 1988 DPOY award, a year in which he also led the league in scoring. It remains one of the most remarkable dual achievements in NBA history.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-7\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nBoth athletes burst onto the scene, immediately transforming their teams. LeBron’s debut season hinted at greatness as he elevated a lackluster Cavaliers squad, while Jordan’s 28.2 points per game as a rookie previewed the prolific scorer he would become.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 5-8\n\nTotal Win Shares\n\nIn terms of win shares, LeBron’s substantial total illustrates his long-term influence on team success, with his versatile skill set contributing to victory over a prolonged career. Jordan, while behind in total count, boasted immense per-season impact amplified by his legendary playoff performances.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-8\n\nCareer Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\n\nLeBron’s exceptional PER underscores his comprehensive performance levels across every statistical measure. Yet Jordan’s slight edge in this metric highlights his superior efficiency during fewer seasons, a testament to his unparalleled dominance.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-9\n\nNBA Cup Titles\n\nLeBron etched his name once more into the history books by securing the first-ever NBA Cup, adding another facet to his illustrious career.\n\nIn the expansive realm of basketball debate, the ledger leans towards Jordan. However, this ongoing discourse reminds us how each titan has left an indelible mark on the game, and, perhaps, greatness can indeed wear different forms.\n\nLatest Miami Heat News & Rumors To Your Inbox\n\nStart your day with latest Miami Heat news and rumors in your inbox.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James Vs Michael Jordan: Who Was the Better Defender Between the Two GOAT Candidates?\n\nShubham Singh|PublishedJan 30, 2024\n\nCredits- USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA community is obsessed with the GOAT debate. Usually, the choice boils down to the two NBA legends, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Since most fans are generally interested in the two players’ contributions on the offensive end, their extraordinary defensive contributions can be often overlooked. Therefore, one interesting way of looking into the GOAT debate can be by examining Jordan and LeBron’s defensive numbers and accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo simplify the arguments, one can deploy the usage of defensive win shares and defensive rating as the predominant stats. Defensive win shares is an advanced stat that requires complex calculations. This thorough indicator takes into account the minutes played by the player and the team, league points per possession, defensive rating, and a bunch of other stats that provide a condensed fraction. Simply speaking, the higher a player’s defensive win shares, the more contributions a player has made defensively to the team.\n\nConversely, when it comes to defensive rating, a lower number is desirable. The defensive rating is measured by how many points a player allows per 100 possessions. Let us take a look at how LeBron James and Michael Jordan do in these two categories and present an overview of their defensive accolades.\n\nLeBron James\n\nJames has always been a prime-time defender. His defense peaked during his late Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat days. He made the first All-NBA Defensive Teams from 2009 to 2013. In fact, in 2008-09, the Cavs Forward finished second to 3x DPOY Dwight Howard in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. While in the 2012-13 season, another Center Marc Gasol nabbed the award from the Heat’s Two-Way phenom as he finished with 18 votes compared to Gasol’s 31. In 2014, LeBron made his last All-NBA defensive team when he was selected to the second team.\n\nIn terms of All-Time Defensive Win Shares, James is 11th on the list with 79.88 DWS. His defensive rating is placed at an impressive 104.4, just above his former Lakers teammate Dwight Howard. For his career, the four-time NBA Champion has captured around 1.5 steals per game. His best season was his sophomore season when he clinched 2.2 steals per game.\n\nAs a premier shot-blocker, James has notched 0.7 blocks per game, going over 1 block a game four times. His chase-down blocks are revered across generations. His block against Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals that denied the Warriors a lead remains one of the most historic ones ever.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan is one of the best perimeter defenders to play the game. MJ made 9X All-NBA Defensive Teams and even won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1988. In terms of Defensive Win Shares, Jordan is 21st All-Time with 64.13. The Guard had a defensive rating of 102.7. He was the league’s steals leader thrice in his career.\n\nMJ finished his career, notching an impressive 2.3 steals per game and is fourth all-time in the steals-per-game department. The six-time NBA Champion was also an impressive shot-blocker, finishing with 0.8 blocks a game. He blocked more than a shot per game four times in his career.\n\nOne of the most iconic blocks for MJ came when he was with the Wizards. The Shooting Guard with massive hands had plucked the ball away from Bulls’ Ron Mercer while he was attempting a layup. It was as if the veteran guard snatched a rebound away from a player attempting the shot.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese comparisons again can’t make an objective argument for which player is a better defender. Even though some might give Jordan the edge, they have different profiles. Jordan was more of an on-ball defender but was equally adept at helping from the weak side. Meanwhile, James is one of the best help defenders while equally threatening in one-on-one situations. Both players have been among the best competitors so it is natural that their defense was top-notch. At any rate, this defensive comparison won’t move the needle in the GOAT debate. The more people talk about it, the muddier the water gets.\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level. It quite literally does not get better than that.\nNBA POSITIONAL RANKINGS: PG | SG | SF | PF | C\nLeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Regular season stats\nJames' longevity gives him the edge in total statistics but Jordan holds the edge in scoring average.

            "raw_content": "What's LeBron James' record in the NBA Finals? Comparing superstar forward's finals record to Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James has had a remarkable career so far, showing great longevity as he enters his 20th season in the NBA. James made his first playoff appearance during the 2005-06 season as a Cavalier.\n\nBack then, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished the regular season with a respectable 61% winning record. However, James’ playoff run was cut short, losing 4-3 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nJames came out hungry the following season, getting his revenge on the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He averaged 25.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over six games, including a 48-point performance in Game 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers won the series in six games but were swept by the fundamentalists – the San Antonio Spurs – in the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James’ four subsequent NBA Finals appearances came during his stint with the Miami Heat. Teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, James was in the NBA Finals again. However, the Dallas Mavericks came out on top in the 2011 Finals.\n\nJames was a dominant force in the following two seasons, leading his team in scoring, rebounds, and assists – in both the finals. The Miami Heat were crowned champions in 2012 & 2013, with James winning the Finals MVP in both editions.\n\nJames’ return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 sparked a new NBA Finals rivalry between them and the Golden State Warriors. They matched up in the NBA finals for four consecutive years, with LeBron James being crowned champion only once. After being swept by the Warriors in the 2018 NBA Finals, James took his services to the LA Lakers.\n\nLeBron's stint with the LA Lakers has been turbulent to say the least, given he’s made the playoffs in only two of his four seasons. Still, James did guide the Lakers to the championship in 2020.\n\nLeBron James’ NBA Finals record vs Michael Jordan’s\n\nCollectively, James has been in 10 NBA Finals, coming out victorious in four. He won the Finals MVP in all those editions, matching up as closely with his idol, Michael Jordan, as he could. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, has reached the NBA Finals just six times in his 15 seasons.\n\nHowever, Michael Jordan’s record in the NBA Finals is what sets him apart. Like James, Jordan was the top-performer in all his championship runs – earning the Finals MVP award in all six editions.\n\nBut Jordan was able to win the title in all six appearances – completing two three-peats. James’ winning percentage (40%) in the NBA Finals, taking nothing away from his efforts, will always be brought up in any comparison with Jordan.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Comparing Career Scoring Totals\n\nMitch Goldich | Mar 7, 2019\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points Wednesday in the Lakers' 115-99 loss to the Nuggets. It would likely go down as a forgettable result in a season heâd like to forget, save for one major news item: He passed Michael Jordan on the NBAâs all-time career scoring list.\n\nAs his 16th season winds down, LeBron has now racked up 32,311 points, even more than the 32,292 points MJ tallied in his 15 regular seasons. LeBron is now fourth all-time in scoring, trailing just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant.\n\nSo today is the day. I will personally make the case that determines which of these two players is better and we will all agree forever. OK, probably not. There are other places on the internet to read those kinds of takes today. Instead Iâll just present some graphs and charts to compare the scoring outputs from these two all-time greats.\n\n1. Total points by age\n\nHere are their career points scored, broken down by age. In this case age means their n-age season, basically the year they were n years old on February 1, which is the way Basketball-Reference displays ages.\n\nHere you can see the advantage LeBron gained by jumping to the league straight out of high school, as he banked 3,700 points at the same ages that had Jordan wearing Carolina blue.\n\nThen you can see MJ gaining on LeBron until his baseball years (outside of his second season, when he only played 18 games in 1985-86).\n\nNow at 34, LeBron is the same age Jordan was when he finished his Bulls career with a second three-peat.\n\n2. Total points by season\n\nThis graph is similar to the one above, but now we go by season instead of age. This takes out the advantage LeBron gets from starting younger and playing all the way through. Jordanâs trajectory is no longer stunted by taking the 1993-94 season off, though you can still see the 1995 year when he played just 17 games in his return from baseball.\n\nBy this measure, Jordan was ahead of LeBron when he hung them up after his Wizards stint.\n\n3. Points per game by age4. Points per game by season\n\nThese two graphs are the same as the first two, but instead of using cumulative career points, weâll use scoring average per game during those seasons.\n\nAgain, when Jordan isnât dinged for the seasons he missed, you can see that his scoring average per season was consistently higher for most of his career.\n\nThatâs true either way you break it down, although his scoring averages as a 38- and 39-year-old in Washington, his 14th and 15th seasons, show a noticeable dip.\n\n5. Breaking down field goals, free throws and three-pointers\n\nThese pie charts basically answer the question: How did they get their points? It shows the career breakdowns for both players, and the percentage of points that came from free throws, two-point field goals and three-pointers.\n\nTheir free throw output is very close; Jordan made 7,327 and LeBron has made 7,101.\n\nThe key difference is three-point shooting. James has made 1,714 three pointers, while Jordan made just 581. Of course thatâs a result of them being products of their era. Jordan was a career 32.7% three-point shooter, while James has made a slightly better 34.4%. If Jordan played today, three-point shooting would likely be a bigger emphasis of his gameâmore attempts and he probably would have gotten even better at it.\n\n6. Breaking down points by team\n\nOne of the key differences between their careers is that Jordan spent almost all of his with the Bulls, until his late run with the Wizards. Jordanâs most famous employer swap was from the Bulls to the Birmingham Barons and back, whereas LeBron left Cleveland for Miami, came back and then again moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThis graph simply shows how many points they scored in each of their NBA uniforms.\n\n7. Breaking down points by career stop\n\nIf youâd like to take the previous graph and break it down further, this time weâll consider each of LeBronâs stops in Cleveland separately. And while weâre at it, we can carve out Jordanâs pre-baseball and post-baseball eras in Chicago.\n\nHereâs their total output during each of the various chapters in their careers.\n\n8. Scoring leader race by season\n\nIn addition to scoring more per game and more per season relative to LeBron, one thing that stands out about Jordanâs career is the way that he dominated his peers in the scoring race.\n\nJordan led the NBA in total points 11 times, including every season from 1986-87 through 1997-98 when he wasnât playing baseball.\n\nLeBron finished second in total points in eight straight seasons from 2004-05 through 2011-12, finishing behind Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (3x), Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant (3x). He didnât lead the league in total points until last season, his first time playing 82 games.\n\nThis graph shows where they finished in the league scoring (total points, not per game), based on the number of times finishing in each spot.Â  Jordan led the league 11 times, every season of his career except the two shortened Bulls seasons and the two Wizards seasons. LeBron only has that one season leading the league, but he was consistently in the Top 5. In fact, his first season in L.A. is his only time out of the Top 10, largely because of how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nIf we used points per game to show where they stood among league leaders, the graph would look very similar. Jordanâs career scoring mark of 30.12 points per game is the all-time record, and MJ won the per game scoring title 10 times. LeBron's mark of 27.15 is fourth all-time, behind Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. (For now at least. It takes three decimal places to separate James and Durant, and LeBron actually leapfrogged KD on Wednesday.)\n\nBut again, none of this is to say that Jordan was better than LeBron. Or vice versa. They each have different careers, different skills and different stories. It would be just as simplistic to boil their entire careers down to total points as it is to reduce their careers down to championship rings. They both deserve to be appreciated for what theyâve done, and on a day thatâs natural to compare their scoring output itâs fun to compare their careers in a few different ways.\n\nMitch Goldich is a senior editor for Sports Illustrated, mostly focused on the NFL.

And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game. Jordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements.",

            "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "LeBron James Crushes Michael Jordan In Key Stats\n\nThe eternal debate over basketball’s greatest of all time frequently narrows down to two luminaries: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  Jordan, with his six championship rings, epitomized dominance in the ’90s, setting a virtually unparalleled standard.\n\nMeanwhile, LeBron’s unique blend of athleticism and versatility redefines what prolonged excellence looks like in the NBA.  Both icons have built near-impenetrable legacies.\n\nSo, if we delve into the numbers—championships, MVPs, and more—who truly claims the record books?\n\nNBA Championships\n\nLeBron’s quartet of championships highlights his exceptional ability to adapt and lead, having clinched titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers.  Yet, the lingering narrative of his 4-6 NBA Finals record points to the struggles he faced in securing wins when the stakes were at their highest.\n\nOn the flip side, Jordan’s six-for-six in Finals appearances with the Bulls remains the gold standard.  His undefeated Finals record stands as a monument to his peerless capacity to deliver during basketball’s most crucial moments.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-1\n\nFinals MVPs\n\nHere, LeBron’s talent for taking center stage during the NBA’s grandest series shines through, with noteworthy performances like his near triple-double series in 2016. Yet, for Jordan, every championship came paired with a Finals MVP—showcasing time and again his ability to outshine all competitors on the brightest stage.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-2\n\nRegular Season MVPs\n\nLeBron’s run of MVPs underscores his all-around impact and consistent brilliance, although he frequently found himself snubbed perhaps due to voter fatigue. For Jordan, five MVP accolades marked his reign as the unequivocal king of two Chicago Bulls dynasties, reinforcing his long-held status as the best in the league.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-3\n\nScoring Titles\n\nWhile LeBron excels as a scorer, his focus on all-around play resulted in just one scoring title. Though, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time leading scorer didn’t require him to lead the league every year. Jordan, however, amassed ten scoring titles, with seven consecutive at his zenith, cementing his status as an unparalleled offensive juggernaut.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 0-4\n\nAssist Titles\n\nShowcasing his playmaking prowess, LeBron led the league in assists in 2020, illustrating his capability to quarterback an entire offense. Jordan’s role rarely required him to serve as the principal facilitator, although he remained adept in creating plays when necessary.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 1-4\n\nAll-NBA Selections\n\nLeBron’s 20 selections not only reflect his rarefied skill but also underscore his longevity. Remaining one of the top players over two decades is an unprecedented accomplishment. Meanwhile, Jordan’s 11 honors, achieved in a shorter span, were packed with exceptional dominance, each season testimony to his status as the league’s premier player.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 2-4\n\nAll-Star Selections\n\nLeBron’s 21 All-Star appearances further emphasize his enduring relevance and adaptability amidst evolving league dynamics. Jordan’s 14 All-Star nods, though fewer, affirm his perennial impact, with court performances that turned the exhibition into prime-time must-watch events.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 3-4\n\nAll-Star Game MVPs\n\nIn the spotlight of All-Star weekend, both icons displayed their exceptional skills, each capturing three MVP titles. LeBron dazzled with flair and dominance while remaining a crowd-pleaser. Jordan approached these games with a competitive spirit, famously engaging in a memorable clash with Kobe Bryant in 1998.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-5\n\nAll-Defensive Team Selections\n\nWhile LeBron has been formidable defensively during stretches, especially in Miami, his collective accolades don’t rival his offensive feats. Jordan’s defense was relentless, earning him nine First Team selections and reinforcing his all-around excellence.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-6\n\nDefensive Player of the Year Awards\n\nDefensive dominance is epitomized by Jordan’s 1988 DPOY award, a year in which he also led the league in scoring. It remains one of the most remarkable dual achievements in NBA history.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 4-7\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nBoth athletes burst onto the scene, immediately transforming their teams. LeBron’s debut season hinted at greatness as he elevated a lackluster Cavaliers squad, while Jordan’s 28.2 points per game as a rookie previewed the prolific scorer he would become.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 5-8\n\nTotal Win Shares\n\nIn terms of win shares, LeBron’s substantial total illustrates his long-term influence on team success, with his versatile skill set contributing to victory over a prolonged career. Jordan, while behind in total count, boasted immense per-season impact amplified by his legendary playoff performances.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-8\n\nCareer Player Efficiency Rating (PER)\n\nLeBron’s exceptional PER underscores his comprehensive performance levels across every statistical measure. Yet Jordan’s slight edge in this metric highlights his superior efficiency during fewer seasons, a testament to his unparalleled dominance.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: 6-9\n\nNBA Cup Titles\n\nLeBron etched his name once more into the history books by securing the first-ever NBA Cup, adding another facet to his illustrious career.\n\nIn the expansive realm of basketball debate, the ledger leans towards Jordan. However, this ongoing discourse reminds us how each titan has left an indelible mark on the game, and, perhaps, greatness can indeed wear different forms.\n\nLatest Miami Heat News & Rumors To Your Inbox\n\nStart your day with latest Miami Heat news and rumors in your inbox.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James Vs Michael Jordan: Who Was the Better Defender Between the Two GOAT Candidates?\n\nShubham Singh|PublishedJan 30, 2024\n\nCredits- USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NBA community is obsessed with the GOAT debate. Usually, the choice boils down to the two NBA legends, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Since most fans are generally interested in the two players’ contributions on the offensive end, their extraordinary defensive contributions can be often overlooked. Therefore, one interesting way of looking into the GOAT debate can be by examining Jordan and LeBron’s defensive numbers and accomplishments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo simplify the arguments, one can deploy the usage of defensive win shares and defensive rating as the predominant stats. Defensive win shares is an advanced stat that requires complex calculations. This thorough indicator takes into account the minutes played by the player and the team, league points per possession, defensive rating, and a bunch of other stats that provide a condensed fraction. Simply speaking, the higher a player’s defensive win shares, the more contributions a player has made defensively to the team.\n\nConversely, when it comes to defensive rating, a lower number is desirable. The defensive rating is measured by how many points a player allows per 100 possessions. Let us take a look at how LeBron James and Michael Jordan do in these two categories and present an overview of their defensive accolades.\n\nLeBron James\n\nJames has always been a prime-time defender. His defense peaked during his late Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat days. He made the first All-NBA Defensive Teams from 2009 to 2013. In fact, in 2008-09, the Cavs Forward finished second to 3x DPOY Dwight Howard in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. While in the 2012-13 season, another Center Marc Gasol nabbed the award from the Heat’s Two-Way phenom as he finished with 18 votes compared to Gasol’s 31. In 2014, LeBron made his last All-NBA defensive team when he was selected to the second team.\n\nIn terms of All-Time Defensive Win Shares, James is 11th on the list with 79.88 DWS. His defensive rating is placed at an impressive 104.4, just above his former Lakers teammate Dwight Howard. For his career, the four-time NBA Champion has captured around 1.5 steals per game. His best season was his sophomore season when he clinched 2.2 steals per game.\n\nAs a premier shot-blocker, James has notched 0.7 blocks per game, going over 1 block a game four times. His chase-down blocks are revered across generations. His block against Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals that denied the Warriors a lead remains one of the most historic ones ever.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan is one of the best perimeter defenders to play the game. MJ made 9X All-NBA Defensive Teams and even won the Defensive Player of the Year Award in 1988. In terms of Defensive Win Shares, Jordan is 21st All-Time with 64.13. The Guard had a defensive rating of 102.7. He was the league’s steals leader thrice in his career.\n\nMJ finished his career, notching an impressive 2.3 steals per game and is fourth all-time in the steals-per-game department. The six-time NBA Champion was also an impressive shot-blocker, finishing with 0.8 blocks a game. He blocked more than a shot per game four times in his career.\n\nOne of the most iconic blocks for MJ came when he was with the Wizards. The Shooting Guard with massive hands had plucked the ball away from Bulls’ Ron Mercer while he was attempting a layup. It was as if the veteran guard snatched a rebound away from a player attempting the shot.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese comparisons again can’t make an objective argument for which player is a better defender. Even though some might give Jordan the edge, they have different profiles. Jordan was more of an on-ball defender but was equally adept at helping from the weak side. Meanwhile, James is one of the best help defenders while equally threatening in one-on-one situations. Both players have been among the best competitors so it is natural that their defense was top-notch. At any rate, this defensive comparison won’t move the needle in the GOAT debate. The more people talk about it, the muddier the water gets.\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level. It quite literally does not get better than that.\nNBA POSITIONAL RANKINGS: PG | SG | SF | PF | C\nLeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Regular season stats\nJames' longevity gives him the edge in total statistics but Jordan holds the edge in scoring average.
