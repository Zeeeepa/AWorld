One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times.

He lost one series as the favorite (2011 vs. Dallas) but led his teams to a pair of series wins as the oddsmakers’ underdog (2012 vs. Oklahoma City and 2016 vs. Golden State, when Cleveland memorably erased a 3-1 deficit to beat the 73-9 record-setting Warriors).\n\nJames … Category … Jordan\n\n4 … NBA championships … 6\n\n4-6 … NBA Finals record … 6-0\n\n4 … Finals MVPs … 6\n\n4 … Regular-season MVPs … 5\n\n18 … All-NBA teams … 11\n\n6 … All-Defense teams … 9\n\n0 … Defensive POY … 1\n\n19 … All-Star teams … 14\n\n1 … Scoring titles … 10\n\n3 (1 bronze) … Olympic medals … 2\n\nRelated Articles\n\nShare this:\n\nMost Popular\n\nDisneyland pauses all Magic Key sales again — this time with a twist\n\n5 high school or younger students among those in deadly Santa Ana crash\n\nIn Santa Ana crash that killed 4, 5th on life support\n\nOwner of beachfront oil, natural gas property in Huntington Beach proposes 800-unit housing development\n\nRock and Brews closes Tustin location after five years\n\nOC Parks Summer Concert Series returns with free live music in 2025\n\nWant a CD paying 6% or more?

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The Chicago Bulls posed a serious threat to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n#TBT to when LeBron James hit a game-winning buzzer-beater over Jimmy Butler and the Bulls in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semis. pic.twitter.com/VurMVnw3oz\n\nIn Game 4, with the scores tied at 84-84 and with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, LeBron James hit a deep 2 from the corner over Jimmy Butler to help Cleveland level the series. The Cavs went on to win the series 4-2 and reached the NBA Finals that year.\n\n#4. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost the Game 1 against the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOn this date in 2009, LeBron James hit his 1st playoff buzzer-beater to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a 96-95 win over the Orlando Magic in Game 2 of the '09 Eastern Conf. Finals.Orlando, however, would go on to win the series in 6 games. pic.twitter.com/tOZJzfFLPN\n\nDown 2 points in Game 2 with just 1 second left, the Cavaliers were at the risk of going down 0-2 in the series. LeBron James collected an inbound pass a few feet outside the 3-point line and nailed a high-arcing shot to beat the buzzer.\n\nThough Magic went on to win the series in 6, this buzzer-beater from James remains one of the most memorable moments of his storied career.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: The dream starting 5 for the Portland Trail Blazers going into the 2020-21 season\n\n#3. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers, First Round, Game 5, 2018\n\nIn 2018, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers came closer than ever to upsetting the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, Oladipo had the ball in his hand with the scores tied at 95.\n\n.@KingJames WINS IT AT THE BUZZER! 🚨😱Pacers vs. Cavaliers, 2018 Eastern Conference 1st Round Game 5 - 2pm ET on NBA TV! pic.twitter.com/88wPXvteqp\n\nWhat happened next remains as one of the best sequence of plays ever on both ends of the court. LeBron James blocked a layup attempt with 3 seconds left on the clock and drilled a deep 3 to beat the buzzer on the other side. The Cavaliers went on to win the series in 7 games.\n\n#2. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2013\n\nThe Miami Heat were one game away from winning back-to-back NBA championships in 2013. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, there was nothing to split the teams up until 3 quarters.\n\n7 years ago today, LeBron did this to the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals! 37 PTS5-10 3PT12 REB4 AST2 STLBack-to-back champs! pic.twitter.com/ccoz02gUll\n\nLeBron James took over in the final quarter as he went on to score 16 points in the final 12 minutes. He went 7-11 in the quarter, and also hit a clutch jumper to extend Miami's lead to 4 points with just 28 seconds left on the clock.\n\n#1. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2016\n\nCleveland Cavaliers pulled off the impossible in 2016 against the mighty Golden State Warriors. After being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, the Cavs came back all guns blazing and won the next 3 games to win their first title in franchise history.\n\nLeBron’s block, Kyrie’s dagger, Cleveland’s title. 🏆Game 7 of the 2016 Finals was epic.

The Warriors' Andre Iguodala was about the give them the lead in what seemed like an easy layup at the rim.\n\nThis is when LeBron James made an incredible run from the other side of the court, and leaped as high as anyone could to block the shot off the backboard.

          "raw_content": "Breaking Down LeBron James' Performance in the Clutch by the Numbers\n\n\n\nEven if his peers don't think so, LeBron James should be synonymous with \"clutch\" at this point in his NBA career.\n\nNumbers don't lie, and they all support his greatness when the clock is ticking down.\n\nAll the players in the ESPN The Magazine poll who decided they'd rather have Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan taking the last shot in a close game should do a little bit more digging into those numbers—then submit their votes again. The results would be a little different, even if nearly a quarter of the anonymous, 26-player poll thought that LeBron would go down as the greatest player of all time.\n\nLeBron's battle against the clutch has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years—Dan Favale has a great piece on his evolution here at B/R—but there's no more room for debate. He thrives when the going gets tough.\n\nDeciding Shots with the Shot Clock Turned Off\n\nBefore expanding the definition of \"clutch\" to include more types of plays, let's first take a look at what happens on shots to either tie or take the lead during the final 24 seconds of either the fourth quarter or an overtime period.\n\nIs there any moment more crucial? The ball is in a player's hands, and he has the opportunity to either ensure victory or defeat. According to Miami Heat beat writer Tim Reynolds, LeBron was pretty darn good in those situations.\n\nNot only did he make the most shots—far more than a certain member of the Los Angeles Lakers—but he also shot 41.2 percent from the field. You have to re-contextualize here, as defensive intensity ramps up in these situations. A lower field-goal percentage is to be expected when the game is on the line, and it should be rather telling that only Kevin Durant's mark beat LeBron's.\n\nBut these players aren't the only ones who can take game-deciding shots. They can also pass the ball to teammates and have them do the dirty work. It's a concept that not too many superstars are familiar with, as \"hero ball\" has unfortunately taken over as the method du jour when the contest is on the line.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of a game in which the player's team was tied or behind by three points or fewer, no one in the NBA recorded more assists than LeBron. He, Nicolas Batum and Andre Miller each produced four assists, and LeBron did so while keeping his sheet free from any of those pesky little turnovers.\n\nPaul Pierce was the only other player from Reynolds' tweet to avoid a goose egg in the assist column, and he checked in with two dimes.\n\nThe league MVP is already at the forefront of the discussion when isolating scoring, but he pulls ahead by an even wider margin as soon as his elite passing is brought into the conversation. During the 2012-13 season, you wanted the ball in his hands when the game was truly on the line.\n\nBut now let's expand the definition of clutch to be much more inclusive, thus raising the sample size enough to draw more conclusions.\n\nRaises Performance During the Final Minutes of Close Games\n\nI wrote a recent article about why it's so important Dwyane Wade fully cedes the alpha-dog role to his talented teammate, but it's worth bringing up again.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, there are going to be two different definitions of clutch. \"Clutch 1\" will be considered the last five minutes of a game when teams are separated by five points or fewer, and \"Clutch 2\" will be the last 30 seconds of a one-possession game, regardless of which team was ahead at the time.\n\nIf you look at per-36-minute numbers, LeBron has consistently raised his game as the going gets tougher:\n\nAssuming that you could extrapolate his Clutch 2 numbers to a full 36 minutes of action (an admittedly faulty assumption since things change in a one-possession game), LeBron would put up a triple-double while scoring over 60 points. That's pure insanity.\n\nLebron James' per-36-minute numbers are impressive enough over the course of a contest. But when we enter into Clutch 1 and Clutch 2 situations, he just goes berserk. He scores with reckless abandon—especially when he decides to start attacking the rim—gets everyone involved, and crashes the boards with a fury.\n\nNo one else does that to the same extent. And the trend carries over to the postseason as well. In Clutch 1 situations, LeBron averaged 26.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 11.5 assists per 36 minutes while shooting 44 percent from the field. All of the counting stats are higher than his normal playoff numbers, and the field-goal percentage was only slightly lower.\n\nHowever, in Clutch 2 situations during last year's postseason, he completely changed his style of play. He met the criteria in six games, and while he didn't record a single rebound or assist, he did manage to average 55.2 points per 36 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThere was just no decline.\n\nTriple-Double and Game-Winner in the Postseason\n\nAnd speaking of the postseason, how about the fact that LeBron is the only player to record both a triple-double and hit a game-winner in the same playoff game, as he did against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe truly made history when he beat Paul George to the hoop for a relatively easy left-handed layup last Eastern Conference Finals, cementing his legacy as a player who could come up big when the moments got tougher.\n\nNow for the rest of this article, I'm going to be changing the definition of \"clutch\" once more. Throughout each of the next three sections, it will be defined as the last five minutes of a game when the contest is separated by less than five points, and only players who met those criteria in at least 10 games (while playing two or more minutes per contest) during 2012-13 will be included.\n\nIt's a rather broad definition, but, again, it's a necessary one so that we can have at least a fairly substantial sample size.\n\nAcross-the-Board Greatness\n\nOne of the things that makes LeBron so special is his impact in all major categories during the closing minutes of a game. In fact, no player has as big of an across-the-board impact.\n\nObviously, it's hard to play a lot of minutes in this type of clutch situation because, by definition, it's just five minutes in any game unless there's an overtime or two. So keep that in mind when you see numbers that are far lower than you might expect.\n\nLeBron didn't score the most points per game in this type of clutch situation, but he wasn't far off the mark.\n\nThat wasn't the only area in which he excelled, even if Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving were the only ones in the above graph with higher field-goal percentages. LeBron also crashed the boards quite often during the closing minutes of tight games.\n\nThink we're done yet? Think again. Assists matter too!\n\nLeBron and Rajon Rondo were in a league of their own when it came to passing the ball during the closing stretch of a tight game. They were both willing and able to find openings in the suffocating defenses thrown at them, and the rest of the league just wasn't even close.\n\nNow, how many of the 15 names are repeats? The answer is rather simple: only one.\n\nLeBron appears on all three graphs, and no other player in the NBA finds himself on more than a single top-five leaderboard. He's an elite scorer, rebounder and distributor when the pressure cooker is turned up to its highest notch.\n\nLiterally, no one else can say that. And did this change in the postseason? Of course not!\n\nOnce the playoffs rolled around, the Heat star finished No. 1 in clutch scoring, No. 4 in rebounding (behind Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw), and No. 7 in assists (trailing Kirk Hinrich, Russell Westbrook, Josh Smith, Manu Ginobili, Mike Conley and Luol Deng).\n\nStill pretty darn elite.\n\nPIE vs. Winning Percentage\n\nPlayer impact estimate (PIE) hasn't entered the collective consciousness of NBA fans yet, but it's a wonderful tool used by NBA.com to show how involved a player is. Instead of usage rate, which omits assists, rebounds and anything that doesn't finish a play, PIE \"measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in.\"\n\nDuring clutch situations, no player had a higher PIE than LeBron's 29.7. He was just ultra-involved in the contest at all times, more so than Kobe Bryant (26.5), Kevin Durant (24.3), James Harden (23.3) and everyone else.\n\nBut, that's only good if it results in success. Being highly involved can be a bad thing if wins aren't the result.\n\nFor that reason, I've put together this graph, which correlates PIE (X-axis) with winning percentage (Y-axis) for the 20 most \"involved\" players in the NBA:\n\nThat's a pretty telling image, as LeBron both had the highest winning percentage and the most involvement. He's the dot in the top right, and he's joined at 80 percent on the Y-axis by his teammate, Chris Bosh.\n\nNo one else is close in either category. But now, let's break it down even further and look at his involvement in the Heat's scoring plays.\n\nInvolvement in Scoring Plays\n\nTwo new stats are relevant here: percent assisted and percent field goals made.\n\nThe former represents the number of made shots by teammates that were assisted by the player in question when he was on the court, and the latter shows the percentage of made field goals credited to the player when he was playing.\n\nAt this point, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that LeBron James was elite in both categories during crunch time among those who played at least 20 games that met the parameters.\n\nIn fact, he finished fifth in percent assisted, behind only Ricky Rubio, Rajon Rondo, Will Bynum and Raymond Felton. As for percent field goals made, he was significantly lower, but still doing pretty well for himself with at 15th.\n\nBut let's take this a step beyond and combine the two to show overall involvement in scoring plays, something that I'm just going to call percent scoring. It's calculated rather easily, just by adding percent assisted to percent field goals made.\n\nAs you might expect, LeBron is right near the top of the leaderboard:\n\nLeBron and Kobe should stand out to you. The rest are all point guards—yes, that's Will Bynum benefiting from a small sample size, not Andrew Bynum—which makes sense, because floor generals are naturally more involved in the playmaking.\n\nThere's also a major benefit gained from being a superstar on a lackluster team. That's giving Kyrie Irving and Jrue Holiday an artificial boost, as there simply weren't other intriguing options on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.\n\nFor those reasons, you should be most impressed by LeBron, Kobe and CP3, considering their teammates.\n\nAnd across the board, you should just be in awe of how great LeBron is with the game on the line. Although there's already a large gap between him and the rest of the league no matter how much time is left on the clock, there's an even larger disparity when nearing the final buzzer in a tight game.\n\nHis scoring prowess, willingness to make the right play, and consistent ability to come out on top make him stand out in a big way.\n\nGo ahead—keep denying LeBron's ability to come up big when it counts. The rest of us will be over here trying to contain our laughter.\n\nNote: All stats, unless otherwise indicated, come from NBA.com's statistical databases, and all graphics were created with Infogr.am.\n\n"

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times.

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The Chicago Bulls posed a serious threat to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n#TBT to when LeBron James hit a game-winning buzzer-beater over Jimmy Butler and the Bulls in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semis. pic.twitter.com/VurMVnw3oz\n\nIn Game 4, with the scores tied at 84-84 and with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, LeBron James hit a deep 2 from the corner over Jimmy Butler to help Cleveland level the series. The Cavs went on to win the series 4-2 and reached the NBA Finals that year.\n\n#4. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost the Game 1 against the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOn this date in 2009, LeBron James hit his 1st playoff buzzer-beater to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a 96-95 win over the Orlando Magic in Game 2 of the '09 Eastern Conf. Finals.Orlando, however, would go on to win the series in 6 games. pic.twitter.com/tOZJzfFLPN\n\nDown 2 points in Game 2 with just 1 second left, the Cavaliers were at the risk of going down 0-2 in the series. LeBron James collected an inbound pass a few feet outside the 3-point line and nailed a high-arcing shot to beat the buzzer.\n\nThough Magic went on to win the series in 6, this buzzer-beater from James remains one of the most memorable moments of his storied career.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: The dream starting 5 for the Portland Trail Blazers going into the 2020-21 season\n\n#3. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers, First Round, Game 5, 2018\n\nIn 2018, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers came closer than ever to upsetting the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, Oladipo had the ball in his hand with the scores tied at 95.\n\n.@KingJames WINS IT AT THE BUZZER! 🚨😱Pacers vs. Cavaliers, 2018 Eastern Conference 1st Round Game 5 - 2pm ET on NBA TV! pic.twitter.com/88wPXvteqp\n\nWhat happened next remains as one of the best sequence of plays ever on both ends of the court. LeBron James blocked a layup attempt with 3 seconds left on the clock and drilled a deep 3 to beat the buzzer on the other side. The Cavaliers went on to win the series in 7 games.\n\n#2. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2013\n\nThe Miami Heat were one game away from winning back-to-back NBA championships in 2013. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, there was nothing to split the teams up until 3 quarters.\n\n7 years ago today, LeBron did this to the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals! 37 PTS5-10 3PT12 REB4 AST2 STLBack-to-back champs! pic.twitter.com/ccoz02gUll\n\nLeBron James took over in the final quarter as he went on to score 16 points in the final 12 minutes. He went 7-11 in the quarter, and also hit a clutch jumper to extend Miami's lead to 4 points with just 28 seconds left on the clock.\n\n#1. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2016\n\nCleveland Cavaliers pulled off the impossible in 2016 against the mighty Golden State Warriors. After being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, the Cavs came back all guns blazing and won the next 3 games to win their first title in franchise history.\n\nLeBron’s block, Kyrie’s dagger, Cleveland’s title. 🏆Game 7 of the 2016 Finals was epic.

The Warriors' Andre Iguodala was about the give them the lead in what seemed like an easy layup at the rim.\n\nThis is when LeBron James made an incredible run from the other side of the court, and leaped as high as anyone could to block the shot off the backboard.

            "raw_content": "Breaking Down LeBron James' Performance in the Clutch by the Numbers\n\n\n\nEven if his peers don't think so, LeBron James should be synonymous with \"clutch\" at this point in his NBA career.\n\nNumbers don't lie, and they all support his greatness when the clock is ticking down.\n\nAll the players in the ESPN The Magazine poll who decided they'd rather have Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan taking the last shot in a close game should do a little bit more digging into those numbers—then submit their votes again. The results would be a little different, even if nearly a quarter of the anonymous, 26-player poll thought that LeBron would go down as the greatest player of all time.\n\nLeBron's battle against the clutch has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years—Dan Favale has a great piece on his evolution here at B/R—but there's no more room for debate. He thrives when the going gets tough.\n\nDeciding Shots with the Shot Clock Turned Off\n\nBefore expanding the definition of \"clutch\" to include more types of plays, let's first take a look at what happens on shots to either tie or take the lead during the final 24 seconds of either the fourth quarter or an overtime period.\n\nIs there any moment more crucial? The ball is in a player's hands, and he has the opportunity to either ensure victory or defeat. According to Miami Heat beat writer Tim Reynolds, LeBron was pretty darn good in those situations.\n\nNot only did he make the most shots—far more than a certain member of the Los Angeles Lakers—but he also shot 41.2 percent from the field. You have to re-contextualize here, as defensive intensity ramps up in these situations. A lower field-goal percentage is to be expected when the game is on the line, and it should be rather telling that only Kevin Durant's mark beat LeBron's.\n\nBut these players aren't the only ones who can take game-deciding shots. They can also pass the ball to teammates and have them do the dirty work. It's a concept that not too many superstars are familiar with, as \"hero ball\" has unfortunately taken over as the method du jour when the contest is on the line.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of a game in which the player's team was tied or behind by three points or fewer, no one in the NBA recorded more assists than LeBron. He, Nicolas Batum and Andre Miller each produced four assists, and LeBron did so while keeping his sheet free from any of those pesky little turnovers.\n\nPaul Pierce was the only other player from Reynolds' tweet to avoid a goose egg in the assist column, and he checked in with two dimes.\n\nThe league MVP is already at the forefront of the discussion when isolating scoring, but he pulls ahead by an even wider margin as soon as his elite passing is brought into the conversation. During the 2012-13 season, you wanted the ball in his hands when the game was truly on the line.\n\nBut now let's expand the definition of clutch to be much more inclusive, thus raising the sample size enough to draw more conclusions.\n\nRaises Performance During the Final Minutes of Close Games\n\nI wrote a recent article about why it's so important Dwyane Wade fully cedes the alpha-dog role to his talented teammate, but it's worth bringing up again.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, there are going to be two different definitions of clutch. \"Clutch 1\" will be considered the last five minutes of a game when teams are separated by five points or fewer, and \"Clutch 2\" will be the last 30 seconds of a one-possession game, regardless of which team was ahead at the time.\n\nIf you look at per-36-minute numbers, LeBron has consistently raised his game as the going gets tougher:\n\nAssuming that you could extrapolate his Clutch 2 numbers to a full 36 minutes of action (an admittedly faulty assumption since things change in a one-possession game), LeBron would put up a triple-double while scoring over 60 points. That's pure insanity.\n\nLebron James' per-36-minute numbers are impressive enough over the course of a contest. But when we enter into Clutch 1 and Clutch 2 situations, he just goes berserk. He scores with reckless abandon—especially when he decides to start attacking the rim—gets everyone involved, and crashes the boards with a fury.\n\nNo one else does that to the same extent. And the trend carries over to the postseason as well. In Clutch 1 situations, LeBron averaged 26.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 11.5 assists per 36 minutes while shooting 44 percent from the field. All of the counting stats are higher than his normal playoff numbers, and the field-goal percentage was only slightly lower.\n\nHowever, in Clutch 2 situations during last year's postseason, he completely changed his style of play. He met the criteria in six games, and while he didn't record a single rebound or assist, he did manage to average 55.2 points per 36 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThere was just no decline.\n\nTriple-Double and Game-Winner in the Postseason\n\nAnd speaking of the postseason, how about the fact that LeBron is the only player to record both a triple-double and hit a game-winner in the same playoff game, as he did against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe truly made history when he beat Paul George to the hoop for a relatively easy left-handed layup last Eastern Conference Finals, cementing his legacy as a player who could come up big when the moments got tougher.\n\nNow for the rest of this article, I'm going to be changing the definition of \"clutch\" once more. Throughout each of the next three sections, it will be defined as the last five minutes of a game when the contest is separated by less than five points, and only players who met those criteria in at least 10 games (while playing two or more minutes per contest) during 2012-13 will be included.\n\nIt's a rather broad definition, but, again, it's a necessary one so that we can have at least a fairly substantial sample size.\n\nAcross-the-Board Greatness\n\nOne of the things that makes LeBron so special is his impact in all major categories during the closing minutes of a game. In fact, no player has as big of an across-the-board impact.\n\nObviously, it's hard to play a lot of minutes in this type of clutch situation because, by definition, it's just five minutes in any game unless there's an overtime or two. So keep that in mind when you see numbers that are far lower than you might expect.\n\nLeBron didn't score the most points per game in this type of clutch situation, but he wasn't far off the mark.\n\nThat wasn't the only area in which he excelled, even if Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving were the only ones in the above graph with higher field-goal percentages. LeBron also crashed the boards quite often during the closing minutes of tight games.\n\nThink we're done yet? Think again. Assists matter too!\n\nLeBron and Rajon Rondo were in a league of their own when it came to passing the ball during the closing stretch of a tight game. They were both willing and able to find openings in the suffocating defenses thrown at them, and the rest of the league just wasn't even close.\n\nNow, how many of the 15 names are repeats? The answer is rather simple: only one.\n\nLeBron appears on all three graphs, and no other player in the NBA finds himself on more than a single top-five leaderboard. He's an elite scorer, rebounder and distributor when the pressure cooker is turned up to its highest notch.\n\nLiterally, no one else can say that. And did this change in the postseason? Of course not!\n\nOnce the playoffs rolled around, the Heat star finished No. 1 in clutch scoring, No. 4 in rebounding (behind Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw), and No. 7 in assists (trailing Kirk Hinrich, Russell Westbrook, Josh Smith, Manu Ginobili, Mike Conley and Luol Deng).\n\nStill pretty darn elite.\n\nPIE vs. Winning Percentage\n\nPlayer impact estimate (PIE) hasn't entered the collective consciousness of NBA fans yet, but it's a wonderful tool used by NBA.com to show how involved a player is. Instead of usage rate, which omits assists, rebounds and anything that doesn't finish a play, PIE \"measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in.\"\n\nDuring clutch situations, no player had a higher PIE than LeBron's 29.7. He was just ultra-involved in the contest at all times, more so than Kobe Bryant (26.5), Kevin Durant (24.3), James Harden (23.3) and everyone else.\n\nBut, that's only good if it results in success. Being highly involved can be a bad thing if wins aren't the result.\n\nFor that reason, I've put together this graph, which correlates PIE (X-axis) with winning percentage (Y-axis) for the 20 most \"involved\" players in the NBA:\n\nThat's a pretty telling image, as LeBron both had the highest winning percentage and the most involvement. He's the dot in the top right, and he's joined at 80 percent on the Y-axis by his teammate, Chris Bosh.\n\nNo one else is close in either category. But now, let's break it down even further and look at his involvement in the Heat's scoring plays.\n\nInvolvement in Scoring Plays\n\nTwo new stats are relevant here: percent assisted and percent field goals made.\n\nThe former represents the number of made shots by teammates that were assisted by the player in question when he was on the court, and the latter shows the percentage of made field goals credited to the player when he was playing.\n\nAt this point, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that LeBron James was elite in both categories during crunch time among those who played at least 20 games that met the parameters.\n\nIn fact, he finished fifth in percent assisted, behind only Ricky Rubio, Rajon Rondo, Will Bynum and Raymond Felton. As for percent field goals made, he was significantly lower, but still doing pretty well for himself with at 15th.\n\nBut let's take this a step beyond and combine the two to show overall involvement in scoring plays, something that I'm just going to call percent scoring. It's calculated rather easily, just by adding percent assisted to percent field goals made.\n\nAs you might expect, LeBron is right near the top of the leaderboard:\n\nLeBron and Kobe should stand out to you. The rest are all point guards—yes, that's Will Bynum benefiting from a small sample size, not Andrew Bynum—which makes sense, because floor generals are naturally more involved in the playmaking.\n\nThere's also a major benefit gained from being a superstar on a lackluster team. That's giving Kyrie Irving and Jrue Holiday an artificial boost, as there simply weren't other intriguing options on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.\n\nFor those reasons, you should be most impressed by LeBron, Kobe and CP3, considering their teammates.\n\nAnd across the board, you should just be in awe of how great LeBron is with the game on the line. Although there's already a large gap between him and the rest of the league no matter how much time is left on the clock, there's an even larger disparity when nearing the final buzzer in a tight game.\n\nHis scoring prowess, willingness to make the right play, and consistent ability to come out on top make him stand out in a big way.\n\nGo ahead—keep denying LeBron's ability to come up big when it counts. The rest of us will be over here trying to contain our laughter.\n\nNote: All stats, unless otherwise indicated, come from NBA.com's statistical databases, and all graphics were created with Infogr.am.\n\n"

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.
