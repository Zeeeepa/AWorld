One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times.

He lost one series as the favorite (2011 vs. Dallas) but led his teams to a pair of series wins as the oddsmakers’ underdog (2012 vs. Oklahoma City and 2016 vs. Golden State, when Cleveland memorably erased a 3-1 deficit to beat the 73-9 record-setting Warriors).\n\nJames … Category … Jordan\n\n4 … NBA championships … 6\n\n4-6 … NBA Finals record … 6-0\n\n4 … Finals MVPs … 6\n\n4 … Regular-season MVPs … 5\n\n18 … All-NBA teams … 11\n\n6 … All-Defense teams … 9\n\n0 … Defensive POY … 1\n\n19 … All-Star teams … 14\n\n1 … Scoring titles … 10\n\n3 (1 bronze) … Olympic medals … 2\n\nRelated Articles\n\nShare this:\n\nMost Popular\n\nDisneyland pauses all Magic Key sales again — this time with a twist\n\n5 high school or younger students among those in deadly Santa Ana crash\n\nIn Santa Ana crash that killed 4, 5th on life support\n\nOwner of beachfront oil, natural gas property in Huntington Beach proposes 800-unit housing development\n\nRock and Brews closes Tustin location after five years\n\nOC Parks Summer Concert Series returns with free live music in 2025\n\nWant a CD paying 6% or more?

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The Chicago Bulls posed a serious threat to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n#TBT to when LeBron James hit a game-winning buzzer-beater over Jimmy Butler and the Bulls in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semis. pic.twitter.com/VurMVnw3oz\n\nIn Game 4, with the scores tied at 84-84 and with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, LeBron James hit a deep 2 from the corner over Jimmy Butler to help Cleveland level the series. The Cavs went on to win the series 4-2 and reached the NBA Finals that year.\n\n#4. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost the Game 1 against the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOn this date in 2009, LeBron James hit his 1st playoff buzzer-beater to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a 96-95 win over the Orlando Magic in Game 2 of the '09 Eastern Conf. Finals.Orlando, however, would go on to win the series in 6 games. pic.twitter.com/tOZJzfFLPN\n\nDown 2 points in Game 2 with just 1 second left, the Cavaliers were at the risk of going down 0-2 in the series. LeBron James collected an inbound pass a few feet outside the 3-point line and nailed a high-arcing shot to beat the buzzer.\n\nThough Magic went on to win the series in 6, this buzzer-beater from James remains one of the most memorable moments of his storied career.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: The dream starting 5 for the Portland Trail Blazers going into the 2020-21 season\n\n#3. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers, First Round, Game 5, 2018\n\nIn 2018, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers came closer than ever to upsetting the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, Oladipo had the ball in his hand with the scores tied at 95.\n\n.@KingJames WINS IT AT THE BUZZER! 🚨😱Pacers vs. Cavaliers, 2018 Eastern Conference 1st Round Game 5 - 2pm ET on NBA TV! pic.twitter.com/88wPXvteqp\n\nWhat happened next remains as one of the best sequence of plays ever on both ends of the court. LeBron James blocked a layup attempt with 3 seconds left on the clock and drilled a deep 3 to beat the buzzer on the other side. The Cavaliers went on to win the series in 7 games.\n\n#2. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2013\n\nThe Miami Heat were one game away from winning back-to-back NBA championships in 2013. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, there was nothing to split the teams up until 3 quarters.\n\n7 years ago today, LeBron did this to the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals! 37 PTS5-10 3PT12 REB4 AST2 STLBack-to-back champs! pic.twitter.com/ccoz02gUll\n\nLeBron James took over in the final quarter as he went on to score 16 points in the final 12 minutes. He went 7-11 in the quarter, and also hit a clutch jumper to extend Miami's lead to 4 points with just 28 seconds left on the clock.\n\n#1. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2016\n\nCleveland Cavaliers pulled off the impossible in 2016 against the mighty Golden State Warriors. After being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, the Cavs came back all guns blazing and won the next 3 games to win their first title in franchise history.\n\nLeBron’s block, Kyrie’s dagger, Cleveland’s title. 🏆Game 7 of the 2016 Finals was epic.

The Warriors' Andre Iguodala was about the give them the lead in what seemed like an easy layup at the rim.\n\nThis is when LeBron James made an incredible run from the other side of the court, and leaped as high as anyone could to block the shot off the backboard.

          "raw_content": "Breaking Down LeBron James' Performance in the Clutch by the Numbers\n\n\n\nEven if his peers don't think so, LeBron James should be synonymous with \"clutch\" at this point in his NBA career.\n\nNumbers don't lie, and they all support his greatness when the clock is ticking down.\n\nAll the players in the ESPN The Magazine poll who decided they'd rather have Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan taking the last shot in a close game should do a little bit more digging into those numbers—then submit their votes again. The results would be a little different, even if nearly a quarter of the anonymous, 26-player poll thought that LeBron would go down as the greatest player of all time.\n\nLeBron's battle against the clutch has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years—Dan Favale has a great piece on his evolution here at B/R—but there's no more room for debate. He thrives when the going gets tough.\n\nDeciding Shots with the Shot Clock Turned Off\n\nBefore expanding the definition of \"clutch\" to include more types of plays, let's first take a look at what happens on shots to either tie or take the lead during the final 24 seconds of either the fourth quarter or an overtime period.\n\nIs there any moment more crucial? The ball is in a player's hands, and he has the opportunity to either ensure victory or defeat. According to Miami Heat beat writer Tim Reynolds, LeBron was pretty darn good in those situations.\n\nNot only did he make the most shots—far more than a certain member of the Los Angeles Lakers—but he also shot 41.2 percent from the field. You have to re-contextualize here, as defensive intensity ramps up in these situations. A lower field-goal percentage is to be expected when the game is on the line, and it should be rather telling that only Kevin Durant's mark beat LeBron's.\n\nBut these players aren't the only ones who can take game-deciding shots. They can also pass the ball to teammates and have them do the dirty work. It's a concept that not too many superstars are familiar with, as \"hero ball\" has unfortunately taken over as the method du jour when the contest is on the line.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of a game in which the player's team was tied or behind by three points or fewer, no one in the NBA recorded more assists than LeBron. He, Nicolas Batum and Andre Miller each produced four assists, and LeBron did so while keeping his sheet free from any of those pesky little turnovers.\n\nPaul Pierce was the only other player from Reynolds' tweet to avoid a goose egg in the assist column, and he checked in with two dimes.\n\nThe league MVP is already at the forefront of the discussion when isolating scoring, but he pulls ahead by an even wider margin as soon as his elite passing is brought into the conversation. During the 2012-13 season, you wanted the ball in his hands when the game was truly on the line.\n\nBut now let's expand the definition of clutch to be much more inclusive, thus raising the sample size enough to draw more conclusions.\n\nRaises Performance During the Final Minutes of Close Games\n\nI wrote a recent article about why it's so important Dwyane Wade fully cedes the alpha-dog role to his talented teammate, but it's worth bringing up again.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, there are going to be two different definitions of clutch. \"Clutch 1\" will be considered the last five minutes of a game when teams are separated by five points or fewer, and \"Clutch 2\" will be the last 30 seconds of a one-possession game, regardless of which team was ahead at the time.\n\nIf you look at per-36-minute numbers, LeBron has consistently raised his game as the going gets tougher:\n\nAssuming that you could extrapolate his Clutch 2 numbers to a full 36 minutes of action (an admittedly faulty assumption since things change in a one-possession game), LeBron would put up a triple-double while scoring over 60 points. That's pure insanity.\n\nLebron James' per-36-minute numbers are impressive enough over the course of a contest. But when we enter into Clutch 1 and Clutch 2 situations, he just goes berserk. He scores with reckless abandon—especially when he decides to start attacking the rim—gets everyone involved, and crashes the boards with a fury.\n\nNo one else does that to the same extent. And the trend carries over to the postseason as well. In Clutch 1 situations, LeBron averaged 26.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 11.5 assists per 36 minutes while shooting 44 percent from the field. All of the counting stats are higher than his normal playoff numbers, and the field-goal percentage was only slightly lower.\n\nHowever, in Clutch 2 situations during last year's postseason, he completely changed his style of play. He met the criteria in six games, and while he didn't record a single rebound or assist, he did manage to average 55.2 points per 36 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThere was just no decline.\n\nTriple-Double and Game-Winner in the Postseason\n\nAnd speaking of the postseason, how about the fact that LeBron is the only player to record both a triple-double and hit a game-winner in the same playoff game, as he did against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe truly made history when he beat Paul George to the hoop for a relatively easy left-handed layup last Eastern Conference Finals, cementing his legacy as a player who could come up big when the moments got tougher.\n\nNow for the rest of this article, I'm going to be changing the definition of \"clutch\" once more. Throughout each of the next three sections, it will be defined as the last five minutes of a game when the contest is separated by less than five points, and only players who met those criteria in at least 10 games (while playing two or more minutes per contest) during 2012-13 will be included.\n\nIt's a rather broad definition, but, again, it's a necessary one so that we can have at least a fairly substantial sample size.\n\nAcross-the-Board Greatness\n\nOne of the things that makes LeBron so special is his impact in all major categories during the closing minutes of a game. In fact, no player has as big of an across-the-board impact.\n\nObviously, it's hard to play a lot of minutes in this type of clutch situation because, by definition, it's just five minutes in any game unless there's an overtime or two. So keep that in mind when you see numbers that are far lower than you might expect.\n\nLeBron didn't score the most points per game in this type of clutch situation, but he wasn't far off the mark.\n\nThat wasn't the only area in which he excelled, even if Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving were the only ones in the above graph with higher field-goal percentages. LeBron also crashed the boards quite often during the closing minutes of tight games.\n\nThink we're done yet? Think again. Assists matter too!\n\nLeBron and Rajon Rondo were in a league of their own when it came to passing the ball during the closing stretch of a tight game. They were both willing and able to find openings in the suffocating defenses thrown at them, and the rest of the league just wasn't even close.\n\nNow, how many of the 15 names are repeats? The answer is rather simple: only one.\n\nLeBron appears on all three graphs, and no other player in the NBA finds himself on more than a single top-five leaderboard. He's an elite scorer, rebounder and distributor when the pressure cooker is turned up to its highest notch.\n\nLiterally, no one else can say that. And did this change in the postseason? Of course not!\n\nOnce the playoffs rolled around, the Heat star finished No. 1 in clutch scoring, No. 4 in rebounding (behind Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw), and No. 7 in assists (trailing Kirk Hinrich, Russell Westbrook, Josh Smith, Manu Ginobili, Mike Conley and Luol Deng).\n\nStill pretty darn elite.\n\nPIE vs. Winning Percentage\n\nPlayer impact estimate (PIE) hasn't entered the collective consciousness of NBA fans yet, but it's a wonderful tool used by NBA.com to show how involved a player is. Instead of usage rate, which omits assists, rebounds and anything that doesn't finish a play, PIE \"measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in.\"\n\nDuring clutch situations, no player had a higher PIE than LeBron's 29.7. He was just ultra-involved in the contest at all times, more so than Kobe Bryant (26.5), Kevin Durant (24.3), James Harden (23.3) and everyone else.\n\nBut, that's only good if it results in success. Being highly involved can be a bad thing if wins aren't the result.\n\nFor that reason, I've put together this graph, which correlates PIE (X-axis) with winning percentage (Y-axis) for the 20 most \"involved\" players in the NBA:\n\nThat's a pretty telling image, as LeBron both had the highest winning percentage and the most involvement. He's the dot in the top right, and he's joined at 80 percent on the Y-axis by his teammate, Chris Bosh.\n\nNo one else is close in either category. But now, let's break it down even further and look at his involvement in the Heat's scoring plays.\n\nInvolvement in Scoring Plays\n\nTwo new stats are relevant here: percent assisted and percent field goals made.\n\nThe former represents the number of made shots by teammates that were assisted by the player in question when he was on the court, and the latter shows the percentage of made field goals credited to the player when he was playing.\n\nAt this point, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that LeBron James was elite in both categories during crunch time among those who played at least 20 games that met the parameters.\n\nIn fact, he finished fifth in percent assisted, behind only Ricky Rubio, Rajon Rondo, Will Bynum and Raymond Felton. As for percent field goals made, he was significantly lower, but still doing pretty well for himself with at 15th.\n\nBut let's take this a step beyond and combine the two to show overall involvement in scoring plays, something that I'm just going to call percent scoring. It's calculated rather easily, just by adding percent assisted to percent field goals made.\n\nAs you might expect, LeBron is right near the top of the leaderboard:\n\nLeBron and Kobe should stand out to you. The rest are all point guards—yes, that's Will Bynum benefiting from a small sample size, not Andrew Bynum—which makes sense, because floor generals are naturally more involved in the playmaking.\n\nThere's also a major benefit gained from being a superstar on a lackluster team. That's giving Kyrie Irving and Jrue Holiday an artificial boost, as there simply weren't other intriguing options on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.\n\nFor those reasons, you should be most impressed by LeBron, Kobe and CP3, considering their teammates.\n\nAnd across the board, you should just be in awe of how great LeBron is with the game on the line. Although there's already a large gap between him and the rest of the league no matter how much time is left on the clock, there's an even larger disparity when nearing the final buzzer in a tight game.\n\nHis scoring prowess, willingness to make the right play, and consistent ability to come out on top make him stand out in a big way.\n\nGo ahead—keep denying LeBron's ability to come up big when it counts. The rest of us will be over here trying to contain our laughter.\n\nNote: All stats, unless otherwise indicated, come from NBA.com's statistical databases, and all graphics were created with Infogr.am.\n\n"

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

Today, we’re settling in with the stats to see what the numbers reveal about these two legends.\n\nDataset Overview\n\nData Source\n\n1. LeBron’s Career Dataset (lebron_career.csv)\n\nThis dataset contains detailed information about LeBron James’ career in the NBA, including game statistics and outcomes. The dataset consists of 1,265 rows and 26 columns. Key columns include:\n\n2. LeBron’s Playoffs Dataset (lebron_playoffs.csv)\n\nThis dataset provides detailed statistics for LeBron James’ playoff games. It includes 260 rows and 27 columns, with similar attributes to the career dataset, along with additional playoff-specific columns:\n\n3. Jordan’s Career Dataset (jordan_career.csv)\n\nThis dataset contains detailed statistics of Michael Jordan’s NBA career, similar to LeBron’s career dataset. It consists of 1,072 rows and 26 columns, with key columns including:\n\n4. Jordan’s Playoffs Dataset (jordan_playoffs.csv)\n\nThis dataset provides detailed statistics for Michael Jordan’s playoff games, including 179 rows and 27 columns. It includes similar columns to the career dataset with additional playoff-specific information:\n\nEach dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the players’ performances, including basic game metrics (minutes played, field goals, points, etc.) and advanced metrics (game score, plus/minus). These datasets will be used to compare LeBron James and Michael Jordan’s performances across their careers and playoff appearances.\n\nCareer Longevity and Total Impact\n\nLeBron James stands out in career totals:\n\nJordan’s career totals:\n\nLeBron’s higher totals showcase his exceptional longevity and consistent impact across multiple teams and eras of the NBA. His ability to maintain elite performance over a more extended period is truly remarkable.\n\nPer-Game Brilliance\n\nJordan takes the lead in per-game averages:\n\nLeBron edges out in:\n\nJordan’s higher scoring average and steal rate suggest a more intense, game-changing presence on both ends of the court during his prime years. LeBron’s numbers reflect a more versatile skill set, focused on overall team impact and facilitating play.\n\nScoring Machines: A Closer Look\n\nThe distribution of points scored per game reveals fascinating insights:\n\nThis data suggests that while LeBron is an incredibly consistent scorer, Jordan had a higher capacity for explosive scoring nights, cementing his reputation as one of the most potent offensive forces in NBA history.\n\nWinning Ways\n\nThe win percentage trends tell a compelling story:\n\nJordan’s peak aligns with a dominant team era, while LeBron’s adaptability across different teams is evident in his late-career success.\n\nPeak Performance and Playoff Prowess\n\nTheir playoff win percentages are remarkably close:\n\nThese numbers indicate that both players were at their most dominant in their late 20s, with LeBron maintaining his peak slightly longer. Their nearly identical playoff win percentages speak to their comparable levels of postseason success and clutch performance.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn conclusion, the numbers paint a picture of two distinct but equally impactful styles of greatness. Jordan’s career is characterized by unmatched scoring prowess and a period of absolute dominance, while LeBron’s showcases incredible longevity, versatility, and the ability to transform multiple franchises into contenders.\n\nIn the end, this data doesn’t definitively settle the GOAT debate — but it does deepen our appreciation for the unique strengths each player brought to the game. It’s a reminder that greatness in basketball can take different forms, and that we’re fortunate to have witnessed two of the game’s most extraordinary talents.\n\nWhat’s your take on these stats?

Early Life and Career Beginnings: Michael Jordan\nMichael Jordan’s childhood begins in the town of Wilmington, North Carolina where he moved at a young age after being birthed in Brooklyn, New York. He was a stellar multi-sport athlete in the sports baseball, football, and basketball but that wasn’t enough for his hometown high school of Emsley A. Laney High School. He was cut from the school varsity team in his sophomore year but soon made it back as their star athlete. After high school he played in the NCAA where he led his team to a D1 championship in only his freshman year. The following years as both a sophomore & junior he was named the NCAA college player of the year which added to his early collection of accolades. The only reason his stellar college run was cut short was because he left to join the NBA. Jordan, part of the ‘84 draft class, was drafted 3rd overall  by the Chicago Bulls.\nJordan’s school picture day at his Elementary School\n\nII. Early Life and Career Beginnings: LeBron James\nLebron James’s childhood was difficult to say the least. He was born to an ex-con for a father and to his mom, Gloria, when she was only 16 years old. Early in his life, he moved 6+ times, missing over a 100 days of school which showed that his parent(s) never paid attention to his education, shedding a spotlight on how he was led to sports. His first sport played was Football, which Lebron saw as his favorite sport when he was young. Finally warming up to his life, he was forced to move again. He led his hometown Akron basketball team to three state titles and was named “Mr. Basketball” in Ohio for three straight years. He decided not to go to college and went straight to the NBA where he was the number 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers, his path to success got off to a rocky but strong start.\n-Sports Illustrated\n\nIII. Career Achievements\nEarly on Jordan demonstrated his prowess by averaging 28.2 points a game winning rookie of the year (ROTY). He won his first championship in 1991 and went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to two three-peats in the 1990s. He then “having no more to prove” retired in October 1993 to go play for a minor league baseball team. One season later he returned to the Bulls late in the 1994-95 season to lead them to another 3 championships in the years ’96-98. He retired for a second time in January 1999. He went on to buy a share of the Washington Wizards and also became the president of basketball operations on the team. He returned to basketball again to join the Wizards and became the first player aged 40+ to score more than 40 PPG. Jordan’s final retirement from basketball appeared in May 2003.Overall, Jordan made 6 finals appearances with a total of 6 finals wins.\nTotals: Six-time NBA champion (1991-93, 1996-98); MVP (1988, ’91, ’92, ’96, ’98); 10-time All-NBA First Team (1987-93, 1996-98); All-NBA Second Team (1985); Defensive Player of the Year (1988); Nine-time All-Defensive First Team (1988-93, 1996-98); Rookie of the Year (1985); 14-time All-Star; All-Star MVP (1988, ’96, ’98); One of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (’96); Olympic gold medalist (1984, ’92).\nLebron’s first championship came in 2012 with the Miami Heat with 27.1 PPG, followed by two more with the Heat in 2013 and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, solidifying his status as one of the greatest players of all time. Additionally, his four MVP awards showcase his consistent excellence and impact on the game throughout his career. Lebron had a total of 10 Finals appearances, which he won 4 out of showcasing his capability to fight to the top even without as much support as other teams have had.\nLeBron James has been selected to the All-Star game a total of 17 times, further highlighting his dominance and impact on the league. He has also won one scoring title in 2008, displaying his versatility and ability to excel in different aspects of the game. In comparison, Jordan has been selected to the All-Star game 14 times and has won 10 scoring titles, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – Jordan\n\nOff the court, Michael Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and his global brand cannot be understated. His influence transcends the sport, as seen through his successful Jordan Brand which continues to be a powerhouse in the world of sneakers and apparel. Jordan’s legacy extends far beyond his playing days, solidifying his status as a true icon in both sports and popular culture. The Jordan brand’s roots actually come from his parents. Not only did Jordan not begin with Nike, he actually started the deal with Converse & Adidas. Adidas was known as Jordan’s personal favorite, but when Nike offered him 250,000 – more than double Adidas offered – and a signature shoe, his parents urged him to take the deal. There are now 39 main flagship models with thousands of styles. Jordan serves as an inspiration no matter where he is to both NBA players and children alike. His skills and increasing influence led fans not only in the USA, but also across the entire world to hear of his prowess and in turn boost television viewership. Finally, by becoming a stake in the Charlotte Hornets, this showcased his commitment to not only playing but also coaching the new generation of basketball.\n\nA public school founded by LeBron James in Akron, Ohio.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – LeBron\nConversely, Lebron has had tremendous impact, exemplified by his nickname King James, or the Chosen One. His records are seemingly unbreakable with over 40 thousand points in the regular season, additionally, James has scored 40+ points against all 30 teams.  His philanthropy has taken roots in higher education, mentoring, advocacy, after-school programs, and early childhood development or learning. The LeBron James Family Foundation has raised over 100 Million for these causes. Finally, LeBron, after struggling with poverty as a child, works towards better education for those children now. As LeBron James has not retired yet, his influence is only yet to grow and the rest is history.\n\nV. Conclusion\nOverall, Lebron and Jordan have both made significant contributions to society through their philanthropic efforts and social activism. While Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and global brand is undeniable, LeBron has also used his platform to create positive change in the world. Both players have left a lasting legacy that extends beyond the basketball court, solidifying their status as true icons in sports and popular culture. Finally, it all comes down to personal preference and interpretation of the facts.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level. It quite literally does not get better than that.\nNBA POSITIONAL RANKINGS: PG | SG | SF | PF | C\nLeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Regular season stats\nJames' longevity gives him the edge in total statistics but Jordan holds the edge in scoring average.

At the forefront of this conversation are two iconic figures: LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan. Each has left an indelible mark on the NBA, redefining the standards of greatness in their own eras. As we delve into the intricate details of their careers, statistics, and impact on the game, we aim to answer the burning question: Who is the real G.O.A.T?\nCareer Averages and Scoring Records\nOne of the primary metrics in the G.O.A.T debate is scoring prowess. Michael Jordan, renowned for his scoring ability, boasts a career average of 30.1 points per game, a mark that LeBron James, with his 27.2 points per game, has yet to surpass. However, the debate takes an intriguing turn when considering the overall impact on the team. LeBron’s additional assists per game have contributed to more points for his teams, making the scoring comparison more nuanced.\nCareer Points and Longevity\nLeBron James recently etched his name in the history books by becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, surpassing the legendary Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. This achievement adds a layer of complexity to the debate. While Jordan reached significant scoring milestones earlier in his career, LeBron’s longevity and consistent performance indicate that he might extend the gap in total career points. The question now arises: Will LeBron’s record be out of reach, and could he potentially breach the 40,000 or even 45,000 career points mark?\nGames Played and Load Management\nThe dynamics of the NBA have evolved over the years, introducing the concept of “load management.” Michael Jordan’s era saw him play all 82 regular-season games in nine out of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons during the Bulls’ last three championship runs. In contrast, LeBron James, adapting to the modern approach, has played all 82 games only once in his 20-year career. The debate over load management and its impact on each player’s career adds an extra layer to the G.O.A.T conversation.\nEfficiency and Shooting Prowess\nEfficiency on the court is a critical aspect of any player’s legacy. Examining points per shot attempt, LeBron James has consistently maintained a high level of efficiency throughout his career. Even when facing top defenders, he has managed to stay above the league average. In contrast, Michael Jordan experienced fluctuations in efficiency, falling below the league average multiple times. LeBron’s ability to score efficiently, even against strong defenses, provides a compelling argument in the G.O.A.T debate.\nAdvanced Metrics\nThe advent of advanced metrics has brought a new dimension to the G.O.A.T conversation. Metrics such as Value Over Replacement (VORP) and Win Shares attempt to balance differences in eras and showcase a player’s overall value. LeBron James leads the G.O.A.T race in VORP, outpacing not only Michael Jordan but also every other player in NBA history by a significant margin. These advanced metrics shed light on the impact each player had beyond traditional statistics.\nPlayoffs Performance\nThe true measure of greatness often lies in a player’s ability to shine on the grandest stage—the NBA Playoffs. Michael Jordan’s playoff performances are etched in basketball lore, highlighted by his remarkable scoring average of 33.4 points per game. LeBron James, while trailing in scoring, has consistently demonstrated his prowess in rebounds and assists during the postseason. The misconception that LeBron “shrinks” in big games is dispelled by his impressive playoff performances, often surpassing his regular-season feats.\nPlayoffs Totals and Advanced Stats\nDelving deeper into playoff totals and advanced stats provides a more comprehensive understanding of each player’s impact in the postseason. LeBron James, having played more playoff games, has surpassed Jordan in total points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and minutes. Advanced playoff metrics, including Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Box Plus/Minus, reveal a close competition, with Jordan leading in some categories and LeBron in others. These stats further fuel the G.O.A.T debate, making it a nuanced discussion beyond simple championship counts.\nAccolades and Awards\nThe hardware collected throughout a player’s career often serves as a tangible representation of their impact on the game. Michael Jordan’s six NBA championships, all secured without the need for a Game 7, stand as a testament to his dominance in the 1990s. LeBron James, with four NBA championships and a more diverse journey across multiple teams, has controlled the Eastern Conference for nearly a decade. The comparison of MVP awards, Finals MVPs, All-NBA selections, and other accolades adds another layer to the G.O.A.T debate.\nLegacy Beyond Basketball\nThe impact of Michael Jordan and LeBron James extends far beyond the basketball court. Jordan’s influence on popular culture, evident in the global phenomenon of the Air Jordan brand, transcends the sport. LeBron, known for his philanthropy and activism, has utilized his platform to address social issues and inspire change. The comparison of their off-court legacies raises questions about the criteria for evaluating greatness and whether it should be confined to on-court achievements.\nThe Unfinished Business\nAs LeBron James continues to add to his illustrious career, the question of unfinished business looms large. At 38, LeBron is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired. With the potential for more championships, the pursuit of 40,000 career points, and the possibility of playing alongside his son in the NBA, LeBron’s narrative is far from concluded. These potential future achievements could reshape the G.O.A.T conversation and introduce new elements to consider.\nConclusion\nThe debate over whether LeBron James or Michael Jordan deserves the title of the greatest basketball player of all time is a complex and multifaceted discussion. Each player brings a unique set of skills, achievements, and impact on and off the court. From scoring records to advanced metrics, from playoff performances to accolades, the comparison reveals a closely contested battle with no clear-cut winner.\nkhizer.hussain\nMeet Khizer Hussain, our standout sports analyst, here to guide you beyond the numbers on the scoreboard.

LeBron James is clearly still the best player in the world, and the only thing he has yet to prove is to exceed the Michael Jordan comparison. While LeBron James is a completely different player to MJ and plays a different position, the debate will always be there as Jordan is considered the greatest player of all time and the standard for all great players.\nOne topic of comparison is always the competition both legends faced and the road they took to winning NBA championships. Jordan has 6 rings compared to LeBron's 4, but LeBron might have had the tougher competition when narrowing down each Finals' appearance. However, Jordan might have faced the best all-around players in his 6 Finals appearances whereas LeBron played better teams. Nonetheless, it is time to capture each player's NBA Finals appearances by assessing the competition.\nMichael Jordan\n\n1991 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Magic Johnson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Vlade Divac (Hall of Famer), James Worthy (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team)\nMJ's first NBA Finals appearance was a positive one, as was the case for all of MJ's NBA rings. Jordan and the Bulls led the charge against legendary point guard Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. In a showdown between the 2 best players in the era, this was an amazing series whereby Jordan stamped his mark on the league. MJ and the Bulls fell in Game 1, before closing out the series in 5. MJ was the key player all series long, with Scottie Pippen adding in a sensational 32-point game in Game 5 to help MJ close it out. The Lakers finished 3rd in the league that season compared to the Bulls finishing first, and the Jordan era officially began in the 1991 Finals.\n1992 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Clyde Drexler (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Buck Williams (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis is known as the series where Michael Jordan took things personally. Clyde Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1st seed in the Western Conference against the 1st seeded Chicago Bulls. Drexler was thought to be at least equal competition to Michael Jordan, which MJ wanted to prove wrong. Drexler held his own with sensational performances in the series, but MJ had too many key moments such as hitting 6 threes in the 1st quarter of Game 1 and then dropping 33 points in a closeout Game 6. Jordan would simply not allow the series to go to 7, as he was ruthless in making it clear Drexler doesn't come close to his greatness.\n1993 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Charles Barkley (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Dan Majerle (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis was probably the toughest opponent for Michael Jordan. Led by league MVP Charles Barkley, the Suns had the best record in the West while Chicago fell to the #2 seed. As great as Barkley and defensive specialist Dan Majerle were, Jordan and the Bulls were just better. The Bulls took the first 2 games of the series before Phoenix won in 3-OT in Game 3. Jordan responded with 55 points in Game 4 before he made the iconic pass to John Paxson for the game-winning three. Barkley was a dominant player in the series but Jordan was near perfection all series long and he once again did not allow for a Game 7.\n1996 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Gary Payton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Shawn Kemp (All-NBA 2nd Team)\nAfter a brief retirement, Michael Jordan returned to the NBA to continue the MJ-era. Jordan wasn't going away anytime soon, and he led the charge against defensive phenom Gary Payton and athletic glass cleaner Shawn Kemp. MJ and the Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season, as they went to battle with the number one seed in the West. The Bulls were up 3-0 in the series before Payton and Kemp fought back to win 2 straight. Jordan struggled from the floor in Game 6 shooting 5-19, but he had enough help from Pippen and Rodman to close out the series and win Finals MVP in yet another Game 6 closeout.\n1997 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team, All-NBA 2nd Defensive Team)\nMJ and the Bulls made their 5th straight NBA Finals appearance against Karl Malone and John Stockton, who led the Jazz to the best record in the Western Conference. The Bulls won the first 2 games before Utah evened it up in 4. In the legendary \"Flu Game\", Jordan dropped 38 points and willed Chicago to victory in one of the most iconic moments. Jordan then had another iconic moment when he found Steve Kerr for the game-winning shot to capture his 5th title and 5th Finals MVP. Stockton and Malone were a great duo and this presented a massive challenge to MJ and the Bulls, so Jordan's unselfishness in Game 6 was one of his greatest moments.\n1998 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer)\nWas there ever any doubt that Jordan would reach the Finals again? He already had one 3-peat with the Bulls and wanted to do it again. The #1 seeded Bulls led the charge against the #1 seeded Utah Jazz led by Hall of Fame duo Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone and Stockton had taken Game 1 before Chicago answered with 3 straight victories. After Utah stole Game 5, Jordan had one of the most iconic moments in history by stripping Karl Malone on one end and hit the game-winning shot over Bryon Russell to capture his 6th NBA title and 6th Finals MVP.\nLeBron James\n\n2007 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Bruce Bowen (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron's first Finals appearance did not go as he planned, mainly because he was outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Spurs were simply a better team than the Cavaliers as they had 3 Hall of Famers playing under a Hall of Fame coach. Bruce Bowen also made an All-NBA Defensive Team which made life particularly difficult for LeBron in this series. This was a tough series for LeBron as the Cavs were swept, and LeBron does get a pass for most people on this one.\n2011 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Dirk Nowitzki (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Jason Kidd (Hall of Famer), Tyson Chandler (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron's 2nd Finals' appearance also did not go as planned. He had a Superteam with the Miami Heat with the likes of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh by his side, and they were the heavy favorites coming into the series. In possibly the most shocking way, LeBron played much below his usual level and the Heat were beaten in 6 games by the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki was the best player during the playoffs and LeBron James was nowhere near as great. This is a big black mark on LeBron's legendary career for sure.\n2012 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Russell Westbrook (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), James Harden (Hall of Famer), Serge Ibaka (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron James made amends for his prior Finals appearance disaster by leading the Heat Superteam against the Oklahoma City Thunder who had their own younger Superteam. Led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder had athleticism and youth on their side along with an exceptional 6th man in James Harden and an All-NBA Defensive Team player in Serge Ibaka. The Heat were simply too good with their Big Three, and LeBron James finally played like the best player in the series to win his first NBA title.\n2013 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer)\nLeBron's 2nd NBA title came against the San Antonio Spurs, who should have beaten LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Known as the series where Ray Allen made the most clutch shot in NBA history, the Heat fought back and won the series despite being down 3-2. LeBron James was once again the best player in the series, and he willed his team to victory in this series against 4 Hall of Fame Spurs players. Head coach Gregg Popovich forced LeBron to beat them with jumpers, and he did that on his way to winning his 2nd straight Finals MVP.\n2014 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer, All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron James once again was in the Finals with the Miami Heat for the 4th time in a row, this time falling short to the Spurs who exacted their revenge. The Spurs were on a mission this season and the growth of Kawhi Leonard into a star helped San Antonio blow out the Heat in the series. Leonard won Finals MVP, and LeBron could not do enough to counter the Spurs' new Big Four. Dwyane Wade looked older in this series and LeBron James had to settle for another Finals loss in his record.\n2015 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Andrew Bogut (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nOnce again, LeBron James made the Finals this time with his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers. With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love by his side, LeBron James made the Cavs the favorite in the Eastern Conference. Making it all the way to the Finals, they are up against Stephen Curry and the revolutionary Warriors team who introduced the small-ball lineup with Andre Iguodala playing the power forward spot. Unfortunately for LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injures leaving him to fend off the Big Three Warriors by himself. He had a sensational series, but the Warriors had too much with Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP over LeBron James and sending him home with a loss.\n2016 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nThe greatest achievement in LeBron's career came in the 2016 NBA Finals, whereby he played the Warriors against this time with a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Cavs were down 3-1 in the series, and it looked like LeBron would have to suffer yet another loss in the Finals. But he took his game to another level, and alongside Kyrie Irving, were too dominant for the Warriors as they won the NBA title in a historic comeback. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the series, although Kyrie Irving hit the biggest shot of the game in Game 7 to win the series.\n2017 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs once again made the NBA Finals to play the Warriors, except Golden State added superstar player Kevin Durant to join their Big Three of Curry, Thompson, and Green. LeBron still had Irving and Love, but the Warriors were just unstoppable with Kevin Durant as they beat down the Cavs convincingly. LeBron held his own and would have been Finals MVP in the victory, but Durant and the Warriors were too dominant on both ends as KD won Finals MVP and added the 5th Finals loss to LeBron's record.\n2018 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs made the NBA Finals yet again, this time without Kyrie Irving who was traded to Boston. It is a shame LeBron did not have his little brother Irving by his side because their duo was truly exciting to watch. Without Irving, LeBron had to lead average players to battle against the Golden State Warriors juggernaut led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. In one of the most embarrassing Finals moments in history, J.R. Smith dribbled out the clock instead of helping the Cavs snatch Game 1. LeBron put forth a Goliath 50-point performance that went to waste, effectively ending the series the Cavs lost 4-0.\n2020 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Jimmy Butler (All-NBA 3rd Team), Bam Adebayo (All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nWith LeBron's 3rd NBA team, he won his 4th NBA title. While certainly not the toughest opponent that LeBron faced and the easiest challenge in both MJ's and LeBron's competition, James and the Lakers beat the Heat in 6 games. LeBron James had Anthony Davis by his side, while Jimmy Butler was left to fend for himself as both Bam Adebayo and starting point guard Goran Dragic were out with injuries. Butler held his own with iconic performances, but LeBron and Davis were the best duo in the NBA and the Lakers were too good for any team in the league. While LeBron's easiest challenge, the Heat were no pushovers as LeBron James had to play at an MVP level to win his 4th Finals MVP.\nNext\nRanking The 10 Greatest Teammates That Michael Jordan Has Ever Had In His Career\n2020 NBA Free Agency: Ranking Top 15 Best Players Who Could Be Available\nRanking The 10 Greatest NBA Players Of The 90s\nRanking LeBron James’ 10 Best Teams In The NBA Finals\nLos Angeles Lakers Have 6 Of Top 10 Greatest Players Of All-Time\n\nBy\nEddie Bitar\nEddie Bitar is a senior staff writer at Fadeaway World, renowned for his insightful blend of sports journalism with economic and financial expertise.

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

          "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs. LeBron: Who Faced Tougher Competition in the NBA Finals?\n\nBy Jason McIntyre | Jun 26, 2013\n\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James.\n\nMichael Jordan finished his brilliant NBA career with six championships. LeBron James â only 28 â has won two titles. Nate Silver of the Times had a great breakdown of where they both were at 28, and what LeBronâs chances are of catching Jordanâs six rings. (Spoiler: 30 percent). Also, hereâs a graphic that was making the rounds on the internet over the weekend that you may be interested in:\n\nUndeniable: LeBron has accomplished more at this stage in his NBA career than Jordan has. [Counter: But Jordan went to college!]\n\nI wanted to take a slightly different angle. The 80âs belonged to Magic and Larry. Magicâs last game in his prime was in 1991 (letâs not count that brief run in 1996), and Birdâs was in 1992 at the age of 35. Then, Michael Jordan took over. Many a basketball argument has boiled down to, âhey, Jordan was beating up on a watered-down league compared to the 80s â there were far fewer legendary stars.â [Counter: Huh? The 80s were all Lakers/Celtics with a smattering of Dr. J, Moses and the Pistons.]\n\nI thought itâd be interesting to look back at the teams Jordan beat in his six trips to the Finals against the four teams LeBron has faced in the Finals so far.\n\n1991: Bulls 4, LA Lakers 1 â Lakers won Game 1, Bulls owned rest of the series. Scott & Worthy were hurt and missed Game 5. Scott took just 18 shots in the series.\n1992: Bulls 4, Portland 2 â Probably the weakest team the Bulls beat in Jordanâs six trips to the Finals. Won 57 games. Drexler in his prime.\n1993: Bulls 4, Phoenix 2 â Iâd listen to an argument that all of LeBronâs Finals opponents were better than this Suns team. Won 62 games. Barkley was the NBA MVP.\n\n1996: Bulls 4, Seattle 2 â A good Sonics team, and Kemp had a beastly series, but heâs not Dirk, thatâs for sure. Won 64 games.\n1997: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Might be the best team Jordan beat in the Finals. Karl Malone was the League MVP. Won 64 games.\n1998: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Virtually the exact same core as the year prior. Won 62 games.\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the teams Jordan beat in the Finals: 1) 91 Lakers, 2) 97 Jazz, 3) 98 Jazz, 4) 93 Suns, 5) 96 Sonics, 6) 92 Blazers.\n\nLeBronâs Final opponents? This is probably due to recency bias, but Iâd say theyâve been considerably tougher than the teams Jordan beat:\n\n2007: Spurs 4, Cavaliers 0 â The Spurs went 16-4 in the playoffs. Tim Duncan is a Top 10 player in NBA history and better than any of the players Jordan beat, with the exception of Magic. [Counter: 1991 Magic led the NBA in turnovers, his shooting from the field was in steady decline, he was only 2nd in the NBA in assists, and the Lakers were at the end of their dynasty, finishing 2nd in the West.] Tony Parker was the MVP of this series, and just for fun â¦ in the annals of NBA history, who will wind up thought of as the better player, Tony Parker or Gary Payton? Tony Parker or John Stockton?\n\n2011: Mavericks 4, Heat 2 â Dirk Nowitzki is considered one of the best shooting forwards in NBA history. Barkley or Dirk? Barkley was 29 on his only trip to the Finals, and averaged 27 points and 13 rebounds in that series. He had 32-12-10 in a Game 4 loss, and 42-13 in a Game 2 loss. Dirk or Kemp? Dirk or Mailman? Dirk averaged 26-9 in the 2011 Finals, and made 45 of 46 free throws. Fun discussion where thereâs no right or wrong answer: Was Dirk a more complete player than Barkley, Kemp and Mailman? The Mavs beat Kobe, Durant and LeBron in the postseason.\n\n2012: Heat 4, Thunder 1 â Difficult to say how good this Thunder team was. We may not know for a few years. But at this rate, Durant and Westbrook (assuming they stick together) could end up having Hall of Fame careers and being similar to Stockton/Malone, who went to the Finals twice. Jordan never faced a dominant young scoring tandem such as Durant and Westbrook in the Finals.\n\n2013: Heat 4, Spurs 3: Duncan at 37, Ginobili at 35. And San Antonio benefited from the Westbrook injury (and swept the Lakers minus Kobe). The West was such a mess, the Spurs struggled against the Warriors (4-2), then swept the Grizzlies, who were only there because of the Westbrook injury. Iâd compare these Spurs tot he 1991 Lakers, but that Laker team was injured and not nearly as old. Comparing across decades is impossible and an exercise in futility, but wouldnât this yearâs Spurs team have beaten any of Jordanâs Finals opponents?\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the 10 opponents Jordan and LeBron have faced in the Finals:\n\n1. 2007 Spurs (LeBron)\n2. 1991 Lakers (Jordan)\n3. 2011 Mavericks (LeBron)\n4. 1997 Jazz (Jordan)\n5. 1998 Jazz (Jordan)\n6. 2013 Spurs (LeBron)\n7. 2012 Thunder (LeBron)\n8. 1993 Suns (Jordan)\n9. 1996 Sonics (Jordan)\n10. 1992 Blazers (Jordan)\n\nÂ© 2025 TheBigLead - All Rights Reserved\n\n"

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\n\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\n\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\n\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\n\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something.\n\nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\n\nThe overall picture\n\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\n\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\n\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\n\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\n\nNot so fast...\n\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\n\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\n\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\n\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\n\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\n\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\n\n\n\nIt's not just the first round either.\n\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\n\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\n\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat.\n\nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\n\nTeam | Round | Rating | Who? | Result\n1986 Celtics | 1st Round | 1770 | MJ | Lost\n1989 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1767 | MJ | Lost\n2008 Celtics | Conf Semis | 1700 | LeBron | Lost\n2011 Bulls | Conf Finals | 1698 | LeBron | Won\n1985 Bucks | 1st Round | 1697 | MJ | Lost\n1993 Knicks | Conf Finals | 1696 | MJ | Won\n1990 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1686 | MJ | Lost\n1998 Pacers | Conf Finals | 1680 | MJ | Won\n2009 Magic | Conf Finals | 1680 | LeBron | Lost\n1987 Celtics | 1st Round | 1676 | MJ | Lost\n1996 Magic | Conf Finals | 1671 | MJ | Won\nDid LeBron have it easier prior to reaching the Finals? Yes.\n\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\n\nFinals opponents\n\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\n\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\n\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year.\n\nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition.\n\nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\n\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\n\nTeam | Rating | Opponent\n2017 Warriors | 1850 | LeBron\n2015 Warriors | 1802 | LeBron\n2016 Warriors | 1790 | LeBron\n1998 Jazz | 1762 | MJ\n1997 Jazz | 1751 | MJ\n2012 Thunder | 1737 | LeBron\n2014 Spurs | 1730 | LeBron\n2011 Mavericks | 1717 | LeBron\n2013 Spurs | 1711 | LeBron\n2018 Warriors | 1710 | LeBron\n2007 Spurs | 1705 | LeBron\n1992 Blazers | 1702 | MJ\n1991 Lakers | 1697 | MJ\n1996 Sonics | 1695 | MJ\n1993 Suns | 1634 | MJ\nIt's a team sport!\n\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\n\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\n\nIt's impossible to know.\n\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings.\n\n | Jordan | LeBron\nTeam rating | 1770 | 1687\nOpponent | 1706 | 1750\nDifference | +64 | -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\n\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\n\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\n\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\n\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\n\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\n\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\n\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\n\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nMicah Adams\n\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.

          "raw_content": "Navigation\n\nPopular Categories\n\nExamining the Impact of LeBron James on the Lakers Dynasty\n\nAs a lifelong basketball fan and someone who's been writing about the sport for over two decades, I've seen many players come and go. But few have had the impact that LeBron James has had, especially on the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron's arrival in LA in 2018 marked a significant shift in the team's trajectory, and his presence has undeniably shaped the modern era of the Lakers dynasty. In this post, we'll delve into the multifaceted impact of LeBron James on the Lakers, exploring his influence on the court, in the locker room, and within the broader context of the NBA.\n\nGrowing up in the Bay Area, I was always more of a Warriors fan, but the allure of the Lakers—with their star-studded rosters and Hollywood glamour—was impossible to ignore. When LeBron joined the Lakers, it felt like a seismic shift in the NBA landscape. His move to LA wasn't just about basketball; it was about legacy, branding, and the future of the sport.\n\nSo, what exactly has LeBron brought to the Lakers? Let's break it down.\n\nOn-Court Impact: The King's Reign\n\nStatistical Dominance\n\nFirst and foremost, LeBron's on-court impact is undeniable. Since joining the Lakers, he's continued to put up staggering numbers, even as he's aged. His ability to score, facilitate, and defend at an elite level has been a game-changer for the Lakers. In his first season with the team, he averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game—numbers that are simply jaw-dropping for a player in his 16th season.\n\nBut it's not just about the stats. LeBron's presence on the court changes the dynamics of the game. His basketball IQ, court vision, and leadership have elevated the play of those around him. Players like Anthony Davis have thrived under his guidance, and the Lakers have seen a resurgence in their offensive and defensive capabilities.\n\nChampionship Run\n\nOf course, the ultimate measure of success in the NBA is championships, and LeBron delivered in 2020. The Lakers' championship run that year was a testament to LeBron's leadership and the team's cohesion. His performance in the playoffs, particularly in the Finals against the Miami Heat, was nothing short of spectacular. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game in the Finals, securing his fourth championship and fourth Finals MVP award.\n\nThat championship was more than just a trophy; it was a statement. It proved that LeBron could still lead a team to the promised land, even in the latter stages of his career. It also reaffirmed the Lakers' status as a premier franchise, capable of attracting top talent and competing at the highest level.\n\nInjuries and Adaptability\n\nHowever, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. LeBron has dealt with his fair share of injuries since joining the Lakers, which has forced the team to adapt. His absence has highlighted the importance of depth and the need for other players to step up. In some ways, these challenges have made the Lakers a more resilient and versatile team.\n\nBut let's be real, the Lakers are a different beast with LeBron on the court. His ability to adapt his game, whether it's playing more in the post or focusing on facilitating, has been crucial. He's a chameleon on the court, always finding ways to contribute, even as his role evolves.\n\nOff-Court Impact: The LeBron Effect\n\nLeadership and Mentorship\n\nLeBron's impact extends far beyond the court. His leadership and mentorship have been instrumental in shaping the Lakers' culture. He's known for his work ethic, professionalism, and dedication to the game. These qualities have rubbed off on his teammates, creating a culture of excellence and accountability.\n\nPlayers like Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball have spoken about the influence LeBron has had on their careers. His guidance has helped them grow as players and professionals. This kind of leadership is invaluable, especially in a league where young players are constantly coming in and needing direction.\n\nBrand and Business\n\nLeBron's arrival in LA also brought a significant boost to the Lakers' brand and business. His star power and global appeal have attracted new fans, sponsors, and media attention. The Lakers have always been a marquee franchise, but with LeBron, they've reached new heights of popularity and relevance.\n\nHis business acumen has also been a boon for the Lakers. LeBron's involvement in various business ventures, from media production to investments, has positioned him as more than just an athlete. He's a brand, an influencer, and a businessman. This multifaceted approach has benefited the Lakers, both on and off the court.\n\nCommunity and Social Impact\n\nBeyond the game, LeBron's impact on the community and his social activism have been profound. His I PROMISE School in Akron, Ohio, is a testament to his commitment to education and community development. In LA, he's continued this work, using his platform to address social issues and inspire change.\n\nHis vocal stance on social justice has resonated with fans and players alike. He's used his voice to advocate for equality, fairness, and progress. This kind of leadership transcends basketball and speaks to the broader impact athletes can have on society.\n\nThe Future of the Lakers Dynasty\n\nSustaining Success\n\nLooking ahead, the big question is: Can the Lakers sustain their success with LeBron at the helm? As he ages, the challenges will only grow. Injuries, fatigue, and the natural decline of athletic abilities are all factors to consider.\n\nBut if there's one thing we've learned about LeBron, it's that he's always up for a challenge. His dedication to his craft, his body, and his mindset has allowed him to defy the odds time and time again. As long as he's in purple and gold, the Lakers will be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBuilding Around LeBron\n\nThe key to sustaining success will be building a strong supporting cast around LeBron. The Lakers have done a decent job of this so far, but there's always room for improvement. Bringing in the right mix of veterans and young talent will be crucial. Players who can complement LeBron's strengths and fill in the gaps when he's not on the court.\n\nThe front office will also play a significant role. Smart drafting, strategic trades, and savvy free agency moves will be essential. The Lakers have a rich history of attracting top talent, and they'll need to continue that tradition to stay competitive.\n\nThe Next Generation\n\nEventually, the torch will need to be passed to the next generation. LeBron can't play forever, and the Lakers will need to prepare for life after The King. This means investing in young talent, developing them, and giving them the tools to succeed.\n\nPlayers like Talen Horton-Tucker and Austin Reaves have shown promise, and the Lakers will need more of that. Building a sustainable pipeline of talent will be key to maintaining the dynasty long after LeBron hangs up his sneakers.\n\nThe Legacy of LeBron James\n\nA Lasting Impact\n\nWhen all is said and done, LeBron's legacy with the Lakers will be one of transformation and excellence. He's not just a player; he's a catalyst for change. His impact on the court, in the locker room, and within the community has been profound.\n\nHe's redefined what it means to be a superstar in the modern NBA. His approach to the game, his business savvy, and his social activism have set a new standard.

It's about style, glamour, and the intersection of sports and entertainment. LeBron's arrival in LA has only amplified this.

Let's consider...\n\nConclusion: The King's Reign Continues\n\nIn conclusion, LeBron James' impact on the Los Angeles Lakers has been multifaceted and profound.

          "raw_content": "Larry Brown Sports\n\nBrown Bag it, Baby\n\nThe LeBron Effect: How LeBron James impacted his Lakers teammates\n\n\n\nGiven the monumental impact that star players have in the NBA, the simple fact that basketball is a team game can often get overlooked. One of the defining tests of NBA superstardom is a player’s ability to positively influence his teammates’ play. Stars can improve a teammate’s play through not only their own play, but also their presence; the greatest players of all-time carry an aura with them that embodies winning.\n\nFour-time NBA champion and Finals MVP LeBron James has illustrated this aura throughout the entirety of his 17-year career. James has the power to thrust his teammates into an unfamiliar position — directly in the spotlight.\n\nIf these players deliver when they are called upon, their legacies are cemented next to role players like Steve Kerr, whose famous 1997 Finals-winning shot lives on eternally in the Role Player Hall of Fame. Failure to deliver, however, means a player will be exposed to a level of scrutiny unlike ever before. This phenomenon experienced by James’ teammates can be known as the “LeBron Effect.”\n\nJames’ impact on his teammates is so profound that his influence was felt not just by younger players, but also by accomplished veterans like Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo over last season.\n\nHere is a look at how James impacted the play of his teammates last season.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward, Rondo experience veteran resurgence\n\nBefore their tenures with the Lakers, it seemed both Howard and Rondo were more destined for stardom in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league than a return to their NBA glory. And while a lack of talent was hardly the issue for either of the former All-NBA selections, accountability was.\n\nAfter stops in five different cities over the past five seasons, Dwight Howard arrived in Los Angeles on a last-chance deal. Playing alongside James sparked a newfound commitment to winning in Howard. For the first time in his career, he embraced his ideal role as a rim-protecting screen setter.\n\nEven when Howard was scoring over 20 points a night, he was never a great low post scorer, as most of his offense depended on his otherworldly athleticism. Despite this, Howard adamantly maintained his status among the league leaders in post-ups year after year. During the 2017-18 season (Howard’s last full season before this year), he ranked third in the NBA with 331 field goal attempts off post-ups. Low post scoring requires a soft-touch and grace that has eluded Howard his entire career.\n\nJames and the Lakers unlocked the optimal version of Howard. Instead of stagnating their offense by throwing the ball into a stationary Howard on the low block, Los Angeles leveraged his athleticism and screen-setting ability. In 69 games this season, Howard only attempted 23 shots out of post-ups.\n\nWhile Howard deserves credit for making the long-overdue adjustments to his game, it’s impossible to imagine him embracing a limited role off the bench that didn’t come at the James’ behest.\n\nFor as good as Howard was, Rondo’s resurgence was far more vital to the Lakers’ championship run. James’ greatest impact on Rondo came in the form of trust.\n\nOne of the hardest parts for any great NBA player is determining what responsibilities they can delegate over the course of 48 minutes. For a player with James’ playmaking prowess, conceding touches in the postseason and allowing a teammate to initiate the offense can be risky. But having an unflappable veteran point guard capable of taking the reins of the offense goes a long way in easing that feeling.\n\nRondo averaged 6.6 assists per game in the playoffs and served as the guiding hand for the Lakers’ bench units. In Los Angeles’ Game 4 win in the NBA Finals, Rondo orchestrated the pick and roll that ultimately set up Anthony Davis for the game-sealing three with under a minute remaining. Rondo is unafraid of any moment, and following the Lakers’ defeat in Game 5, he took the onus upon himself to put the Miami Heat away in Game 6.\n\n\n\nRajon Rondo has another ring on his mind.\n\nHe’s 5-5 from the field.\n\n(: @Lakers) pic.twitter.com/YckyMYzAAt\n\n— theScore (@theScore) October 12, 2020\n\n\n\nRondo began the game shooting 5-for-5 as part of a 19-point effort in the series’ closeout game. Aggressive drives in semi-transition opportunities like the one above depict how he sliced through Miami’s defense. As the postseason continued, Rondo looked more comfortable in not only attacking the basket, but also shooting.\n\nFor the playoffs, Rondo shot 40 percent (20-of-50) from three, a vast improvement for the career 31.6 percent long-range shooter. Although it seems highly unlikely that Rondo’s success from deep will translate over the course of an entire season, the threat of a jump shot alone made Rondo far more dangerous in the pick and roll. Even in the games that he did not shoot well, Rondo remained engaged and did the little things crucial for winning.\n\n\n\nEstablishing a name\n\nWhile James helped redefine the narratives surrounding some of the Lakers veterans’ careers, he also helped shape those of the younger Lakers. Alex Caruso went from a beloved meme on NBA Twitter to an invaluable piece capable of locking down opposing perimeter players and hitting timely shots.\n\nIn the 560 regular minutes that James and Caruso shared the floor, Los Angeles outscored their opponents by a staggering 18.6 points per 100 possessions. It did not matter who else occupied the other three spots on the floor, as James and Caruso’s presence in a lineup alone ensured the Lakers’ success.\n\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. While no one has perfected the chase down quite like James, Caruso’s rejection of James Harden on the play below was a visual embodiment of the effort Caruso plays with nightly. Unparalleled energy and passion paired with James’ unwavering confidence in him turned Caruso into a necessary ingredient in the Lakers championship recipe.\n\n\n\nCARUSO CHASEDOWN BLOCK ON HARDEN.\n\n(via @NBATV)pic.twitter.com/Hp0ZQemjZl\n\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 13, 2020\n\n\n\nNo Lakers player felt the negative aspects of the LeBron Effect more than Danny Green. In Game 5, James presented Green with his Steve Kerr opportunity, but history had other plans.\n\nOne missed shot does not define a legacy, but one made shot can. Even though the Lakers still went on to win the series and Green is now a three-time NBA champion, he will likely never get a chance at basketball immortality again. But even for as painful as the miss was, Markieff Morris’ turnover on the play was far more egregious, as James was standing wide open on the wing when Morris heaved the lob pass out of bounds.\n\nWhile James’ latest Finals victory has breathed new life into the G.O.A.T debate, do not expect his approach to falter. As the King continues chasing the legacy of a ghost in Chicago, he must continue to expect the same greatness he requires of himself from his teammates.\n\ni want more great stories!\n\nSign up today for free and get the best sports content sent to your inbox.\n\nYou can unsubscribe anytime.

[+] Barnes on October 31. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\nLeBron James is arguably the most dominant athlete of his generation and has chosen to close out his career playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. It is very early to judge his impact on the Lakers, as they have started at 2-5, but ultimately he will have a dynamic effect on the team, the city and the fan base.\n\nThis may not have as immediate as folks in Los Angeles may like; however, we will inevitably see this \"LeBron Effect\" bless his new team and market in time.\n\n1. Television Ratings — NBA pre-season games have negligible viewership yet a Laker pre-season game drew a 0.7 household rating and 1.17 million viewers per sportsmediawatch.com. The Laker opening game against Houston delivered an impressive 2.0 household rating with 3.36 million viewers on ESPN. That was the largest regular-season NBA draw on ESPN since a 2016 Lakers-Warrior game which was the last game of Kobe Bryant's career and featured the Warriors record-breaking 73rd win. This is only a small preview of the draw that LeBron could garner over the\n\n2. Merchandise — When LeBron's Laker signing was announced, it created a frenzy of jersey sales. Per Fox Business, Fanatics, one of the world's largest sports merchandise retailers, announced that the 24 hours following the announcement resulted in that day breaking sales records and was one of their top 10 sales days. In addition to the apparel, Nike, right on cue, released their sixteenth iteration of LeBron's signature shoe. Nike has released this model in four different colorways so far, including a female-exclusive version made by women for women, which sold out in seconds. Nike also released a Staples Center version in classic Laker purple for the home opener which sold out. LeBron has always been popular and certain colors of specific models in his signature line have been popular, but not to this level. It is clear that his newfound home and enormous star-profile have had mutually beneficial effects, and the hype behind his shoes indicates his athlete approval rating is as high as it has ever been.\n\n3. On-Court Impact on The Team — Even though the Lakers are 2-5 to begin the season, three of the five losses were against legitimate title contenders and the point differential was only five. Last year Brandon Ingram played the small forward position and average 16.1 points, five rebounds and 3.9 assists. LeBron has posted stats of 27.1 points,  9.0 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game which clearly higher than Ingram's numbers for last year. Ingram has been moved to power forward with the addition of LeBron and the trading of Julius Randle, and has better stats this year than last so the adjustment is looking to be beneficial in that respect, already. JaVale McGee, the Lakers' newly acquired Center, is also posting career numbers, which looks to be a direct correlation to the improved ball movement that LeBron's addition brings to the team. He is such a powerful influence on other players, that once they adjust to his presence, the future for the purple and gold is bright.\n\n4. Impact on Other Franchises and Coaches — Historically, every team LeBron has played for has flourished with his presence and has seen a downturn when he leaves. Under Coach Tyron Lue, he led the team to a combined record of 128-77, a win percentage of. Without him, the Cavs lost their first six games and Coach Lue was fired. In his first tenure with the Cavs under Coach Mike Brown, the teams win percentage was 66.3%. LeBron then left for Miami and Coach Brown was fired. At Miami, LeBron posted a 71% win percentage. Since his departure Coach, Erik Spoelstra has a significantly lower winning percentage of 52%. Luke Walton's future is in the hands of the success of the Lakers over the next few years, but Walton and James will eventually catch their stride and get used to one another. Once that happens, it is inevitable that the Lakers will flourish.\n\nLook for the \"LeBron James Effect\" over the course of this season and future seasons, as the Lakers' television ratings, merchandising, and fan base to rise and grow.\n\n"

One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty Images)REGULAR-SEASON STATSJordan was the flashier scorer – 10 scoring titles and the highest career scoring average in NBA history – and the better defender (leading the league in steals three times), while James has been the better playmaker with 106 career regular-season triple-doubles to Jordan’s 28.James wins the longevity argument (with anyone), still playing at an All-NBA level and averaging 30 points per game in his 20th season with clear plans to play at least a few more.

Jordan’s Bulls were favored to win all six times they reached the Finals, but James’ teams were the betting underdog seven of 10 times. He lost one series as the favorite (2011 vs. Dallas) but led his teams to a pair of series wins as the oddsmakers’ underdog (2012 vs. Oklahoma City and 2016 vs. Golden State, when Cleveland memorably erased a 3-1 deficit to beat the 73-9 record-setting Warriors).James … Category … Jordan4 … NBA championships … 64-6 … NBA Finals record … 6-04 … Finals MVPs … 64 … Regular-season MVPs … 518 … All-NBA teams … 116 … All-Defense teams … 90 … Defensive POY … 119 … All-Star teams … 141 … Scoring titles … 103 (1 bronze) … Olympic medals … 2Related Articles\n\n\n\t\t\tLakers’ Luka Doncic says he was talking to a fan when ejected, not a referee\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLakers fall to Thunder after Luka Doncic’s 4th-quarter ejection\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLakers showcased their defensive ceiling in victory over Thunder\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLakers encouraged by ability to step up against league’s best competition\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tLakers cruise to blowout road win over league-best Thunder\n\nFrom the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.\n\n“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”\n\nNow 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).\n\nNo one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):\n\nREGULAR-SEASON STATS\n\nJordan was the flashier scorer – 10 scoring titles and the highest career scoring average in NBA history – and the better defender (leading the league in steals three times), while James has been the better playmaker with 106 career regular-season triple-doubles to Jordan’s 28.\n\nJames wins the longevity argument (with anyone), still playing at an All-NBA level and averaging 30 points per game in his 20th season with clear plans to play at least a few more. We’ll never know where Jordan’s totals would have ended up if not for a pair of early retirements (missing nearly two full seasons when he walked away the first time at age 30).\n\nJames … Avg. per game … Jordan\n\n27.2 … Points … 30.1\n\n7.5 … Rebounds … 6.2\n\n7.3 … Assists … 5.3\n\n1.5 … Steals … 2.3\n\n0.8 … Blocked shots … 0.8\n\n3.5 … Turnovers … 2.7\n\n38.1 … Minutes … 38.3\n\n50.5 … FG% … 49.7\n\n34.4 … 3-point% … 32.7\n\n73.5 … FT% … 83.5\n\nREGULAR-SEASON STATS (Totals)\n\nJames … Category … Jordan\n\n1,409 … Games … 1,072\n\n38,352 … Points … 32,292\n\n10,576 … Rebounds … 6,672\n\n10,351 … Assists … 5,633\n\n2,176 … Steals … 2,514\n\n1,065 … Blocked shots … 893\n\n4,922 … Turnovers … 2,924\n\n53,708 … Minutes … 41,011\n\nREGULAR-SEASON ADVANCED STATS\n\nThe advanced stats are split, with Value Over Replacement (VORP) and Win Shares favoring James, but Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Plus/Minus on Jordan’s side of the ledger.\n\nJames … Category … Jordan\n\n27.3 … Player Efficiency Rating (PER) … 27.9\n\n145.9 … Value Over Replacement (VORP) … 116.1\n\n8.8 … Box score Plus/Minus … 9.2\n\n254.3 … Win Shares … 214.0\n\n58.8 … True Shooting % … 56.9\n\n31.6 … Usage % … 33.3\n\nPLAYOFF STATS\n\nNot surprisingly, two all-world performers in the regular season have also been dominant in the postseason.

James has 28 career 40-point games in the playoffs and one 50-point game in the 2018 NBA Finals.

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

It also made him realize that the game is much more than fancy scoring and playmaking.

With 4 regular-season MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, and 3 championships in his career so far, he's already one of the greatest ever to play the sport of basketball.\n\nKyrie says playing with KD is the first time he's been able to defer late in games 👀 (via @boardroom | @boardroompods) pic.twitter.com/qkJG5L9o2y\n\nDespite his illustrious career, King James is sometimes criticized for his performance during clutch moments. Recently, Kyrie Irving, LeBron James' former teammate, took a dig at James and inferred that he (Irving) has never had any teammates in the past who could hit big shots down the stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 5 clutch moments of LeBron James' career:\n\nIn this article, we'll take a look at 5 of the most clutch playoff moments of LeBron James' career.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\n#5. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The Chicago Bulls posed a serious threat to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n#TBT to when LeBron James hit a game-winning buzzer-beater over Jimmy Butler and the Bulls in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semis. pic.twitter.com/VurMVnw3oz\n\nIn Game 4, with the scores tied at 84-84 and with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, LeBron James hit a deep 2 from the corner over Jimmy Butler to help Cleveland level the series. The Cavs went on to win the series 4-2 and reached the NBA Finals that year.\n\n#4. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost the Game 1 against the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOn this date in 2009, LeBron James hit his 1st playoff buzzer-beater to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a 96-95 win over the Orlando Magic in Game 2 of the '09 Eastern Conf. Finals.Orlando, however, would go on to win the series in 6 games. pic.twitter.com/tOZJzfFLPN\n\nDown 2 points in Game 2 with just 1 second left, the Cavaliers were at the risk of going down 0-2 in the series. LeBron James collected an inbound pass a few feet outside the 3-point line and nailed a high-arcing shot to beat the buzzer.\n\nThough Magic went on to win the series in 6, this buzzer-beater from James remains one of the most memorable moments of his storied career.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: The dream starting 5 for the Portland Trail Blazers going into the 2020-21 season\n\n#3. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers, First Round, Game 5, 2018\n\nIn 2018, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers came closer than ever to upsetting the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, Oladipo had the ball in his hand with the scores tied at 95.\n\n.@KingJames WINS IT AT THE BUZZER! 🚨😱Pacers vs. Cavaliers, 2018 Eastern Conference 1st Round Game 5 - 2pm ET on NBA TV! pic.twitter.com/88wPXvteqp\n\nWhat happened next remains as one of the best sequence of plays ever on both ends of the court. LeBron James blocked a layup attempt with 3 seconds left on the clock and drilled a deep 3 to beat the buzzer on the other side. The Cavaliers went on to win the series in 7 games.\n\n#2. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2013\n\nThe Miami Heat were one game away from winning back-to-back NBA championships in 2013. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, there was nothing to split the teams up until 3 quarters.\n\n7 years ago today, LeBron did this to the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals! 37 PTS5-10 3PT12 REB4 AST2 STLBack-to-back champs! pic.twitter.com/ccoz02gUll\n\nLeBron James took over in the final quarter as he went on to score 16 points in the final 12 minutes. He went 7-11 in the quarter, and also hit a clutch jumper to extend Miami's lead to 4 points with just 28 seconds left on the clock.\n\n#1. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2016\n\nCleveland Cavaliers pulled off the impossible in 2016 against the mighty Golden State Warriors. After being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, the Cavs came back all guns blazing and won the next 3 games to win their first title in franchise history.\n\nLeBron’s block, Kyrie’s dagger, Cleveland’s title. 🏆Game 7 of the 2016 Finals was epic.

The Warriors' Andre Iguodala was about the give them the lead in what seemed like an easy layup at the rim.\n\nThis is when LeBron James made an incredible run from the other side of the court, and leaped as high as anyone could to block the shot off the backboard. To this day, this remains arguably the best block in NBA history.\n\nAmith Sreedhar\n\nAmith is an avid basketball and tennis fan who has been actively associated with Sportskeeda during the 2020 NBA season.\n\nApart from writing about sports, Amith has attended numerous tennis tournaments and NBA games in the United States and hopes to do it more often in the future.\n\nWhen not watching decade-old Roger Federer highlights on Youtube, Amith loves traveling and hiking in the mountains\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

The results would be a little different, even if nearly a quarter of the anonymous, 26-player poll thought that LeBron would go down as the greatest player of all time.\n\nLeBron's battle against the clutch has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years—Dan Favale has a great piece on his evolution here at B/R—but there's no more room for debate. He thrives when the going gets tough.\n\nDeciding Shots with the Shot Clock Turned Off\n\nBefore expanding the definition of \"clutch\" to include more types of plays, let's first take a look at what happens on shots to either tie or take the lead during the final 24 seconds of either the fourth quarter or an overtime period.\n\nIs there any moment more crucial? The ball is in a player's hands, and he has the opportunity to either ensure victory or defeat. According to Miami Heat beat writer Tim Reynolds, LeBron was pretty darn good in those situations.\n\nNot only did he make the most shots—far more than a certain member of the Los Angeles Lakers—but he also shot 41.2 percent from the field. You have to re-contextualize here, as defensive intensity ramps up in these situations. A lower field-goal percentage is to be expected when the game is on the line, and it should be rather telling that only Kevin Durant's mark beat LeBron's.\n\nBut these players aren't the only ones who can take game-deciding shots. They can also pass the ball to teammates and have them do the dirty work. It's a concept that not too many superstars are familiar with, as \"hero ball\" has unfortunately taken over as the method du jour when the contest is on the line.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of a game in which the player's team was tied or behind by three points or fewer, no one in the NBA recorded more assists than LeBron. He, Nicolas Batum and Andre Miller each produced four assists, and LeBron did so while keeping his sheet free from any of those pesky little turnovers.\n\nPaul Pierce was the only other player from Reynolds' tweet to avoid a goose egg in the assist column, and he checked in with two dimes.\n\nThe league MVP is already at the forefront of the discussion when isolating scoring, but he pulls ahead by an even wider margin as soon as his elite passing is brought into the conversation. During the 2012-13 season, you wanted the ball in his hands when the game was truly on the line.\n\nBut now let's expand the definition of clutch to be much more inclusive, thus raising the sample size enough to draw more conclusions.\n\nRaises Performance During the Final Minutes of Close Games\n\nI wrote a recent article about why it's so important Dwyane Wade fully cedes the alpha-dog role to his talented teammate, but it's worth bringing up again.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, there are going to be two different definitions of clutch. \"Clutch 1\" will be considered the last five minutes of a game when teams are separated by five points or fewer, and \"Clutch 2\" will be the last 30 seconds of a one-possession game, regardless of which team was ahead at the time.\n\nIf you look at per-36-minute numbers, LeBron has consistently raised his game as the going gets tougher:\n\nAssuming that you could extrapolate his Clutch 2 numbers to a full 36 minutes of action (an admittedly faulty assumption since things change in a one-possession game), LeBron would put up a triple-double while scoring over 60 points. That's pure insanity.\n\nLebron James' per-36-minute numbers are impressive enough over the course of a contest. But when we enter into Clutch 1 and Clutch 2 situations, he just goes berserk. He scores with reckless abandon—especially when he decides to start attacking the rim—gets everyone involved, and crashes the boards with a fury.\n\nNo one else does that to the same extent. And the trend carries over to the postseason as well. In Clutch 1 situations, LeBron averaged 26.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 11.5 assists per 36 minutes while shooting 44 percent from the field. All of the counting stats are higher than his normal playoff numbers, and the field-goal percentage was only slightly lower.\n\nHowever, in Clutch 2 situations during last year's postseason, he completely changed his style of play. He met the criteria in six games, and while he didn't record a single rebound or assist, he did manage to average 55.2 points per 36 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThere was just no decline.\n\nTriple-Double and Game-Winner in the Postseason\n\nAnd speaking of the postseason, how about the fact that LeBron is the only player to record both a triple-double and hit a game-winner in the same playoff game, as he did against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe truly made history when he beat Paul George to the hoop for a relatively easy left-handed layup last Eastern Conference Finals, cementing his legacy as a player who could come up big when the moments got tougher.\n\nNow for the rest of this article, I'm going to be changing the definition of \"clutch\" once more. Throughout each of the next three sections, it will be defined as the last five minutes of a game when the contest is separated by less than five points, and only players who met those criteria in at least 10 games (while playing two or more minutes per contest) during 2012-13 will be included.\n\nIt's a rather broad definition, but, again, it's a necessary one so that we can have at least a fairly substantial sample size.\n\nAcross-the-Board Greatness\n\nOne of the things that makes LeBron so special is his impact in all major categories during the closing minutes of a game. In fact, no player has as big of an across-the-board impact.\n\nObviously, it's hard to play a lot of minutes in this type of clutch situation because, by definition, it's just five minutes in any game unless there's an overtime or two. So keep that in mind when you see numbers that are far lower than you might expect.\n\nLeBron didn't score the most points per game in this type of clutch situation, but he wasn't far off the mark.\n\nThat wasn't the only area in which he excelled, even if Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving were the only ones in the above graph with higher field-goal percentages. LeBron also crashed the boards quite often during the closing minutes of tight games.\n\nThink we're done yet? Think again. Assists matter too!\n\nLeBron and Rajon Rondo were in a league of their own when it came to passing the ball during the closing stretch of a tight game. They were both willing and able to find openings in the suffocating defenses thrown at them, and the rest of the league just wasn't even close.\n\nNow, how many of the 15 names are repeats? The answer is rather simple: only one.\n\nLeBron appears on all three graphs, and no other player in the NBA finds himself on more than a single top-five leaderboard. He's an elite scorer, rebounder and distributor when the pressure cooker is turned up to its highest notch.\n\nLiterally, no one else can say that. And did this change in the postseason? Of course not!\n\nOnce the playoffs rolled around, the Heat star finished No. 1 in clutch scoring, No. 4 in rebounding (behind Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw), and No. 7 in assists (trailing Kirk Hinrich, Russell Westbrook, Josh Smith, Manu Ginobili, Mike Conley and Luol Deng).\n\nStill pretty darn elite.\n\nPIE vs. Winning Percentage\n\nPlayer impact estimate (PIE) hasn't entered the collective consciousness of NBA fans yet, but it's a wonderful tool used by NBA.com to show how involved a player is. Instead of usage rate, which omits assists, rebounds and anything that doesn't finish a play, PIE \"measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in.\"\n\nDuring clutch situations, no player had a higher PIE than LeBron's 29.7. He was just ultra-involved in the contest at all times, more so than Kobe Bryant (26.5), Kevin Durant (24.3), James Harden (23.3) and everyone else.\n\nBut, that's only good if it results in success. Being highly involved can be a bad thing if wins aren't the result.\n\nFor that reason, I've put together this graph, which correlates PIE (X-axis) with winning percentage (Y-axis) for the 20 most \"involved\" players in the NBA:\n\nThat's a pretty telling image, as LeBron both had the highest winning percentage and the most involvement. He's the dot in the top right, and he's joined at 80 percent on the Y-axis by his teammate, Chris Bosh.\n\nNo one else is close in either category. But now, let's break it down even further and look at his involvement in the Heat's scoring plays.\n\nInvolvement in Scoring Plays\n\nTwo new stats are relevant here: percent assisted and percent field goals made.\n\nThe former represents the number of made shots by teammates that were assisted by the player in question when he was on the court, and the latter shows the percentage of made field goals credited to the player when he was playing.\n\nAt this point, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that LeBron James was elite in both categories during crunch time among those who played at least 20 games that met the parameters.\n\nIn fact, he finished fifth in percent assisted, behind only Ricky Rubio, Rajon Rondo, Will Bynum and Raymond Felton. As for percent field goals made, he was significantly lower, but still doing pretty well for himself with at 15th.\n\nBut let's take this a step beyond and combine the two to show overall involvement in scoring plays, something that I'm just going to call percent scoring. It's calculated rather easily, just by adding percent assisted to percent field goals made.\n\nAs you might expect, LeBron is right near the top of the leaderboard:\n\nLeBron and Kobe should stand out to you. The rest are all point guards—yes, that's Will Bynum benefiting from a small sample size, not Andrew Bynum—which makes sense, because floor generals are naturally more involved in the playmaking.\n\nThere's also a major benefit gained from being a superstar on a lackluster team. That's giving Kyrie Irving and Jrue Holiday an artificial boost, as there simply weren't other intriguing options on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.\n\nFor those reasons, you should be most impressed by LeBron, Kobe and CP3, considering their teammates.\n\nAnd across the board, you should just be in awe of how great LeBron is with the game on the line. Although there's already a large gap between him and the rest of the league no matter how much time is left on the clock, there's an even larger disparity when nearing the final buzzer in a tight game.\n\nHis scoring prowess, willingness to make the right play, and consistent ability to come out on top make him stand out in a big way.\n\nGo ahead—keep denying LeBron's ability to come up big when it counts. The rest of us will be over here trying to contain our laughter.\n\nNote: All stats, unless otherwise indicated, come from NBA.com's statistical databases, and all graphics were created with Infogr.am.\n\n"

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

Introduction\nThe debate of who is basketball’s GOAT has been ongoing for years, with fans and analysts comparing the two players’ skills, achievements, and impact on the game. Both Jordan and James have left a lasting legacy in the NBA, making it a difficult decision for many to determine who is the greatest of all time. While Jordan is often praised for his six championships and unbeatable competitive spirit, James has also garnered respect for his versatility and longevity in the league. Ultimately, the GOAT debate may never have a definitive answer, as both players have solidified their places in basketball history.\nMichael Jordan, known for his 6 NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, is often praised for his scoring ability and competitiveness. On the other hand, LeBron James, a 4-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Los Angeles Lakers, is recognized for his versatility and playmaking skills on the court.\nOur aim is to try and inform your decision on who is your G.O.A.T. with all the right statistics and background information. This paper will analyze various aspects of both players’ careers, including statistics, accolades, and impact on the game, in order to provide a comprehensive comparison. Ultimately, we hope to shed light on the ongoing debate and help readers make an informed decision on who they believe is the greatest basketball player of all time.\nPrime Lebron James & Michael Jordan\n\nII. Early Life and Career Beginnings: Michael Jordan\nMichael Jordan’s childhood begins in the town of Wilmington, North Carolina where he moved at a young age after being birthed in Brooklyn, New York. He was a stellar multi-sport athlete in the sports baseball, football, and basketball but that wasn’t enough for his hometown high school of Emsley A. Laney High School. He was cut from the school varsity team in his sophomore year but soon made it back as their star athlete. After high school he played in the NCAA where he led his team to a D1 championship in only his freshman year. The following years as both a sophomore & junior he was named the NCAA college player of the year which added to his early collection of accolades. The only reason his stellar college run was cut short was because he left to join the NBA. Jordan, part of the ‘84 draft class, was drafted 3rd overall  by the Chicago Bulls.\nJordan’s school picture day at his Elementary School\n\nII. Early Life and Career Beginnings: LeBron James\nLebron James’s childhood was difficult to say the least. He was born to an ex-con for a father and to his mom, Gloria, when she was only 16 years old. Early in his life, he moved 6+ times, missing over a 100 days of school which showed that his parent(s) never paid attention to his education, shedding a spotlight on how he was led to sports. His first sport played was Football, which Lebron saw as his favorite sport when he was young. Finally warming up to his life, he was forced to move again. He led his hometown Akron basketball team to three state titles and was named “Mr. Basketball” in Ohio for three straight years. He decided not to go to college and went straight to the NBA where he was the number 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers, his path to success got off to a rocky but strong start.\n-Sports Illustrated\n\nIII. Career Achievements\nEarly on Jordan demonstrated his prowess by averaging 28.2 points a game winning rookie of the year (ROTY). He won his first championship in 1991 and went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to two three-peats in the 1990s. He then “having no more to prove” retired in October 1993 to go play for a minor league baseball team. One season later he returned to the Bulls late in the 1994-95 season to lead them to another 3 championships in the years ’96-98. He retired for a second time in January 1999. He went on to buy a share of the Washington Wizards and also became the president of basketball operations on the team. He returned to basketball again to join the Wizards and became the first player aged 40+ to score more than 40 PPG. Jordan’s final retirement from basketball appeared in May 2003.Overall, Jordan made 6 finals appearances with a total of 6 finals wins.\nTotals: Six-time NBA champion (1991-93, 1996-98); MVP (1988, ’91, ’92, ’96, ’98); 10-time All-NBA First Team (1987-93, 1996-98); All-NBA Second Team (1985); Defensive Player of the Year (1988); Nine-time All-Defensive First Team (1988-93, 1996-98); Rookie of the Year (1985); 14-time All-Star; All-Star MVP (1988, ’96, ’98); One of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (’96); Olympic gold medalist (1984, ’92).\nLebron’s first championship came in 2012 with the Miami Heat with 27.1 PPG, followed by two more with the Heat in 2013 and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, solidifying his status as one of the greatest players of all time. Additionally, his four MVP awards showcase his consistent excellence and impact on the game throughout his career. Lebron had a total of 10 Finals appearances, which he won 4 out of showcasing his capability to fight to the top even without as much support as other teams have had.\nLeBron James has been selected to the All-Star game a total of 17 times, further highlighting his dominance and impact on the league. He has also won one scoring title in 2008, displaying his versatility and ability to excel in different aspects of the game. In comparison, Jordan has been selected to the All-Star game 14 times and has won 10 scoring titles, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – Jordan\n\nOff the court, Michael Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and his global brand cannot be understated. His influence transcends the sport, as seen through his successful Jordan Brand which continues to be a powerhouse in the world of sneakers and apparel. Jordan’s legacy extends far beyond his playing days, solidifying his status as a true icon in both sports and popular culture. The Jordan brand’s roots actually come from his parents. Not only did Jordan not begin with Nike, he actually started the deal with Converse & Adidas. Adidas was known as Jordan’s personal favorite, but when Nike offered him 250,000 – more than double Adidas offered – and a signature shoe, his parents urged him to take the deal. There are now 39 main flagship models with thousands of styles. Jordan serves as an inspiration no matter where he is to both NBA players and children alike. His skills and increasing influence led fans not only in the USA, but also across the entire world to hear of his prowess and in turn boost television viewership. Finally, by becoming a stake in the Charlotte Hornets, this showcased his commitment to not only playing but also coaching the new generation of basketball.\n\nA public school founded by LeBron James in Akron, Ohio.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – LeBron\nConversely, Lebron has had tremendous impact, exemplified by his nickname King James, or the Chosen One. His records are seemingly unbreakable with over 40 thousand points in the regular season, additionally, James has scored 40+ points against all 30 teams.  His philanthropy has taken roots in higher education, mentoring, advocacy, after-school programs, and early childhood development or learning. The LeBron James Family Foundation has raised over 100 Million for these causes. Finally, LeBron, after struggling with poverty as a child, works towards better education for those children now. As LeBron James has not retired yet, his influence is only yet to grow and the rest is history.\n\nV. Conclusion\nOverall, Lebron and Jordan have both made significant contributions to society through their philanthropic efforts and social activism. While Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and global brand is undeniable, LeBron has also used his platform to create positive change in the world. Both players have left a lasting legacy that extends beyond the basketball court, solidifying their status as true icons in sports and popular culture. Finally, it all comes down to personal preference and interpretation of the facts.

The most accurate portrayal of generational talents may very well be the dynamic between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\nBorn just over 20 years apart, Jordan and James came within months of overlapping in the NBA. Jordan played his final game in April 2003 and James was selected first overall in the NBA Draft two months later.\nFor the better part of the last 40 seasons, one of Jordan or James has been the face of the league, rewriting the history books with unprecedented levels of excellence. As a result, the two are often mentioned in the conversation as the greatest players to ever play the game.\nWho is the greatest of all time? The Sporting News takes a look at the career stats and accolades of James and Jordan to find an answer to one of sports' age-old debates.\nSN's NBA HQ: Live NBA scores | Updated NBA standings | Full NBA schedule\nWhy LeBron James is the NBA's GOAT\nEntering his 22nd season, James has turned in the greatest career in NBA history.\nAn unprecedented run of longevity has seen James continue to perform at an All-NBA level for the entirety of his career, and he will enter his age 40 season as one of the league's best players. As a result, James is rewriting the NBA's record book with untouchable marks.\nAfter becoming the league's all-time leading scorer in 2023, James became the first player in NBA history to surpass the 40,000 career point mark during the 2023-24 season.\nJames' 22nd NBA season will tie the record previously set by Vince Carter and he has an outside shot of also playing in the most games in NBA history. James holds the record for most All-NBA selections and All-Star Game selections with 20 and stands to add to that tally in 2024-25.\nPerhaps the most impressive aspect of James' career is that he has somehow exceeded unprecedented expectations placed upon him as a teenager. James entered the national spotlight as a 16-year-old and has spent the last 25 years thriving in it.\nJames' list of accolades is highlighted by four NBA titles and four NBA Finals MVP awards. While some may hold James' 4-6 Finals record against him, it says something that he has led three different franchises to the NBA Finals a total of 10 times, including a run of eight consecutive Finals appearances with the Heat and Cavaliers from 2011 to 2018.\nWhile many other all-time greats bowed out earlier in the postseason, James-led teams have come within at least four wins of an NBA title six times. How could you penalize him for that?\nMORE: Lakers expectations for JJ Redick are 'a little bit crazy,' says former coach\nAs for James' wins, some championships hold more weight than others. After winning back-to-back titles with the Heat in 2012 and 2013, James returned to Cleveland in 2014 and, after coming up short in Year 1, led the Cavs to one of the most impressive championships in NBA history.\nThe 2016 Cavaliers are the first — and only — NBA team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals, doing so against a Warriors team that won an NBA-record 73 games in the regular season. James' Herculean efforts in that series allowed his team to make history and end a 52-year playoff drought for the city of Cleveland, adding even more meaning for James, a native of Northeast Ohio.\nIt's also worth mentioning that his next two Finals losses came to the Warriors, who improved on that 73-win team by replacing Harrison Barnes with Kevin Durant. James has come up short against some of the best teams ever assembled.\nThat championship win in 2016 was James' magnum opus. Leading the Lakers to a championship in 2020 was yet another title that held extra meaning.\nIn winning a championship during the NBA bubble in Orlando, James earned a seat at the table of Lakers lore and delivered the city of Los Angeles a title in a year where it had experienced unfathomable loss.\nSet aside the longevity, numbers and accolades for a moment, and James' GOAT case is rooted in a simple argument: there is no greater basketball player to have ever played the game. At 6-9 and 250 pounds, James is one of the most physically imposing players, blending his size with one-of-a-kind strength, athleticism and basketball IQ.\nHis scoring and passing are both generational and at his peak, he is one of the stingiest and most versatile defenders to ever play the game. James checks each box of what a great basketball player does well and for the better part of his career, he did them at an all-time level.

At the forefront of this conversation are two iconic figures: LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan. Each has left an indelible mark on the NBA, redefining the standards of greatness in their own eras. As we delve into the intricate details of their careers, statistics, and impact on the game, we aim to answer the burning question: Who is the real G.O.A.T?\nCareer Averages and Scoring Records\nOne of the primary metrics in the G.O.A.T debate is scoring prowess. Michael Jordan, renowned for his scoring ability, boasts a career average of 30.1 points per game, a mark that LeBron James, with his 27.2 points per game, has yet to surpass. However, the debate takes an intriguing turn when considering the overall impact on the team. LeBron’s additional assists per game have contributed to more points for his teams, making the scoring comparison more nuanced.\nCareer Points and Longevity\nLeBron James recently etched his name in the history books by becoming the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, surpassing the legendary Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. This achievement adds a layer of complexity to the debate. While Jordan reached significant scoring milestones earlier in his career, LeBron’s longevity and consistent performance indicate that he might extend the gap in total career points. The question now arises: Will LeBron’s record be out of reach, and could he potentially breach the 40,000 or even 45,000 career points mark?\nGames Played and Load Management\nThe dynamics of the NBA have evolved over the years, introducing the concept of “load management.” Michael Jordan’s era saw him play all 82 regular-season games in nine out of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons during the Bulls’ last three championship runs. In contrast, LeBron James, adapting to the modern approach, has played all 82 games only once in his 20-year career. The debate over load management and its impact on each player’s career adds an extra layer to the G.O.A.T conversation.\nEfficiency and Shooting Prowess\nEfficiency on the court is a critical aspect of any player’s legacy. Examining points per shot attempt, LeBron James has consistently maintained a high level of efficiency throughout his career. Even when facing top defenders, he has managed to stay above the league average. In contrast, Michael Jordan experienced fluctuations in efficiency, falling below the league average multiple times. LeBron’s ability to score efficiently, even against strong defenses, provides a compelling argument in the G.O.A.T debate.\nAdvanced Metrics\nThe advent of advanced metrics has brought a new dimension to the G.O.A.T conversation. Metrics such as Value Over Replacement (VORP) and Win Shares attempt to balance differences in eras and showcase a player’s overall value. LeBron James leads the G.O.A.T race in VORP, outpacing not only Michael Jordan but also every other player in NBA history by a significant margin. These advanced metrics shed light on the impact each player had beyond traditional statistics.\nPlayoffs Performance\nThe true measure of greatness often lies in a player’s ability to shine on the grandest stage—the NBA Playoffs. Michael Jordan’s playoff performances are etched in basketball lore, highlighted by his remarkable scoring average of 33.4 points per game. LeBron James, while trailing in scoring, has consistently demonstrated his prowess in rebounds and assists during the postseason. The misconception that LeBron “shrinks” in big games is dispelled by his impressive playoff performances, often surpassing his regular-season feats.\nPlayoffs Totals and Advanced Stats\nDelving deeper into playoff totals and advanced stats provides a more comprehensive understanding of each player’s impact in the postseason. LeBron James, having played more playoff games, has surpassed Jordan in total points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and minutes. Advanced playoff metrics, including Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Box Plus/Minus, reveal a close competition, with Jordan leading in some categories and LeBron in others. These stats further fuel the G.O.A.T debate, making it a nuanced discussion beyond simple championship counts.\nAccolades and Awards\nThe hardware collected throughout a player’s career often serves as a tangible representation of their impact on the game. Michael Jordan’s six NBA championships, all secured without the need for a Game 7, stand as a testament to his dominance in the 1990s. LeBron James, with four NBA championships and a more diverse journey across multiple teams, has controlled the Eastern Conference for nearly a decade. The comparison of MVP awards, Finals MVPs, All-NBA selections, and other accolades adds another layer to the G.O.A.T debate.\nLegacy Beyond Basketball\nThe impact of Michael Jordan and LeBron James extends far beyond the basketball court. Jordan’s influence on popular culture, evident in the global phenomenon of the Air Jordan brand, transcends the sport. LeBron, known for his philanthropy and activism, has utilized his platform to address social issues and inspire change. The comparison of their off-court legacies raises questions about the criteria for evaluating greatness and whether it should be confined to on-court achievements.\nThe Unfinished Business\nAs LeBron James continues to add to his illustrious career, the question of unfinished business looms large. At 38, LeBron is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired. With the potential for more championships, the pursuit of 40,000 career points, and the possibility of playing alongside his son in the NBA, LeBron’s narrative is far from concluded. These potential future achievements could reshape the G.O.A.T conversation and introduce new elements to consider.\nConclusion\nThe debate over whether LeBron James or Michael Jordan deserves the title of the greatest basketball player of all time is a complex and multifaceted discussion. Each player brings a unique set of skills, achievements, and impact on and off the court. From scoring records to advanced metrics, from playoff performances to accolades, the comparison reveals a closely contested battle with no clear-cut winner.\nkhizer.hussain\nMeet Khizer Hussain, our standout sports analyst, here to guide you beyond the numbers on the scoreboard.

LeBron James is clearly still the best player in the world, and the only thing he has yet to prove is to exceed the Michael Jordan comparison. While LeBron James is a completely different player to MJ and plays a different position, the debate will always be there as Jordan is considered the greatest player of all time and the standard for all great players.\nOne topic of comparison is always the competition both legends faced and the road they took to winning NBA championships. Jordan has 6 rings compared to LeBron's 4, but LeBron might have had the tougher competition when narrowing down each Finals' appearance. However, Jordan might have faced the best all-around players in his 6 Finals appearances whereas LeBron played better teams. Nonetheless, it is time to capture each player's NBA Finals appearances by assessing the competition.\nMichael Jordan\n\n1991 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Magic Johnson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Vlade Divac (Hall of Famer), James Worthy (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team)\nMJ's first NBA Finals appearance was a positive one, as was the case for all of MJ's NBA rings. Jordan and the Bulls led the charge against legendary point guard Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. In a showdown between the 2 best players in the era, this was an amazing series whereby Jordan stamped his mark on the league. MJ and the Bulls fell in Game 1, before closing out the series in 5. MJ was the key player all series long, with Scottie Pippen adding in a sensational 32-point game in Game 5 to help MJ close it out. The Lakers finished 3rd in the league that season compared to the Bulls finishing first, and the Jordan era officially began in the 1991 Finals.\n1992 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Clyde Drexler (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Buck Williams (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis is known as the series where Michael Jordan took things personally. Clyde Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1st seed in the Western Conference against the 1st seeded Chicago Bulls. Drexler was thought to be at least equal competition to Michael Jordan, which MJ wanted to prove wrong. Drexler held his own with sensational performances in the series, but MJ had too many key moments such as hitting 6 threes in the 1st quarter of Game 1 and then dropping 33 points in a closeout Game 6. Jordan would simply not allow the series to go to 7, as he was ruthless in making it clear Drexler doesn't come close to his greatness.\n1993 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Charles Barkley (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Dan Majerle (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis was probably the toughest opponent for Michael Jordan. Led by league MVP Charles Barkley, the Suns had the best record in the West while Chicago fell to the #2 seed. As great as Barkley and defensive specialist Dan Majerle were, Jordan and the Bulls were just better. The Bulls took the first 2 games of the series before Phoenix won in 3-OT in Game 3. Jordan responded with 55 points in Game 4 before he made the iconic pass to John Paxson for the game-winning three. Barkley was a dominant player in the series but Jordan was near perfection all series long and he once again did not allow for a Game 7.\n1996 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Gary Payton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Shawn Kemp (All-NBA 2nd Team)\nAfter a brief retirement, Michael Jordan returned to the NBA to continue the MJ-era. Jordan wasn't going away anytime soon, and he led the charge against defensive phenom Gary Payton and athletic glass cleaner Shawn Kemp. MJ and the Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season, as they went to battle with the number one seed in the West. The Bulls were up 3-0 in the series before Payton and Kemp fought back to win 2 straight. Jordan struggled from the floor in Game 6 shooting 5-19, but he had enough help from Pippen and Rodman to close out the series and win Finals MVP in yet another Game 6 closeout.\n1997 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team, All-NBA 2nd Defensive Team)\nMJ and the Bulls made their 5th straight NBA Finals appearance against Karl Malone and John Stockton, who led the Jazz to the best record in the Western Conference. The Bulls won the first 2 games before Utah evened it up in 4. In the legendary \"Flu Game\", Jordan dropped 38 points and willed Chicago to victory in one of the most iconic moments. Jordan then had another iconic moment when he found Steve Kerr for the game-winning shot to capture his 5th title and 5th Finals MVP. Stockton and Malone were a great duo and this presented a massive challenge to MJ and the Bulls, so Jordan's unselfishness in Game 6 was one of his greatest moments.\n1998 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer)\nWas there ever any doubt that Jordan would reach the Finals again? He already had one 3-peat with the Bulls and wanted to do it again. The #1 seeded Bulls led the charge against the #1 seeded Utah Jazz led by Hall of Fame duo Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone and Stockton had taken Game 1 before Chicago answered with 3 straight victories. After Utah stole Game 5, Jordan had one of the most iconic moments in history by stripping Karl Malone on one end and hit the game-winning shot over Bryon Russell to capture his 6th NBA title and 6th Finals MVP.\nLeBron James\n\n2007 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Bruce Bowen (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron's first Finals appearance did not go as he planned, mainly because he was outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Spurs were simply a better team than the Cavaliers as they had 3 Hall of Famers playing under a Hall of Fame coach. Bruce Bowen also made an All-NBA Defensive Team which made life particularly difficult for LeBron in this series. This was a tough series for LeBron as the Cavs were swept, and LeBron does get a pass for most people on this one.\n2011 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Dirk Nowitzki (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Jason Kidd (Hall of Famer), Tyson Chandler (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron's 2nd Finals' appearance also did not go as planned. He had a Superteam with the Miami Heat with the likes of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh by his side, and they were the heavy favorites coming into the series. In possibly the most shocking way, LeBron played much below his usual level and the Heat were beaten in 6 games by the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki was the best player during the playoffs and LeBron James was nowhere near as great. This is a big black mark on LeBron's legendary career for sure.\n2012 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Russell Westbrook (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), James Harden (Hall of Famer), Serge Ibaka (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron James made amends for his prior Finals appearance disaster by leading the Heat Superteam against the Oklahoma City Thunder who had their own younger Superteam. Led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder had athleticism and youth on their side along with an exceptional 6th man in James Harden and an All-NBA Defensive Team player in Serge Ibaka. The Heat were simply too good with their Big Three, and LeBron James finally played like the best player in the series to win his first NBA title.\n2013 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer)\nLeBron's 2nd NBA title came against the San Antonio Spurs, who should have beaten LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Known as the series where Ray Allen made the most clutch shot in NBA history, the Heat fought back and won the series despite being down 3-2. LeBron James was once again the best player in the series, and he willed his team to victory in this series against 4 Hall of Fame Spurs players. Head coach Gregg Popovich forced LeBron to beat them with jumpers, and he did that on his way to winning his 2nd straight Finals MVP.\n2014 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer, All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron James once again was in the Finals with the Miami Heat for the 4th time in a row, this time falling short to the Spurs who exacted their revenge. The Spurs were on a mission this season and the growth of Kawhi Leonard into a star helped San Antonio blow out the Heat in the series. Leonard won Finals MVP, and LeBron could not do enough to counter the Spurs' new Big Four. Dwyane Wade looked older in this series and LeBron James had to settle for another Finals loss in his record.\n2015 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Andrew Bogut (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nOnce again, LeBron James made the Finals this time with his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers. With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love by his side, LeBron James made the Cavs the favorite in the Eastern Conference. Making it all the way to the Finals, they are up against Stephen Curry and the revolutionary Warriors team who introduced the small-ball lineup with Andre Iguodala playing the power forward spot. Unfortunately for LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injures leaving him to fend off the Big Three Warriors by himself. He had a sensational series, but the Warriors had too much with Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP over LeBron James and sending him home with a loss.\n2016 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nThe greatest achievement in LeBron's career came in the 2016 NBA Finals, whereby he played the Warriors against this time with a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Cavs were down 3-1 in the series, and it looked like LeBron would have to suffer yet another loss in the Finals. But he took his game to another level, and alongside Kyrie Irving, were too dominant for the Warriors as they won the NBA title in a historic comeback. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the series, although Kyrie Irving hit the biggest shot of the game in Game 7 to win the series.\n2017 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs once again made the NBA Finals to play the Warriors, except Golden State added superstar player Kevin Durant to join their Big Three of Curry, Thompson, and Green. LeBron still had Irving and Love, but the Warriors were just unstoppable with Kevin Durant as they beat down the Cavs convincingly. LeBron held his own and would have been Finals MVP in the victory, but Durant and the Warriors were too dominant on both ends as KD won Finals MVP and added the 5th Finals loss to LeBron's record.\n2018 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs made the NBA Finals yet again, this time without Kyrie Irving who was traded to Boston. It is a shame LeBron did not have his little brother Irving by his side because their duo was truly exciting to watch. Without Irving, LeBron had to lead average players to battle against the Golden State Warriors juggernaut led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. In one of the most embarrassing Finals moments in history, J.R. Smith dribbled out the clock instead of helping the Cavs snatch Game 1. LeBron put forth a Goliath 50-point performance that went to waste, effectively ending the series the Cavs lost 4-0.\n2020 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Jimmy Butler (All-NBA 3rd Team), Bam Adebayo (All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nWith LeBron's 3rd NBA team, he won his 4th NBA title. While certainly not the toughest opponent that LeBron faced and the easiest challenge in both MJ's and LeBron's competition, James and the Lakers beat the Heat in 6 games. LeBron James had Anthony Davis by his side, while Jimmy Butler was left to fend for himself as both Bam Adebayo and starting point guard Goran Dragic were out with injuries. Butler held his own with iconic performances, but LeBron and Davis were the best duo in the NBA and the Lakers were too good for any team in the league. While LeBron's easiest challenge, the Heat were no pushovers as LeBron James had to play at an MVP level to win his 4th Finals MVP.\nNext\nRanking The 10 Greatest Teammates That Michael Jordan Has Ever Had In His Career\n2020 NBA Free Agency: Ranking Top 15 Best Players Who Could Be Available\nRanking The 10 Greatest NBA Players Of The 90s\nRanking LeBron James’ 10 Best Teams In The NBA Finals\nLos Angeles Lakers Have 6 Of Top 10 Greatest Players Of All-Time\n\nBy\nEddie Bitar\nEddie Bitar is a senior staff writer at Fadeaway World, renowned for his insightful blend of sports journalism with economic and financial expertise.

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

            "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs. LeBron: Who Faced Tougher Competition in the NBA Finals?\n\nBy Jason McIntyre | Jun 26, 2013\n\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James.\n\nMichael Jordan finished his brilliant NBA career with six championships. LeBron James â only 28 â has won two titles. Nate Silver of the Times had a great breakdown of where they both were at 28, and what LeBronâs chances are of catching Jordanâs six rings. (Spoiler: 30 percent). Also, hereâs a graphic that was making the rounds on the internet over the weekend that you may be interested in:\n\nUndeniable: LeBron has accomplished more at this stage in his NBA career than Jordan has. [Counter: But Jordan went to college!]\n\nI wanted to take a slightly different angle. The 80âs belonged to Magic and Larry. Magicâs last game in his prime was in 1991 (letâs not count that brief run in 1996), and Birdâs was in 1992 at the age of 35. Then, Michael Jordan took over. Many a basketball argument has boiled down to, âhey, Jordan was beating up on a watered-down league compared to the 80s â there were far fewer legendary stars.â [Counter: Huh? The 80s were all Lakers/Celtics with a smattering of Dr. J, Moses and the Pistons.]\n\nI thought itâd be interesting to look back at the teams Jordan beat in his six trips to the Finals against the four teams LeBron has faced in the Finals so far.\n\n1991: Bulls 4, LA Lakers 1 â Lakers won Game 1, Bulls owned rest of the series. Scott & Worthy were hurt and missed Game 5. Scott took just 18 shots in the series.\n1992: Bulls 4, Portland 2 â Probably the weakest team the Bulls beat in Jordanâs six trips to the Finals. Won 57 games. Drexler in his prime.\n1993: Bulls 4, Phoenix 2 â Iâd listen to an argument that all of LeBronâs Finals opponents were better than this Suns team. Won 62 games. Barkley was the NBA MVP.\n\n1996: Bulls 4, Seattle 2 â A good Sonics team, and Kemp had a beastly series, but heâs not Dirk, thatâs for sure. Won 64 games.\n1997: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Might be the best team Jordan beat in the Finals. Karl Malone was the League MVP. Won 64 games.\n1998: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Virtually the exact same core as the year prior. Won 62 games.\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the teams Jordan beat in the Finals: 1) 91 Lakers, 2) 97 Jazz, 3) 98 Jazz, 4) 93 Suns, 5) 96 Sonics, 6) 92 Blazers.\n\nLeBronâs Final opponents? This is probably due to recency bias, but Iâd say theyâve been considerably tougher than the teams Jordan beat:\n\n2007: Spurs 4, Cavaliers 0 â The Spurs went 16-4 in the playoffs. Tim Duncan is a Top 10 player in NBA history and better than any of the players Jordan beat, with the exception of Magic. [Counter: 1991 Magic led the NBA in turnovers, his shooting from the field was in steady decline, he was only 2nd in the NBA in assists, and the Lakers were at the end of their dynasty, finishing 2nd in the West.] Tony Parker was the MVP of this series, and just for fun â¦ in the annals of NBA history, who will wind up thought of as the better player, Tony Parker or Gary Payton? Tony Parker or John Stockton?\n\n2011: Mavericks 4, Heat 2 â Dirk Nowitzki is considered one of the best shooting forwards in NBA history. Barkley or Dirk? Barkley was 29 on his only trip to the Finals, and averaged 27 points and 13 rebounds in that series. He had 32-12-10 in a Game 4 loss, and 42-13 in a Game 2 loss. Dirk or Kemp? Dirk or Mailman? Dirk averaged 26-9 in the 2011 Finals, and made 45 of 46 free throws. Fun discussion where thereâs no right or wrong answer: Was Dirk a more complete player than Barkley, Kemp and Mailman? The Mavs beat Kobe, Durant and LeBron in the postseason.\n\n2012: Heat 4, Thunder 1 â Difficult to say how good this Thunder team was. We may not know for a few years. But at this rate, Durant and Westbrook (assuming they stick together) could end up having Hall of Fame careers and being similar to Stockton/Malone, who went to the Finals twice. Jordan never faced a dominant young scoring tandem such as Durant and Westbrook in the Finals.\n\n2013: Heat 4, Spurs 3: Duncan at 37, Ginobili at 35. And San Antonio benefited from the Westbrook injury (and swept the Lakers minus Kobe). The West was such a mess, the Spurs struggled against the Warriors (4-2), then swept the Grizzlies, who were only there because of the Westbrook injury. Iâd compare these Spurs tot he 1991 Lakers, but that Laker team was injured and not nearly as old. Comparing across decades is impossible and an exercise in futility, but wouldnât this yearâs Spurs team have beaten any of Jordanâs Finals opponents?\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the 10 opponents Jordan and LeBron have faced in the Finals:\n\n1. 2007 Spurs (LeBron)\n2. 1991 Lakers (Jordan)\n3. 2011 Mavericks (LeBron)\n4. 1997 Jazz (Jordan)\n5. 1998 Jazz (Jordan)\n6. 2013 Spurs (LeBron)\n7. 2012 Thunder (LeBron)\n8. 1993 Suns (Jordan)\n9. 1996 Sonics (Jordan)\n10. 1992 Blazers (Jordan)\n\nÂ© 2025 TheBigLead - All Rights Reserved\n\n"

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\n\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\n\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\n\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\n\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something.\n\nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\n\nThe overall picture\n\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\n\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\n\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\n\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\n\nNot so fast...\n\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\n\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\n\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\n\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\n\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\n\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\n\n\n\nIt's not just the first round either.\n\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\n\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\n\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat.\n\nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\n\nTeam | Round | Rating | Who? | Result\n1986 Celtics | 1st Round | 1770 | MJ | Lost\n1989 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1767 | MJ | Lost\n2008 Celtics | Conf Semis | 1700 | LeBron | Lost\n2011 Bulls | Conf Finals | 1698 | LeBron | Won\n1985 Bucks | 1st Round | 1697 | MJ | Lost\n1993 Knicks | Conf Finals | 1696 | MJ | Won\n1990 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1686 | MJ | Lost\n1998 Pacers | Conf Finals | 1680 | MJ | Won\n2009 Magic | Conf Finals | 1680 | LeBron | Lost\n1987 Celtics | 1st Round | 1676 | MJ | Lost\n1996 Magic | Conf Finals | 1671 | MJ | Won\nDid LeBron have it easier prior to reaching the Finals? Yes.\n\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\n\nFinals opponents\n\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\n\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\n\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year.\n\nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition.\n\nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\n\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\n\nTeam | Rating | Opponent\n2017 Warriors | 1850 | LeBron\n2015 Warriors | 1802 | LeBron\n2016 Warriors | 1790 | LeBron\n1998 Jazz | 1762 | MJ\n1997 Jazz | 1751 | MJ\n2012 Thunder | 1737 | LeBron\n2014 Spurs | 1730 | LeBron\n2011 Mavericks | 1717 | LeBron\n2013 Spurs | 1711 | LeBron\n2018 Warriors | 1710 | LeBron\n2007 Spurs | 1705 | LeBron\n1992 Blazers | 1702 | MJ\n1991 Lakers | 1697 | MJ\n1996 Sonics | 1695 | MJ\n1993 Suns | 1634 | MJ\nIt's a team sport!\n\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\n\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\n\nIt's impossible to know.\n\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings.\n\n | Jordan | LeBron\nTeam rating | 1770 | 1687\nOpponent | 1706 | 1750\nDifference | +64 | -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\n\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\n\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\n\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\n\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\n\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\n\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\n\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\n\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nMicah Adams\n\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.

But few have had the impact that LeBron James has had, especially on the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron's arrival in LA in 2018 marked a significant shift in the team's trajectory, and his presence has undeniably shaped the modern era of the Lakers dynasty. In this post, we'll delve into the multifaceted impact of LeBron James on the Lakers, exploring his influence on the court, in the locker room, and within the broader context of the NBA.\n\nGrowing up in the Bay Area, I was always more of a Warriors fan, but the allure of the Lakers—with their star-studded rosters and Hollywood glamour—was impossible to ignore. When LeBron joined the Lakers, it felt like a seismic shift in the NBA landscape. His move to LA wasn't just about basketball; it was about legacy, branding, and the future of the sport.\n\nSo, what exactly has LeBron brought to the Lakers? Let's break it down.\n\nOn-Court Impact: The King's Reign\n\nStatistical Dominance\n\nFirst and foremost, LeBron's on-court impact is undeniable. Since joining the Lakers, he's continued to put up staggering numbers, even as he's aged. His ability to score, facilitate, and defend at an elite level has been a game-changer for the Lakers. In his first season with the team, he averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game—numbers that are simply jaw-dropping for a player in his 16th season.\n\nBut it's not just about the stats. LeBron's presence on the court changes the dynamics of the game. His basketball IQ, court vision, and leadership have elevated the play of those around him. Players like Anthony Davis have thrived under his guidance, and the Lakers have seen a resurgence in their offensive and defensive capabilities.\n\nChampionship Run\n\nOf course, the ultimate measure of success in the NBA is championships, and LeBron delivered in 2020. The Lakers' championship run that year was a testament to LeBron's leadership and the team's cohesion. His performance in the playoffs, particularly in the Finals against the Miami Heat, was nothing short of spectacular. He averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game in the Finals, securing his fourth championship and fourth Finals MVP award.\n\nThat championship was more than just a trophy; it was a statement. It proved that LeBron could still lead a team to the promised land, even in the latter stages of his career. It also reaffirmed the Lakers' status as a premier franchise, capable of attracting top talent and competing at the highest level.\n\nInjuries and Adaptability\n\nHowever, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. LeBron has dealt with his fair share of injuries since joining the Lakers, which has forced the team to adapt. His absence has highlighted the importance of depth and the need for other players to step up. In some ways, these challenges have made the Lakers a more resilient and versatile team.\n\nBut let's be real, the Lakers are a different beast with LeBron on the court. His ability to adapt his game, whether it's playing more in the post or focusing on facilitating, has been crucial. He's a chameleon on the court, always finding ways to contribute, even as his role evolves.\n\nOff-Court Impact: The LeBron Effect\n\nLeadership and Mentorship\n\nLeBron's impact extends far beyond the court. His leadership and mentorship have been instrumental in shaping the Lakers' culture. He's known for his work ethic, professionalism, and dedication to the game. These qualities have rubbed off on his teammates, creating a culture of excellence and accountability.\n\nPlayers like Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball have spoken about the influence LeBron has had on their careers. His guidance has helped them grow as players and professionals. This kind of leadership is invaluable, especially in a league where young players are constantly coming in and needing direction.\n\nBrand and Business\n\nLeBron's arrival in LA also brought a significant boost to the Lakers' brand and business. His star power and global appeal have attracted new fans, sponsors, and media attention. The Lakers have always been a marquee franchise, but with LeBron, they've reached new heights of popularity and relevance.\n\nHis business acumen has also been a boon for the Lakers. LeBron's involvement in various business ventures, from media production to investments, has positioned him as more than just an athlete. He's a brand, an influencer, and a businessman. This multifaceted approach has benefited the Lakers, both on and off the court.\n\nCommunity and Social Impact\n\nBeyond the game, LeBron's impact on the community and his social activism have been profound. His I PROMISE School in Akron, Ohio, is a testament to his commitment to education and community development. In LA, he's continued this work, using his platform to address social issues and inspire change.\n\nHis vocal stance on social justice has resonated with fans and players alike. He's used his voice to advocate for equality, fairness, and progress. This kind of leadership transcends basketball and speaks to the broader impact athletes can have on society.\n\nThe Future of the Lakers Dynasty\n\nSustaining Success\n\nLooking ahead, the big question is: Can the Lakers sustain their success with LeBron at the helm? As he ages, the challenges will only grow. Injuries, fatigue, and the natural decline of athletic abilities are all factors to consider.\n\nBut if there's one thing we've learned about LeBron, it's that he's always up for a challenge. His dedication to his craft, his body, and his mindset has allowed him to defy the odds time and time again. As long as he's in purple and gold, the Lakers will be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBuilding Around LeBron\n\nThe key to sustaining success will be building a strong supporting cast around LeBron. The Lakers have done a decent job of this so far, but there's always room for improvement. Bringing in the right mix of veterans and young talent will be crucial. Players who can complement LeBron's strengths and fill in the gaps when he's not on the court.\n\nThe front office will also play a significant role. Smart drafting, strategic trades, and savvy free agency moves will be essential. The Lakers have a rich history of attracting top talent, and they'll need to continue that tradition to stay competitive.\n\nThe Next Generation\n\nEventually, the torch will need to be passed to the next generation. LeBron can't play forever, and the Lakers will need to prepare for life after The King. This means investing in young talent, developing them, and giving them the tools to succeed.\n\nPlayers like Talen Horton-Tucker and Austin Reaves have shown promise, and the Lakers will need more of that. Building a sustainable pipeline of talent will be key to maintaining the dynasty long after LeBron hangs up his sneakers.\n\nThe Legacy of LeBron James\n\nA Lasting Impact\n\nWhen all is said and done, LeBron's legacy with the Lakers will be one of transformation and excellence. He's not just a player; he's a catalyst for change. His impact on the court, in the locker room, and within the community has been profound.\n\nHe's redefined what it means to be a superstar in the modern NBA. His approach to the game, his business savvy, and his social activism have set a new standard. Future generations of players will look to LeBron as a model of what's possible, both on and off the court.\n\nA Dynasty Redefined\n\nThe Lakers dynasty has always been about more than just winning. It's about style, glamour, and the intersection of sports and entertainment. LeBron's arrival in LA has only amplified this. He's brought a new level of star power and relevance to the franchise, ensuring that the Lakers remain at the forefront of the NBA landscape.\n\nAs a fan and observer, it's been incredible to watch this journey unfold. LeBron's impact on the Lakers has been nothing short of transformative, and his legacy will be felt for generations to come. Is this the best approach? Let's consider...\n\nConclusion: The King's Reign Continues\n\nIn conclusion, LeBron James' impact on the Los Angeles Lakers has been multifaceted and profound. From his on-court dominance to his off-court leadership and influence, he's redefined what it means to be a superstar in the modern NBA. As the Lakers look to the future, sustaining success will be about building around LeBron, investing in young talent, and preparing for the next generation.\n\nThe legacy of LeBron James with the Lakers will be one of transformation and excellence. He's not just a player; he's a catalyst for change. His impact on the court, in the locker room, and within the community has been profound, and his legacy will be felt for generations to come.\n\nSo, as we look ahead, the question remains: Can the Lakers sustain their success with LeBron at the helm? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure—as long as The King is in purple and gold, the Lakers will be a force to be reckoned with. I'm torn between optimism and realism, but ultimately, I believe in the power of LeBron's leadership and the Lakers' rich history. The future is bright, and the dynasty continues.\n\nFAQ\n\nQ: How has LeBron James changed the Lakers' on-court strategy?\nA: LeBron's versatility and basketball IQ have allowed the Lakers to adapt their strategy based on his strengths.

One of the defining tests of NBA superstardom is a player’s ability to positively influence his teammates’ play. Stars can improve a teammate’s play through not only their own play, but also their presence; the greatest players of all-time carry an aura with them that embodies winning.\n\nFour-time NBA champion and Finals MVP LeBron James has illustrated this aura throughout the entirety of his 17-year career. James has the power to thrust his teammates into an unfamiliar position — directly in the spotlight.\n\nIf these players deliver when they are called upon, their legacies are cemented next to role players like Steve Kerr, whose famous 1997 Finals-winning shot lives on eternally in the Role Player Hall of Fame. Failure to deliver, however, means a player will be exposed to a level of scrutiny unlike ever before. This phenomenon experienced by James’ teammates can be known as the “LeBron Effect.”\n\nJames’ impact on his teammates is so profound that his influence was felt not just by younger players, but also by accomplished veterans like Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo over last season.\n\nHere is a look at how James impacted the play of his teammates last season.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoward, Rondo experience veteran resurgence\n\nBefore their tenures with the Lakers, it seemed both Howard and Rondo were more destined for stardom in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league than a return to their NBA glory. And while a lack of talent was hardly the issue for either of the former All-NBA selections, accountability was.\n\nAfter stops in five different cities over the past five seasons, Dwight Howard arrived in Los Angeles on a last-chance deal. Playing alongside James sparked a newfound commitment to winning in Howard. For the first time in his career, he embraced his ideal role as a rim-protecting screen setter.\n\nEven when Howard was scoring over 20 points a night, he was never a great low post scorer, as most of his offense depended on his otherworldly athleticism. Despite this, Howard adamantly maintained his status among the league leaders in post-ups year after year. During the 2017-18 season (Howard’s last full season before this year), he ranked third in the NBA with 331 field goal attempts off post-ups. Low post scoring requires a soft-touch and grace that has eluded Howard his entire career.\n\nJames and the Lakers unlocked the optimal version of Howard. Instead of stagnating their offense by throwing the ball into a stationary Howard on the low block, Los Angeles leveraged his athleticism and screen-setting ability. In 69 games this season, Howard only attempted 23 shots out of post-ups.\n\nWhile Howard deserves credit for making the long-overdue adjustments to his game, it’s impossible to imagine him embracing a limited role off the bench that didn’t come at the James’ behest.\n\nFor as good as Howard was, Rondo’s resurgence was far more vital to the Lakers’ championship run. James’ greatest impact on Rondo came in the form of trust.\n\nOne of the hardest parts for any great NBA player is determining what responsibilities they can delegate over the course of 48 minutes. For a player with James’ playmaking prowess, conceding touches in the postseason and allowing a teammate to initiate the offense can be risky. But having an unflappable veteran point guard capable of taking the reins of the offense goes a long way in easing that feeling.\n\nRondo averaged 6.6 assists per game in the playoffs and served as the guiding hand for the Lakers’ bench units. In Los Angeles’ Game 4 win in the NBA Finals, Rondo orchestrated the pick and roll that ultimately set up Anthony Davis for the game-sealing three with under a minute remaining. Rondo is unafraid of any moment, and following the Lakers’ defeat in Game 5, he took the onus upon himself to put the Miami Heat away in Game 6.\n\n\n\nRajon Rondo has another ring on his mind.\n\nHe’s 5-5 from the field.\n\n(: @Lakers) pic.twitter.com/YckyMYzAAt\n\n— theScore (@theScore) October 12, 2020\n\n\n\nRondo began the game shooting 5-for-5 as part of a 19-point effort in the series’ closeout game. Aggressive drives in semi-transition opportunities like the one above depict how he sliced through Miami’s defense. As the postseason continued, Rondo looked more comfortable in not only attacking the basket, but also shooting.\n\nFor the playoffs, Rondo shot 40 percent (20-of-50) from three, a vast improvement for the career 31.6 percent long-range shooter. Although it seems highly unlikely that Rondo’s success from deep will translate over the course of an entire season, the threat of a jump shot alone made Rondo far more dangerous in the pick and roll. Even in the games that he did not shoot well, Rondo remained engaged and did the little things crucial for winning.\n\n\n\nEstablishing a name\n\nWhile James helped redefine the narratives surrounding some of the Lakers veterans’ careers, he also helped shape those of the younger Lakers. Alex Caruso went from a beloved meme on NBA Twitter to an invaluable piece capable of locking down opposing perimeter players and hitting timely shots.\n\nIn the 560 regular minutes that James and Caruso shared the floor, Los Angeles outscored their opponents by a staggering 18.6 points per 100 possessions. It did not matter who else occupied the other three spots on the floor, as James and Caruso’s presence in a lineup alone ensured the Lakers’ success.\n\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. While no one has perfected the chase down quite like James, Caruso’s rejection of James Harden on the play below was a visual embodiment of the effort Caruso plays with nightly. Unparalleled energy and passion paired with James’ unwavering confidence in him turned Caruso into a necessary ingredient in the Lakers championship recipe.\n\n\n\nCARUSO CHASEDOWN BLOCK ON HARDEN.\n\n(via @NBATV)pic.twitter.com/Hp0ZQemjZl\n\n— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 13, 2020\n\n\n\nNo Lakers player felt the negative aspects of the LeBron Effect more than Danny Green. In Game 5, James presented Green with his Steve Kerr opportunity, but history had other plans.\n\nOne missed shot does not define a legacy, but one made shot can. Even though the Lakers still went on to win the series and Green is now a three-time NBA champion, he will likely never get a chance at basketball immortality again. But even for as painful as the miss was, Markieff Morris’ turnover on the play was far more egregious, as James was standing wide open on the wing when Morris heaved the lob pass out of bounds.\n\nWhile James’ latest Finals victory has breathed new life into the G.O.A.T debate, do not expect his approach to falter. As the King continues chasing the legacy of a ghost in Chicago, he must continue to expect the same greatness he requires of himself from his teammates.\n\ni want more great stories!\n\nSign up today for free and get the best sports content sent to your inbox.\n\nYou can unsubscribe anytime.

[+] Barnes on October 31. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\nLeBron James is arguably the most dominant athlete of his generation and has chosen to close out his career playing for the Los Angeles Lakers. It is very early to judge his impact on the Lakers, as they have started at 2-5, but ultimately he will have a dynamic effect on the team, the city and the fan base.\n\nThis may not have as immediate as folks in Los Angeles may like; however, we will inevitably see this \"LeBron Effect\" bless his new team and market in time.\n\n1. Television Ratings — NBA pre-season games have negligible viewership yet a Laker pre-season game drew a 0.7 household rating and 1.17 million viewers per sportsmediawatch.com. The Laker opening game against Houston delivered an impressive 2.0 household rating with 3.36 million viewers on ESPN. That was the largest regular-season NBA draw on ESPN since a 2016 Lakers-Warrior game which was the last game of Kobe Bryant's career and featured the Warriors record-breaking 73rd win. This is only a small preview of the draw that LeBron could garner over the\n\n2. Merchandise — When LeBron's Laker signing was announced, it created a frenzy of jersey sales. Per Fox Business, Fanatics, one of the world's largest sports merchandise retailers, announced that the 24 hours following the announcement resulted in that day breaking sales records and was one of their top 10 sales days. In addition to the apparel, Nike, right on cue, released their sixteenth iteration of LeBron's signature shoe. Nike has released this model in four different colorways so far, including a female-exclusive version made by women for women, which sold out in seconds. Nike also released a Staples Center version in classic Laker purple for the home opener which sold out. LeBron has always been popular and certain colors of specific models in his signature line have been popular, but not to this level. It is clear that his newfound home and enormous star-profile have had mutually beneficial effects, and the hype behind his shoes indicates his athlete approval rating is as high as it has ever been.\n\n3. On-Court Impact on The Team — Even though the Lakers are 2-5 to begin the season, three of the five losses were against legitimate title contenders and the point differential was only five. Last year Brandon Ingram played the small forward position and average 16.1 points, five rebounds and 3.9 assists. LeBron has posted stats of 27.1 points,  9.0 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game which clearly higher than Ingram's numbers for last year. Ingram has been moved to power forward with the addition of LeBron and the trading of Julius Randle, and has better stats this year than last so the adjustment is looking to be beneficial in that respect, already. JaVale McGee, the Lakers' newly acquired Center, is also posting career numbers, which looks to be a direct correlation to the improved ball movement that LeBron's addition brings to the team. He is such a powerful influence on other players, that once they adjust to his presence, the future for the purple and gold is bright.\n\n4. Impact on Other Franchises and Coaches — Historically, every team LeBron has played for has flourished with his presence and has seen a downturn when he leaves. Under Coach Tyron Lue, he led the team to a combined record of 128-77, a win percentage of. Without him, the Cavs lost their first six games and Coach Lue was fired. In his first tenure with the Cavs under Coach Mike Brown, the teams win percentage was 66.3%. LeBron then left for Miami and Coach Brown was fired. At Miami, LeBron posted a 71% win percentage. Since his departure Coach, Erik Spoelstra has a significantly lower winning percentage of 52%. Luke Walton's future is in the hands of the success of the Lakers over the next few years, but Walton and James will eventually catch their stride and get used to one another. Once that happens, it is inevitable that the Lakers will flourish.\n\nLook for the \"LeBron James Effect\" over the course of this season and future seasons, as the Lakers' television ratings, merchandising, and fan base to rise and grow.\n\n"
