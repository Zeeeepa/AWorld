With 4 regular-season MVPs, 3 Finals MVPs, and 3 championships in his career so far, he's already one of the greatest ever to play the sport of basketball.\n\nKyrie says playing with KD is the first time he's been able to defer late in games 👀 (via @boardroom | @boardroompods) pic.twitter.com/qkJG5L9o2y\n\nDespite his illustrious career, King James is sometimes criticized for his performance during clutch moments. Recently, Kyrie Irving, LeBron James' former teammate, took a dig at James and inferred that he (Irving) has never had any teammates in the past who could hit big shots down the stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 5 clutch moments of LeBron James' career:\n\nIn this article, we'll take a look at 5 of the most clutch playoff moments of LeBron James' career.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\n#5. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014. The Chicago Bulls posed a serious threat to the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\n#TBT to when LeBron James hit a game-winning buzzer-beater over Jimmy Butler and the Bulls in the 2015 Eastern Conference Semis. pic.twitter.com/VurMVnw3oz\n\nIn Game 4, with the scores tied at 84-84 and with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, LeBron James hit a deep 2 from the corner over Jimmy Butler to help Cleveland level the series. The Cavs went on to win the series 4-2 and reached the NBA Finals that year.\n\n#4. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals. The Cleveland Cavaliers lost the Game 1 against the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOn this date in 2009, LeBron James hit his 1st playoff buzzer-beater to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a 96-95 win over the Orlando Magic in Game 2 of the '09 Eastern Conf. Finals.Orlando, however, would go on to win the series in 6 games. pic.twitter.com/tOZJzfFLPN\n\nDown 2 points in Game 2 with just 1 second left, the Cavaliers were at the risk of going down 0-2 in the series. LeBron James collected an inbound pass a few feet outside the 3-point line and nailed a high-arcing shot to beat the buzzer.\n\nThough Magic went on to win the series in 6, this buzzer-beater from James remains one of the most memorable moments of his storied career.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: The dream starting 5 for the Portland Trail Blazers going into the 2020-21 season\n\n#3. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers, First Round, Game 5, 2018\n\nIn 2018, Victor Oladipo and the Indiana Pacers came closer than ever to upsetting the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2-2, Oladipo had the ball in his hand with the scores tied at 95.\n\n.@KingJames WINS IT AT THE BUZZER! 🚨😱Pacers vs. Cavaliers, 2018 Eastern Conference 1st Round Game 5 - 2pm ET on NBA TV! pic.twitter.com/88wPXvteqp\n\nWhat happened next remains as one of the best sequence of plays ever on both ends of the court. LeBron James blocked a layup attempt with 3 seconds left on the clock and drilled a deep 3 to beat the buzzer on the other side. The Cavaliers went on to win the series in 7 games.\n\n#2. Miami Heat vs San Antonio Spurs, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2013\n\nThe Miami Heat were one game away from winning back-to-back NBA championships in 2013. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, there was nothing to split the teams up until 3 quarters.\n\n7 years ago today, LeBron did this to the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 NBA Finals! 37 PTS5-10 3PT12 REB4 AST2 STLBack-to-back champs! pic.twitter.com/ccoz02gUll\n\nLeBron James took over in the final quarter as he went on to score 16 points in the final 12 minutes. He went 7-11 in the quarter, and also hit a clutch jumper to extend Miami's lead to 4 points with just 28 seconds left on the clock.\n\n#1. Cleveland Cavaliers vs Golden State Warriors, NBA Finals, Game 7, 2016\n\nCleveland Cavaliers pulled off the impossible in 2016 against the mighty Golden State Warriors. After being down 3-1 in the NBA Finals, the Cavs came back all guns blazing and won the next 3 games to win their first title in franchise history.\n\nLeBron’s block, Kyrie’s dagger, Cleveland’s title. 🏆Game 7 of the 2016 Finals was epic. (🎥: @NBATV) pic.twitter.com/G9owcuKPss\n\nThe scores were tied in Game 7 with less than 2 minutes left on the clock. The Warriors' Andre Iguodala was about the give them the lead in what seemed like an easy layup at the rim.\n\nThis is when LeBron James made an incredible run from the other side of the court, and leaped as high as anyone could to block the shot off the backboard. To this day, this remains arguably the best block in NBA history.\n\nAmith Sreedhar\n\nAmith is an avid basketball and tennis fan who has been actively associated with Sportskeeda during the 2020 NBA season.\n\nApart from writing about sports, Amith has attended numerous tennis tournaments and NBA games in the United States and hopes to do it more often in the future.\n\nWhen not watching decade-old Roger Federer highlights on Youtube, Amith loves traveling and hiking in the mountains\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

The results would be a little different, even if nearly a quarter of the anonymous, 26-player poll thought that LeBron would go down as the greatest player of all time.\n\nLeBron's battle against the clutch has been the subject of much discussion over the past few years—Dan Favale has a great piece on his evolution here at B/R—but there's no more room for debate. He thrives when the going gets tough.\n\nDeciding Shots with the Shot Clock Turned Off\n\nBefore expanding the definition of \"clutch\" to include more types of plays, let's first take a look at what happens on shots to either tie or take the lead during the final 24 seconds of either the fourth quarter or an overtime period.\n\nIs there any moment more crucial? The ball is in a player's hands, and he has the opportunity to either ensure victory or defeat. According to Miami Heat beat writer Tim Reynolds, LeBron was pretty darn good in those situations.\n\nNot only did he make the most shots—far more than a certain member of the Los Angeles Lakers—but he also shot 41.2 percent from the field. You have to re-contextualize here, as defensive intensity ramps up in these situations. A lower field-goal percentage is to be expected when the game is on the line, and it should be rather telling that only Kevin Durant's mark beat LeBron's.\n\nBut these players aren't the only ones who can take game-deciding shots. They can also pass the ball to teammates and have them do the dirty work. It's a concept that not too many superstars are familiar with, as \"hero ball\" has unfortunately taken over as the method du jour when the contest is on the line.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of a game in which the player's team was tied or behind by three points or fewer, no one in the NBA recorded more assists than LeBron. He, Nicolas Batum and Andre Miller each produced four assists, and LeBron did so while keeping his sheet free from any of those pesky little turnovers.\n\nPaul Pierce was the only other player from Reynolds' tweet to avoid a goose egg in the assist column, and he checked in with two dimes.\n\nThe league MVP is already at the forefront of the discussion when isolating scoring, but he pulls ahead by an even wider margin as soon as his elite passing is brought into the conversation. During the 2012-13 season, you wanted the ball in his hands when the game was truly on the line.\n\nBut now let's expand the definition of clutch to be much more inclusive, thus raising the sample size enough to draw more conclusions.\n\nRaises Performance During the Final Minutes of Close Games\n\nI wrote a recent article about why it's so important Dwyane Wade fully cedes the alpha-dog role to his talented teammate, but it's worth bringing up again.\n\nFor the purposes of this section, there are going to be two different definitions of clutch. \"Clutch 1\" will be considered the last five minutes of a game when teams are separated by five points or fewer, and \"Clutch 2\" will be the last 30 seconds of a one-possession game, regardless of which team was ahead at the time.\n\nIf you look at per-36-minute numbers, LeBron has consistently raised his game as the going gets tougher:\n\nAssuming that you could extrapolate his Clutch 2 numbers to a full 36 minutes of action (an admittedly faulty assumption since things change in a one-possession game), LeBron would put up a triple-double while scoring over 60 points. That's pure insanity.\n\nLebron James' per-36-minute numbers are impressive enough over the course of a contest. But when we enter into Clutch 1 and Clutch 2 situations, he just goes berserk. He scores with reckless abandon—especially when he decides to start attacking the rim—gets everyone involved, and crashes the boards with a fury.\n\nNo one else does that to the same extent. And the trend carries over to the postseason as well. In Clutch 1 situations, LeBron averaged 26.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 11.5 assists per 36 minutes while shooting 44 percent from the field. All of the counting stats are higher than his normal playoff numbers, and the field-goal percentage was only slightly lower.\n\nHowever, in Clutch 2 situations during last year's postseason, he completely changed his style of play. He met the criteria in six games, and while he didn't record a single rebound or assist, he did manage to average 55.2 points per 36 minutes on 60 percent shooting from the field.\n\nThere was just no decline.\n\nTriple-Double and Game-Winner in the Postseason\n\nAnd speaking of the postseason, how about the fact that LeBron is the only player to record both a triple-double and hit a game-winner in the same playoff game, as he did against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe truly made history when he beat Paul George to the hoop for a relatively easy left-handed layup last Eastern Conference Finals, cementing his legacy as a player who could come up big when the moments got tougher.\n\nNow for the rest of this article, I'm going to be changing the definition of \"clutch\" once more. Throughout each of the next three sections, it will be defined as the last five minutes of a game when the contest is separated by less than five points, and only players who met those criteria in at least 10 games (while playing two or more minutes per contest) during 2012-13 will be included.\n\nIt's a rather broad definition, but, again, it's a necessary one so that we can have at least a fairly substantial sample size.\n\nAcross-the-Board Greatness\n\nOne of the things that makes LeBron so special is his impact in all major categories during the closing minutes of a game. In fact, no player has as big of an across-the-board impact.\n\nObviously, it's hard to play a lot of minutes in this type of clutch situation because, by definition, it's just five minutes in any game unless there's an overtime or two. So keep that in mind when you see numbers that are far lower than you might expect.\n\nLeBron didn't score the most points per game in this type of clutch situation, but he wasn't far off the mark.\n\nThat wasn't the only area in which he excelled, even if Chris Paul and Kyrie Irving were the only ones in the above graph with higher field-goal percentages. LeBron also crashed the boards quite often during the closing minutes of tight games.\n\nThink we're done yet? Think again. Assists matter too!\n\nLeBron and Rajon Rondo were in a league of their own when it came to passing the ball during the closing stretch of a tight game. They were both willing and able to find openings in the suffocating defenses thrown at them, and the rest of the league just wasn't even close.\n\nNow, how many of the 15 names are repeats? The answer is rather simple: only one.\n\nLeBron appears on all three graphs, and no other player in the NBA finds himself on more than a single top-five leaderboard. He's an elite scorer, rebounder and distributor when the pressure cooker is turned up to its highest notch.\n\nLiterally, no one else can say that. And did this change in the postseason? Of course not!\n\nOnce the playoffs rolled around, the Heat star finished No. 1 in clutch scoring, No. 4 in rebounding (behind Chandler Parsons, Joakim Noah and Boris Diaw), and No. 7 in assists (trailing Kirk Hinrich, Russell Westbrook, Josh Smith, Manu Ginobili, Mike Conley and Luol Deng).\n\nStill pretty darn elite.\n\nPIE vs. Winning Percentage\n\nPlayer impact estimate (PIE) hasn't entered the collective consciousness of NBA fans yet, but it's a wonderful tool used by NBA.com to show how involved a player is. Instead of usage rate, which omits assists, rebounds and anything that doesn't finish a play, PIE \"measures a player's overall statistical contribution against the total statistics in games they play in.\"\n\nDuring clutch situations, no player had a higher PIE than LeBron's 29.7. He was just ultra-involved in the contest at all times, more so than Kobe Bryant (26.5), Kevin Durant (24.3), James Harden (23.3) and everyone else.\n\nBut, that's only good if it results in success. Being highly involved can be a bad thing if wins aren't the result.\n\nFor that reason, I've put together this graph, which correlates PIE (X-axis) with winning percentage (Y-axis) for the 20 most \"involved\" players in the NBA:\n\nThat's a pretty telling image, as LeBron both had the highest winning percentage and the most involvement. He's the dot in the top right, and he's joined at 80 percent on the Y-axis by his teammate, Chris Bosh.\n\nNo one else is close in either category. But now, let's break it down even further and look at his involvement in the Heat's scoring plays.\n\nInvolvement in Scoring Plays\n\nTwo new stats are relevant here: percent assisted and percent field goals made.\n\nThe former represents the number of made shots by teammates that were assisted by the player in question when he was on the court, and the latter shows the percentage of made field goals credited to the player when he was playing.\n\nAt this point, it shouldn't surprise you to learn that LeBron James was elite in both categories during crunch time among those who played at least 20 games that met the parameters.\n\nIn fact, he finished fifth in percent assisted, behind only Ricky Rubio, Rajon Rondo, Will Bynum and Raymond Felton. As for percent field goals made, he was significantly lower, but still doing pretty well for himself with at 15th.\n\nBut let's take this a step beyond and combine the two to show overall involvement in scoring plays, something that I'm just going to call percent scoring. It's calculated rather easily, just by adding percent assisted to percent field goals made.\n\nAs you might expect, LeBron is right near the top of the leaderboard:\n\nLeBron and Kobe should stand out to you. The rest are all point guards—yes, that's Will Bynum benefiting from a small sample size, not Andrew Bynum—which makes sense, because floor generals are naturally more involved in the playmaking.\n\nThere's also a major benefit gained from being a superstar on a lackluster team. That's giving Kyrie Irving and Jrue Holiday an artificial boost, as there simply weren't other intriguing options on the Cleveland Cavaliers and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively.\n\nFor those reasons, you should be most impressed by LeBron, Kobe and CP3, considering their teammates.\n\nAnd across the board, you should just be in awe of how great LeBron is with the game on the line. Although there's already a large gap between him and the rest of the league no matter how much time is left on the clock, there's an even larger disparity when nearing the final buzzer in a tight game.\n\nHis scoring prowess, willingness to make the right play, and consistent ability to come out on top make him stand out in a big way.\n\nGo ahead—keep denying LeBron's ability to come up big when it counts. The rest of us will be over here trying to contain our laughter.\n\nNote: All stats, unless otherwise indicated, come from NBA.com's statistical databases, and all graphics were created with Infogr.am.\n\n"
