One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times.

He lost one series as the favorite (2011 vs. Dallas) but led his teams to a pair of series wins as the oddsmakers’ underdog (2012 vs. Oklahoma City and 2016 vs. Golden State, when Cleveland memorably erased a 3-1 deficit to beat the 73-9 record-setting Warriors).\n\nJames … Category … Jordan\n\n4 … NBA championships … 6\n\n4-6 … NBA Finals record … 6-0\n\n4 … Finals MVPs … 6\n\n4 … Regular-season MVPs … 5\n\n18 … All-NBA teams … 11\n\n6 … All-Defense teams … 9\n\n0 … Defensive POY … 1\n\n19 … All-Star teams … 14\n\n1 … Scoring titles … 10\n\n3 (1 bronze) … Olympic medals … 2\n\nRelated Articles\n\nShare this:\n\nMost Popular\n\nDisneyland pauses all Magic Key sales again — this time with a twist\n\n5 high school or younger students among those in deadly Santa Ana crash\n\nIn Santa Ana crash that killed 4, 5th on life support\n\nOwner of beachfront oil, natural gas property in Huntington Beach proposes 800-unit housing development\n\nRock and Brews closes Tustin location after five years\n\nOC Parks Summer Concert Series returns with free live music in 2025\n\nWant a CD paying 6% or more?

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

One endless debate.From the day LeBron James first picked up a basketball, he wanted to be like Mike. James and his closest friends idolized Michael Jordan while they grew up together in Akron, Ohio. As James grew into a tantalizing basketball prospect capable of jumping from high school to the NBA as the No. 1 draft pick, he studied, imitated and drew profound inspiration from Jordan’s tongue-wagging dunks, that fadeaway jumper, his competitive fire – even the little details of the way Jordan wore his sneakers and shorts.“M.J. was an inspiration,” James told reporters on March 7, 2019, the night he passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA’s career scoring list. “M.J. was the lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.”Now 38 and just a game or two from passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the top spot on that same list, James is one of the few players who can legitimately be discussed alongside Jordan when it comes to laying claim to the title of G.O.A.T. (“Greatest of All Time”).No one here is picking sides (and James’ career legacy is still being written), but here is a closer look at how the two superstars stack up today when it comes to the regular season, the postseason and their respective achievements and honors (all stats are through Feb. 5, 2023):Michael Jordan’s career scoring average (30.12 ppg) is the highest in NBA history, and he won the season scoring title 10 times.

Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\nSettled. Right?\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\nJordan vs. James: Career points\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.
