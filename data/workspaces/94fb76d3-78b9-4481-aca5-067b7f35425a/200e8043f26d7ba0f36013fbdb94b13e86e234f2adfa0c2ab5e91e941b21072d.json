LeBron James is clearly still the best player in the world, and the only thing he has yet to prove is to exceed the Michael Jordan comparison. While LeBron James is a completely different player to MJ and plays a different position, the debate will always be there as Jordan is considered the greatest player of all time and the standard for all great players.\nOne topic of comparison is always the competition both legends faced and the road they took to winning NBA championships. Jordan has 6 rings compared to LeBron's 4, but LeBron might have had the tougher competition when narrowing down each Finals' appearance. However, Jordan might have faced the best all-around players in his 6 Finals appearances whereas LeBron played better teams. Nonetheless, it is time to capture each player's NBA Finals appearances by assessing the competition.\nMichael Jordan\n\n1991 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Magic Johnson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Vlade Divac (Hall of Famer), James Worthy (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team)\nMJ's first NBA Finals appearance was a positive one, as was the case for all of MJ's NBA rings. Jordan and the Bulls led the charge against legendary point guard Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. In a showdown between the 2 best players in the era, this was an amazing series whereby Jordan stamped his mark on the league. MJ and the Bulls fell in Game 1, before closing out the series in 5. MJ was the key player all series long, with Scottie Pippen adding in a sensational 32-point game in Game 5 to help MJ close it out. The Lakers finished 3rd in the league that season compared to the Bulls finishing first, and the Jordan era officially began in the 1991 Finals.\n1992 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Clyde Drexler (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Buck Williams (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis is known as the series where Michael Jordan took things personally. Clyde Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1st seed in the Western Conference against the 1st seeded Chicago Bulls. Drexler was thought to be at least equal competition to Michael Jordan, which MJ wanted to prove wrong. Drexler held his own with sensational performances in the series, but MJ had too many key moments such as hitting 6 threes in the 1st quarter of Game 1 and then dropping 33 points in a closeout Game 6. Jordan would simply not allow the series to go to 7, as he was ruthless in making it clear Drexler doesn't come close to his greatness.\n1993 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Charles Barkley (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Dan Majerle (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis was probably the toughest opponent for Michael Jordan. Led by league MVP Charles Barkley, the Suns had the best record in the West while Chicago fell to the #2 seed. As great as Barkley and defensive specialist Dan Majerle were, Jordan and the Bulls were just better. The Bulls took the first 2 games of the series before Phoenix won in 3-OT in Game 3. Jordan responded with 55 points in Game 4 before he made the iconic pass to John Paxson for the game-winning three. Barkley was a dominant player in the series but Jordan was near perfection all series long and he once again did not allow for a Game 7.\n1996 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Gary Payton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Shawn Kemp (All-NBA 2nd Team)\nAfter a brief retirement, Michael Jordan returned to the NBA to continue the MJ-era. Jordan wasn't going away anytime soon, and he led the charge against defensive phenom Gary Payton and athletic glass cleaner Shawn Kemp. MJ and the Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season, as they went to battle with the number one seed in the West. The Bulls were up 3-0 in the series before Payton and Kemp fought back to win 2 straight. Jordan struggled from the floor in Game 6 shooting 5-19, but he had enough help from Pippen and Rodman to close out the series and win Finals MVP in yet another Game 6 closeout.\n1997 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team, All-NBA 2nd Defensive Team)\nMJ and the Bulls made their 5th straight NBA Finals appearance against Karl Malone and John Stockton, who led the Jazz to the best record in the Western Conference. The Bulls won the first 2 games before Utah evened it up in 4. In the legendary \"Flu Game\", Jordan dropped 38 points and willed Chicago to victory in one of the most iconic moments. Jordan then had another iconic moment when he found Steve Kerr for the game-winning shot to capture his 5th title and 5th Finals MVP. Stockton and Malone were a great duo and this presented a massive challenge to MJ and the Bulls, so Jordan's unselfishness in Game 6 was one of his greatest moments.\n1998 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer)\nWas there ever any doubt that Jordan would reach the Finals again? He already had one 3-peat with the Bulls and wanted to do it again. The #1 seeded Bulls led the charge against the #1 seeded Utah Jazz led by Hall of Fame duo Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone and Stockton had taken Game 1 before Chicago answered with 3 straight victories. After Utah stole Game 5, Jordan had one of the most iconic moments in history by stripping Karl Malone on one end and hit the game-winning shot over Bryon Russell to capture his 6th NBA title and 6th Finals MVP.\nLeBron James\n\n2007 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Bruce Bowen (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron's first Finals appearance did not go as he planned, mainly because he was outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Spurs were simply a better team than the Cavaliers as they had 3 Hall of Famers playing under a Hall of Fame coach. Bruce Bowen also made an All-NBA Defensive Team which made life particularly difficult for LeBron in this series. This was a tough series for LeBron as the Cavs were swept, and LeBron does get a pass for most people on this one.\n2011 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Dirk Nowitzki (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Jason Kidd (Hall of Famer), Tyson Chandler (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron's 2nd Finals' appearance also did not go as planned. He had a Superteam with the Miami Heat with the likes of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh by his side, and they were the heavy favorites coming into the series. In possibly the most shocking way, LeBron played much below his usual level and the Heat were beaten in 6 games by the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki was the best player during the playoffs and LeBron James was nowhere near as great. This is a big black mark on LeBron's legendary career for sure.\n2012 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Russell Westbrook (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), James Harden (Hall of Famer), Serge Ibaka (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron James made amends for his prior Finals appearance disaster by leading the Heat Superteam against the Oklahoma City Thunder who had their own younger Superteam. Led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder had athleticism and youth on their side along with an exceptional 6th man in James Harden and an All-NBA Defensive Team player in Serge Ibaka. The Heat were simply too good with their Big Three, and LeBron James finally played like the best player in the series to win his first NBA title.\n2013 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer)\nLeBron's 2nd NBA title came against the San Antonio Spurs, who should have beaten LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Known as the series where Ray Allen made the most clutch shot in NBA history, the Heat fought back and won the series despite being down 3-2. LeBron James was once again the best player in the series, and he willed his team to victory in this series against 4 Hall of Fame Spurs players. Head coach Gregg Popovich forced LeBron to beat them with jumpers, and he did that on his way to winning his 2nd straight Finals MVP.\n2014 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer, All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron James once again was in the Finals with the Miami Heat for the 4th time in a row, this time falling short to the Spurs who exacted their revenge. The Spurs were on a mission this season and the growth of Kawhi Leonard into a star helped San Antonio blow out the Heat in the series. Leonard won Finals MVP, and LeBron could not do enough to counter the Spurs' new Big Four. Dwyane Wade looked older in this series and LeBron James had to settle for another Finals loss in his record.\n2015 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Andrew Bogut (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nOnce again, LeBron James made the Finals this time with his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers. With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love by his side, LeBron James made the Cavs the favorite in the Eastern Conference. Making it all the way to the Finals, they are up against Stephen Curry and the revolutionary Warriors team who introduced the small-ball lineup with Andre Iguodala playing the power forward spot. Unfortunately for LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injures leaving him to fend off the Big Three Warriors by himself. He had a sensational series, but the Warriors had too much with Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP over LeBron James and sending him home with a loss.\n2016 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nThe greatest achievement in LeBron's career came in the 2016 NBA Finals, whereby he played the Warriors against this time with a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Cavs were down 3-1 in the series, and it looked like LeBron would have to suffer yet another loss in the Finals. But he took his game to another level, and alongside Kyrie Irving, were too dominant for the Warriors as they won the NBA title in a historic comeback. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the series, although Kyrie Irving hit the biggest shot of the game in Game 7 to win the series.\n2017 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs once again made the NBA Finals to play the Warriors, except Golden State added superstar player Kevin Durant to join their Big Three of Curry, Thompson, and Green. LeBron still had Irving and Love, but the Warriors were just unstoppable with Kevin Durant as they beat down the Cavs convincingly. LeBron held his own and would have been Finals MVP in the victory, but Durant and the Warriors were too dominant on both ends as KD won Finals MVP and added the 5th Finals loss to LeBron's record.\n2018 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs made the NBA Finals yet again, this time without Kyrie Irving who was traded to Boston. It is a shame LeBron did not have his little brother Irving by his side because their duo was truly exciting to watch. Without Irving, LeBron had to lead average players to battle against the Golden State Warriors juggernaut led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. In one of the most embarrassing Finals moments in history, J.R. Smith dribbled out the clock instead of helping the Cavs snatch Game 1. LeBron put forth a Goliath 50-point performance that went to waste, effectively ending the series the Cavs lost 4-0.\n2020 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Jimmy Butler (All-NBA 3rd Team), Bam Adebayo (All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nWith LeBron's 3rd NBA team, he won his 4th NBA title. While certainly not the toughest opponent that LeBron faced and the easiest challenge in both MJ's and LeBron's competition, James and the Lakers beat the Heat in 6 games. LeBron James had Anthony Davis by his side, while Jimmy Butler was left to fend for himself as both Bam Adebayo and starting point guard Goran Dragic were out with injuries. Butler held his own with iconic performances, but LeBron and Davis were the best duo in the NBA and the Lakers were too good for any team in the league. While LeBron's easiest challenge, the Heat were no pushovers as LeBron James had to play at an MVP level to win his 4th Finals MVP.\nNext\nRanking The 10 Greatest Teammates That Michael Jordan Has Ever Had In His Career\n2020 NBA Free Agency: Ranking Top 15 Best Players Who Could Be Available\nRanking The 10 Greatest NBA Players Of The 90s\nRanking LeBron James’ 10 Best Teams In The NBA Finals\nLos Angeles Lakers Have 6 Of Top 10 Greatest Players Of All-Time\n\nBy\nEddie Bitar\nEddie Bitar is a senior staff writer at Fadeaway World, renowned for his insightful blend of sports journalism with economic and financial expertise.

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.

        "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs. LeBron: Who Faced Tougher Competition in the NBA Finals?\n\nBy Jason McIntyre | Jun 26, 2013\n\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James.\n\nMichael Jordan finished his brilliant NBA career with six championships. LeBron James â only 28 â has won two titles. Nate Silver of the Times had a great breakdown of where they both were at 28, and what LeBronâs chances are of catching Jordanâs six rings. (Spoiler: 30 percent). Also, hereâs a graphic that was making the rounds on the internet over the weekend that you may be interested in:\n\nUndeniable: LeBron has accomplished more at this stage in his NBA career than Jordan has. [Counter: But Jordan went to college!]\n\nI wanted to take a slightly different angle. The 80âs belonged to Magic and Larry. Magicâs last game in his prime was in 1991 (letâs not count that brief run in 1996), and Birdâs was in 1992 at the age of 35. Then, Michael Jordan took over. Many a basketball argument has boiled down to, âhey, Jordan was beating up on a watered-down league compared to the 80s â there were far fewer legendary stars.â [Counter: Huh? The 80s were all Lakers/Celtics with a smattering of Dr. J, Moses and the Pistons.]\n\nI thought itâd be interesting to look back at the teams Jordan beat in his six trips to the Finals against the four teams LeBron has faced in the Finals so far.\n\n1991: Bulls 4, LA Lakers 1 â Lakers won Game 1, Bulls owned rest of the series. Scott & Worthy were hurt and missed Game 5. Scott took just 18 shots in the series.\n1992: Bulls 4, Portland 2 â Probably the weakest team the Bulls beat in Jordanâs six trips to the Finals. Won 57 games. Drexler in his prime.\n1993: Bulls 4, Phoenix 2 â Iâd listen to an argument that all of LeBronâs Finals opponents were better than this Suns team. Won 62 games. Barkley was the NBA MVP.\n\n1996: Bulls 4, Seattle 2 â A good Sonics team, and Kemp had a beastly series, but heâs not Dirk, thatâs for sure. Won 64 games.\n1997: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Might be the best team Jordan beat in the Finals. Karl Malone was the League MVP. Won 64 games.\n1998: Bulls 4, Utah 2 â Virtually the exact same core as the year prior. Won 62 games.\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the teams Jordan beat in the Finals: 1) 91 Lakers, 2) 97 Jazz, 3) 98 Jazz, 4) 93 Suns, 5) 96 Sonics, 6) 92 Blazers.\n\nLeBronâs Final opponents? This is probably due to recency bias, but Iâd say theyâve been considerably tougher than the teams Jordan beat:\n\n2007: Spurs 4, Cavaliers 0 â The Spurs went 16-4 in the playoffs. Tim Duncan is a Top 10 player in NBA history and better than any of the players Jordan beat, with the exception of Magic. [Counter: 1991 Magic led the NBA in turnovers, his shooting from the field was in steady decline, he was only 2nd in the NBA in assists, and the Lakers were at the end of their dynasty, finishing 2nd in the West.] Tony Parker was the MVP of this series, and just for fun â¦ in the annals of NBA history, who will wind up thought of as the better player, Tony Parker or Gary Payton? Tony Parker or John Stockton?\n\n2011: Mavericks 4, Heat 2 â Dirk Nowitzki is considered one of the best shooting forwards in NBA history. Barkley or Dirk? Barkley was 29 on his only trip to the Finals, and averaged 27 points and 13 rebounds in that series. He had 32-12-10 in a Game 4 loss, and 42-13 in a Game 2 loss. Dirk or Kemp? Dirk or Mailman? Dirk averaged 26-9 in the 2011 Finals, and made 45 of 46 free throws. Fun discussion where thereâs no right or wrong answer: Was Dirk a more complete player than Barkley, Kemp and Mailman? The Mavs beat Kobe, Durant and LeBron in the postseason.\n\n2012: Heat 4, Thunder 1 â Difficult to say how good this Thunder team was. We may not know for a few years. But at this rate, Durant and Westbrook (assuming they stick together) could end up having Hall of Fame careers and being similar to Stockton/Malone, who went to the Finals twice. Jordan never faced a dominant young scoring tandem such as Durant and Westbrook in the Finals.\n\n2013: Heat 4, Spurs 3: Duncan at 37, Ginobili at 35. And San Antonio benefited from the Westbrook injury (and swept the Lakers minus Kobe). The West was such a mess, the Spurs struggled against the Warriors (4-2), then swept the Grizzlies, who were only there because of the Westbrook injury. Iâd compare these Spurs tot he 1991 Lakers, but that Laker team was injured and not nearly as old. Comparing across decades is impossible and an exercise in futility, but wouldnât this yearâs Spurs team have beaten any of Jordanâs Finals opponents?\n\nHereâs how Iâd rank the 10 opponents Jordan and LeBron have faced in the Finals:\n\n1. 2007 Spurs (LeBron)\n2. 1991 Lakers (Jordan)\n3. 2011 Mavericks (LeBron)\n4. 1997 Jazz (Jordan)\n5. 1998 Jazz (Jordan)\n6. 2013 Spurs (LeBron)\n7. 2012 Thunder (LeBron)\n8. 1993 Suns (Jordan)\n9. 1996 Sonics (Jordan)\n10. 1992 Blazers (Jordan)\n\nÂ© 2025 TheBigLead - All Rights Reserved\n\n"

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\n\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\n\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\n\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\n\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\n\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something.\n\nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\n\nThe overall picture\n\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\n\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\n\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\n\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\n\nNot so fast...\n\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\n\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\n\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\n\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\n\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\n\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\n\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\n\n\n\nIt's not just the first round either.\n\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\n\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\n\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat.\n\nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\n\nTeam | Round | Rating | Who? | Result\n1986 Celtics | 1st Round | 1770 | MJ | Lost\n1989 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1767 | MJ | Lost\n2008 Celtics | Conf Semis | 1700 | LeBron | Lost\n2011 Bulls | Conf Finals | 1698 | LeBron | Won\n1985 Bucks | 1st Round | 1697 | MJ | Lost\n1993 Knicks | Conf Finals | 1696 | MJ | Won\n1990 Pistons | Conf Finals | 1686 | MJ | Lost\n1998 Pacers | Conf Finals | 1680 | MJ | Won\n2009 Magic | Conf Finals | 1680 | LeBron | Lost\n1987 Celtics | 1st Round | 1676 | MJ | Lost\n1996 Magic | Conf Finals | 1671 | MJ | Won\nDid LeBron have it easier prior to reaching the Finals? Yes.\n\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\n\nFinals opponents\n\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\n\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\n\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year.\n\nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition.\n\nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\n\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\n\nTeam | Rating | Opponent\n2017 Warriors | 1850 | LeBron\n2015 Warriors | 1802 | LeBron\n2016 Warriors | 1790 | LeBron\n1998 Jazz | 1762 | MJ\n1997 Jazz | 1751 | MJ\n2012 Thunder | 1737 | LeBron\n2014 Spurs | 1730 | LeBron\n2011 Mavericks | 1717 | LeBron\n2013 Spurs | 1711 | LeBron\n2018 Warriors | 1710 | LeBron\n2007 Spurs | 1705 | LeBron\n1992 Blazers | 1702 | MJ\n1991 Lakers | 1697 | MJ\n1996 Sonics | 1695 | MJ\n1993 Suns | 1634 | MJ\nIt's a team sport!\n\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\n\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\n\nIt's impossible to know.\n\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings.\n\n | Jordan | LeBron\nTeam rating | 1770 | 1687\nOpponent | 1706 | 1750\nDifference | +64 | -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\n\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\n\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\n\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\n\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does all of this mean?\n\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\n\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\n\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\n\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\n\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nMicah Adams\n\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.
