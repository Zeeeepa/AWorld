That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something. \nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\nThe overall picture\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\nNot so fast...\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\nIt's not just the first round either.\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat. \nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\nHardest Pre-Finals Opponents\nTeam    Round   Rating  Who?

Yes.\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\nFinals opponents\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year. \nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition. \nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\nEvery Finals Opponent\nTeam    Rating  Opponent\n2017 Warriors   1850    LeBron\n2015 Warriors   1802    LeBron\n2016 Warriors   1790    LeBron\n1998 Jazz   1762    MJ\n1997 Jazz   1751    MJ\n2012 Thunder    1737    LeBron\n2014 Spurs  1730    LeBron\n2011 Mavericks  1717    LeBron\n2013 Spurs  1711    LeBron\n2018 Warriors   1710    LeBron\n2007 Spurs  1705    LeBron\n1992 Blazers    1702    MJ\n1991 Lakers 1697    MJ\n1996 Sonics 1695    MJ\n1993 Suns   1634    MJ\nIt's a team sport!\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\nIt's impossible to know.\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings. \nELO Rating in Finals\n    Jordan  LeBron\nTeam rating 1770    1687\nOpponent    1706    1750\nDifference  +64 -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\nMJ and LeBron in Finals\nInfogram\nWhat does all of this mean?\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\nMICAH ADAMS\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.

What if LeBron James had played against these guys?\n\nThe tone of that question goes one of two ways. If you believe the late 1980s and early 1990s were the golden era of the NBA, you’re asking it derisively. LeBron against the REAL MEN of Jordan’s era? No chance. If you aren’t that nostalgic, you’re asking it gleefully. LeBron against those basketball Neanderthals? It’s about to get ugly for them.\n\nUnless there’s a secret time travel portal out there, we can’t test either hypothesis. The best we can do is measure the relative strength of the teams that Jordan and James faced in their many playoff runs. We’ll use net rating, or the difference between each team’s points scored and allowed per 100 possessions. That data can’t settle the MJ-LeBron debate entirely, but it can give us insight into whose roads to victory were tougher – albeit with some caveats.\n\nJordan faced a tougher playoff path\n\nAverage wins and net rating* for teams led by Michael Jordan and LeBron James and their playoff opponents, 1984-85 through 2018-19 seasons\n\n | Average wins | Average Net Rating\nPlayer | Own Team | Playoff Opp. | Own Team | Playoff Opp.\nMichael Jordan | 58.38 | 53.54 | 7.29 | 4.58\nLeBron James | 55.44 | 51.77 | 5.34 | 3.97\n*Net rating is the difference between points scored and allowed per 100 possessions.\n\nSource: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nThe average team Jordan faced in his 37 playoff series posted a regular-season net rating of +4.58, which translates into somewhere between 53 and 54 wins using a Pythagorean win percentage calculator. The average team LeBron faced in his 45 (and counting) series posted a regular-season net rating of +3.97, which roughly equates to a 52-win team. (The difference shrinks when removing Jordan’s three first-round playoff defeats to much superior opponents, but it still exists.)\n\nThat’s not a massive difference, but it is a material one. To put it in LeBronian terms, it’s only a bit less than the difference between the 2013 Pacers team that pushed LeBron’s Heat to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals (+4.5 net rating) and the 2016 Hawks squad that James’s Cavaliers swept mercilessly in the second round (+3.7 net rating).\n\nThe gap widens when considering only series victories. Jordan’s average playoff victim went 52-30 in the regular season with a net rating of +4.06. LeBron’s, on the other hand, went just 49-33 with a net rating of +2.82. That’s the difference between the 1992 Knicks, one of two teams to extend Chicago to seven games during Jordan’s title runs,1 and the 2017 Celtics, who fell meekly to LeBron’s Cavs in five despite possessing home-court advantage.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that MJ’s opponents would beat LeBron’s if they were to play head-to-head. But it does show that Jordan’s victims were generally better in the specific season they faced the Bulls.\n\nSo why does MJ come out on top? There are two obvious reasons. One is that Jordan’s teams were much better than LeBron’s. Jordan’s Bulls averaged more than 58 wins a season with a net rating of +7.29, while James’s average club won 55 games. Jordan’s Bulls were also the Vegas betting favorite in 91 percent of their series beginning in 1988, the first year those odds are available,2 compared with just 76 percent for LeBron’s. You’ll never believe this, but better teams tend to win more in the playoffs than worse teams.\n\nWere Jordan’s teams better because Jordan is that much better than LeBron individually? Maybe. Were they better because Jordan had teammates that fit better alongside him? Maybe. It likely helped Jordan that he stayed with one franchise that built around him throughout his playoff career, as opposed to James, who hopped around from Cleveland, to Miami and back to Cleveland. But even LeBron’s Heat teams that were supposedly loaded with stars had a lower average net rating than the Bulls did over Jordan’s entire tenure.\n\nThe second obvious reason explains why LeBron both got to the NBA Finals more often and lost more often once there. Yes, the East really was stronger in MJ’s day.\n\nThe East was better when Jordan ruled it\n\nAverage wins, losses, Simple Rating System strength and net ratings* of the seven other Eastern Conference playoff teams during the playoff runs of Michael Jordan and LeBron James\n\n | Other Eastern Conference playoff teams\n | Wins | Losses | SRS | Net rating\nMichael Jordan |  |  |  | \n1985-1998 (no 1994) | 48.80 | 33.20 | 2.68 | 2.76\n1985-1993 (Bulls) | 48.39 | 33.61 | 2.55 | 2.54\n1995-1998 (Bulls) | 49.71 | 32.29 | 2.95 | 3.24\nLeBron James |  |  |  | \n2006-2018 | 47.28 | 34.70 | 1.81 | 2.37\n2006-2010 (Cavs) | 47.26 | 34.74 | 2.11 | 2.60\n2011-2014 (Heat) | 47.20 | 34.73 | 1.68 | 2.45\n2015-2018 (Cavs) | 47.39 | 34.61 | 1.56 | 2.00\n*Net rating is the difference between points scored and allowed per 100 possessions.\n\nWins in the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season were prorated for an 82-game season.\n\nSource: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nThe average East playoff team in Jordan’s era was much better than the average East playoff team in LeBron’s, even though Jordan’s Bulls were also better than LeBron’s Cavs and Heat. If anything, this table undersells the difficult East that Jordan (usually) defeated. Jordan’s average Eastern Conference finals opponent was nearly a point better in net rating than James’s.\n\nThe flip side is that James’s NBA Finals opponents were much tougher than Jordan’s. MJ never faced a finals foe as dominant as the 2015, 2016 and 2017 Warriors and only once bested a team better than the Spurs that swept James’s upstart Cavaliers in 2007. But James also faced four of the five worst finals opponents of the bunch, at least based on regular-season net rating.\n\nLeBron faced the Finals’ best … and lost to the worst\n\nNBA Finals teams and opponents of Michael Jordan and LeBron James by regular-season net rating* and wins\n\n | Wins | Net Rating\nYear | Champ? | Team | Opponent | Team | Opp. | Team | Opp.\n2017 |  | Cavaliers | Warriors | 51 | 67 | 3.3 | 11.6\n2016 | ✓ | Cavaliers | Warriors | 57 | 73 | 6.4 | 10.7\n2015 |  | Cavaliers | Warriors | 53 | 67 | 4.8 | 10.2\n1997 | ✓ | Bulls | Jazz | 69 | 64 | 12.0 | 9.6\n2007 |  | Cavaliers | Spurs | 50 | 58 | 4.2 | 9.3\n1996 | ✓ | Bulls | SuperSonics | 72 | 64 | 13.4 | 8.2\n2014 |  | Heat | Spurs | 54 | 62 | 5.1 | 8.1\n1998 | ✓ | Bulls | Jazz | 62 | 62 | 7.9 | 7.3\n1992 | ✓ | Bulls | Trail Blazers | 67 | 57 | 11.0 | 7.2\n1991 | ✓ | Bulls | Lakers | 61 | 58 | 9.4 | 7.1\n2013 | ✓ | Heat | Spurs | 66 | 58 | 8.6 | 6.7\n2012 | ✓ | Heat | Thunder | 57 | 58 | 6.4 | 6.6\n1993 | ✓ | Bulls | Suns | 57 | 62 | 6.8 | 6.6\n2018 |  | Cavaliers | Warriors | 50 | 58 | 1.0 | 6.0\n2011 |  | Heat | Mavericks | 58 | 57 | 8.2 | 4.7\n*Net rating is the difference between points scored and allowed per 100 possessions.\n\nWins in the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season were prorated for an 82-game season.\n\nSource: Basketball-Reference.com\n\nThere are two silver linings for LeBron defenders:\n\nJames had the best overall playoff series victory of the two: The 2015-16 Warriors had a net rating of +10.7, more than a point higher than the toughest team Jordan beat.

James, on the other hand, more often won with a worse team than Jordan, or at least came closer than expected.\n\nTo calculate this, I found the net rating for each series the two stars played. Then I subtracted the regular-season net rating differential between their team and their playoff opponent.

Still, James ripping apart his toughest East opponents instead of just beating them is a feather in his cap. James turned it on more in the playoffs than Jordan — at least by this method.\n\n(Makes you wonder how the same star who pushed the great 2008 Celtics to seven with a horrid supporting cast could also lose decisively to a Spurs team in 2014 that was closer to his team’s equal than the final series margin would suggest, as well as fall to three teams from 2009 to 2011 that were worse than his.)\n\nOtherwise, though, Jordan did in fact face tougher opposition than LeBron. This alone shouldn’t settle the debate over who’s the GOAT, but it at least gives Jordan backers more supporting evidence to use.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe other was the 1998 Pacers.\n\nThough the Bulls were likely to be underdogs in their first three playoff series with Jordan.\n\nMike Prada is an NBA writer and editor who watches way more basketball than is healthy.

The combined regular-season record of MJ’s postseason rivals was 1,981-1,053. LeBron James’? 2,070-1,227\n\nSo yeah, MJ’s opponents did slightly better in the regular season on average than LeBron’s.\n\nIn his playoff career, Jordan faced nine 60-win teams and only lost two of those series. Outside of the Warriors this season, LeBron has played seven 60-win squads… with a 3-4 record.\n\nIf we look at the star power they had in front during their postseason runs, things are pretty balanced. We looked up the number of All-Star appearances, All-NBA 1st/2nd Team selections and MVP trophies opponents racked up the years they faced either Jordan or James in the playoffs.\n\nThat’s basically a tie.\n\nMJ met Larry Bird, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone in the playoffs in seasons in which they won the Maurice Podoloff trophy. LeBron did the same thing with Derrick Rose and twice with Stephen Curry.\n\nSo what’s your take?\n\nMichael Jordan, Top, Research\n\nResearch, Michael Jordan, Top, LeBron James, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nTop Rumors\n\nMike Budenholzer: 'No conversations' about returning as Suns coach next season\n\nMain Rumors\n\nLuka Doncic on Dallas: I love this city, I love these fans, but it's time to move on\n\nMain Rumors\n\nLuka Doncic goes off for 45 points as Lakers blow out Mavericks\n\nLATEST\n\nMain Rumors 3hr ago\n\nIvica Zubac notches first career triple-double in Clippers' win over Rockets\n\nMain Rumors· April 10, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 3hr ago\n\nNuggets take step toward playoffs with first win post-Michael Malone\n\nMain Rumors· April 10, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 3hr ago\n\nHarrison Barnes stuns Warriors with game-winning three at the buzzer\n\nMain Rumors· April 10, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 3hr ago\n\nSuns eliminated from postseason contention after loss to Jalen Williams-led Thunder\n\nMain Rumors· April 10, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 3hr ago\n\nKyle Filipowski's career night lifts Jazz past Blazers in OT\n\nMain Rumors· April 10, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 4hr ago\n\nLuka Doncic on Dallas: I love this city, I love these fans, but it's time to move on\n\nMain Rumors· April 9, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 4hr ago\n\nLuka Doncic goes off for 45 points as Lakers blow out Mavericks\n\nMain Rumors· April 9, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 4hr ago\n\nLuka Doncic: When I was watching that video I was like, ‘There’s no way I’m playing this game'\n\nMain Rumors· April 9, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 7hr ago\n\nLuka Doncic gets emotional after Mavericks' three-minute tribute video\n\nMain Rumors· April 9, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nMain Rumors 7hr ago\n\nLeBron James passes Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for second on all-time games played list\n\nMain Rumors· April 9, 2025 \n·\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\t\t\tHoopsHype\n\nFollow HH!\n\nSocial\n\nPodcast\n\nMost Popular\n\n2025 NBA free agent rankings: The best players available this summer\n\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope on firing of his former head coach Michael Malone: There's been a lot going on over there\n\nLegendary NBA writer Jack McCallum: Michael Jordan kind of needed Sports Illustrated.
