        "raw_content": "\"If you put off-the-court into it, it's not even close\" - Shannon Sharpe cites LeBron James' all-around game as a reason for him to be called the G.O.A.T. over Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James is doing historic things this season, spurring on the G.O.A.T conversation multiple times. He was on an offensive outburst, surpassing Karl Malone to take the second spot on the all-time scoring list and hadn’t slowed down until his ankle injury that now has him on the sidelines.\n\nLeBron James’ former assistant coach, Jason Kidd, picked James as the G.O.A.T. in a recent interview – citing his impact both on and off the court as the reason. Kidd called James a complete package, for using his influence to drive change in the society – with the list of ventures that he is part of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidd’s comments sparked a debate on “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed”, with Shannon Sharpe going to bat for LeBron James – and not just based on his off-court presence:\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThroughout his career, LeBron James has been playing elite basketball while adapting with time. He has played in different eras, changed his game to showcase his playmaking abilities and won four championships along the way.\n\nAlthough Michael Jordan has been perfect in the NBA Finals, winning in all of his six appearances, Shannon Sharpe is not holding that against him:\n\nWhile on-court impact is a bigger criterion in determining the greatness of a player, LeBron James has used his voice and popularity to facilitate change. His initiatives with the I-Promise school and other charitable contributions, his openness in discussing societal issues and using his platform for the right reasons – far surpass what Michael Jordan did back in the day.\n\nShannon Sharpe then summed-up his argument by saying:\n\nLeBron James’ injury is diminishing playoff hopes for the LA Lakers\n\nLeBron James’ nineteenth season in the league could be further reduced if the Lakers are unable to win games in the final stretch. The LA Lakers (31-44) are back in tenth place after the San Antonio Spurs (31-45) suffered a defeat against the Memphis Grizzlies last night. But the schedule for the Lakers is not very favorable.\n\nWith no clarity on when James or Anthony Davis will be back, the Lakers will have to face the Utah Jazz, Phoenix Suns and Denver Nuggets, among other teams.\n\nThe team is on a three-game losing streak and will face the New Orleans Pelicans (33-43) in a must-win fixture once they return home. What was planned to be a title contention season is now hanging by a thread, while James can only hope for a quick recovery.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

        "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nLeBron changed the game as a basketball prodigy\n\nLeBron James became a millionaire two weeks before his high school graduation when he inked an endorsement deal with Upper Deck that included a $1 million signing bonus.\n\nBut he earned bigger money six months earlier on a frigid night in December when he delivered in the most pressure-packed moment of his career to that point -- a game against No. 1-ranked Oak Hill Academy broadcast live on ESPN2. He finished with 31 points, 16 rebounds and 6 assists -- fairly standard for him in high school -- and somehow managed to exceed unprecedented expectations.\n\nBefore that moment, he was a curiosity. Afterward, he was a bona fide commodity. It was James' first truly game-changing moment.\n\nHe has had a few more since then, indeed, but few have been as indelible as Dec. 12, 2002. It was a huge event in James' life and a central feature in both a book and a documentary about his senior year of high school.\n\nIt was the first time ESPN had televised a high school basketball game in 13 years, wrapped with pregame and postgame coverage, a feature at halftime and the cover story of ESPN The Magazine that week.\n\n#NBArank: Game Changers\n\n\n\nWe're counting down the 100 most influential players in NBA history.\n\n• Game Changers: 100-76\n• Game Changers: 75-51\n• Game Changers: 50-26\n• Game Changers: 25-1\n\nFrom the archives:\n• #NBArank: Best players ever\n• #NBArank: All-time kicks\n\nDan Shulman, Dick Vitale, Bill Walton and Jay Bilas were on hand to call the game, which got more than 1.5 million viewers, the second most in ESPN2's history at the time. Many came to watch James fail, to flip the channel and declare him a product of hype. Instead, in the first half, James was slamming home dunks and throwing mind-numbing passes that elicited \"Are you serious?\" screams from Vitale.\n\nThe highlights that game created were replayed around the globe, and James' star went white hot. That evening was probably the basis for the seven-year, $100 million deal he got from Nike the following spring. James was always going to receive an impressive shoe deal, but after that night, competing companies decided they had to have him. Just three weeks later, for example, Nike founder Phil Knight flew to watch James in person to amp up the recruiting.\n\nIt wasn't the largest endorsement deal of all time, but that nine-figure wager from Nike (Reebok was right there with them in the bidding) on an 18-year-old before the NBA even held its draft lottery that year remains one of the most remarkable deals in the history of American sports. James changed the paradigm for what a basketball prodigy was, and there still hasn't been anyone quite like him since.\n\nThe list of James' accomplishments since entering the league is well known, but he's continuing to write his story and refine his legacy. In what portends to be a significant achievement, sometime next year James should become the first player in history to be in the top 10 all time in both points and assists. That's a distinction that will carry a great honor for him, as he has always wanted to be known as a playmaker and not just as a scorer. He has a chance to move into the top 50 all time in total rebounds next season as well. In the playoffs, he's already the all-time leader in scoring, second in steals and third in assists.\n\nCounting stats can be a tribute to longevity, but James' game-changing career hasn't been just about volume. His actions off the court have set new standards and created new goals for so many of his peers, a form of respect in any profession.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nHow LeBron James fixed his back and is on track to play all 82 games7yBrian Windhorst\n\nLeBron on 14th triple-double: I'm like fine wine7yDave McMenamin\n\nYes, \"The Decision\" broadcast was panned for its poor taste, but the concept has aged well. Players now routinely take control of announcing their big career decisions and craft essays to explain themselves. James' personal essay in Sports Illustrated when he returned to Cleveland in 2014 came four months before The Players' Tribune launched as a platform for professional athletes.\n\nHe was far from the first high-profile athlete to speak out politically, but James' willingness to put his voice behind social causes has encouraged numerous pros to follow. In 2012, when James and Dwyane Wade organized their Miami Heat teammates to pose for a team photo in hoodies after the death of Trayvon Martin, it changed the way NBA players used social media.\n\nRanking anyone in a category as nebulous as \"game-changer\" is inherently challenging because the games have so much nuance to them, and personality, talent and charisma intersect at so many angles. James has been called many things in his life and launched as many arguments as he has 3-point shots.\n\nOn this topic, though, there's little need for debate. James' status as a game-changer is undisputed.\n\n"

Greg Anthony, a former NBA player who is now a commentator and TV analyst, joined Geoff Bennett to discuss how LeBron changed the game.\n\nRead the Full Transcript\n\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nHe is known as King James in the world of basketball, and, last night, LeBron James only added to that title and his legend, when he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the all-time scoring king in NBA history.\n\nHe blew past a record that stood for nearly 40 years.\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nLooking for James. He's got it. Coming to the end of the third quarter. LeBron James, a shot at history. And there it is!\n\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\n\nAnnouncer:\n\nLeBron stands alone! The NBA's all-time scoring record now belongs to LeBron James!\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nAfter the game, LeBron was asked by Shaquille O'Neal on TNT whether he now considers himself to be the greatest basketball player of all time.\n\nLeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers:\n\nI'm going to take myself against anybody that has ever played his game. But everyone's going to have their favorite. Everyone's going to decide who their favorite is. But I know what I have brought to the table. I know what I bring to the table every single night and what I can — what I can do out on this floor.\n\nSo, I always feel like I'm the best to ever play this game, but there's so many other great ones that I'm happy to just be a part of their — part of their journey.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nLet's bring in Greg Anthony, a commentator and analyst for NBA TV. And he's a former guard who played in the league for 11 years for the Knicks, Grizzlies, Blazers, and Bulls.\n\nGreg Anthony, we appreciate you being with us.\n\nAnd, look, LeBron James says, as far as he's concerned, he's the best to ever play the game. You can't really argue with that, or can you?\n\nGreg Anthony, NBA TV Analyst:\n\nWell, it's very difficult to argue with it.\n\nWhile he's immensely popular, he won't necessarily be the most popular and at times can be polarizing. But I do think his accomplishments kind of set him apart. To be considered the all — to be the all-time leading scorer, he's won four world championships. He's won four MVPs, still playing at an extremely high level, probably be All NBA again in his 20th season.\n\nIt's really hard to go against that. I think a better way to have perspective on this also is, if you think about over the last, I don't know, 100 years of pro sports, we have had two athletes that probably had more hype than anybody else prior to them. And what's amazing is, both have exceeded the expectations.\n\nAnd that's Tiger Woods and LeBron James. You have to remember, this is a young man that came right out of high school, and he was dubbed the chosen one. And so often, as I'm sure you're well aware of, when young athletes have that much hype and that large of an expectation placed upon them, the pressure oftentimes consumes them and overwhelms them.\n\nAnd that has not been the case with LeBron. Also, he has been an incredible ambassador for our game. He's grown the game immensely. He's always been — had the courage to go out and put forth his beliefs, his philosophy, and speak out and speak up for those who maybe were less fortunate.\n\nSo, with that comes a lot of arrows as well. But, for me, I would say he is the greatest ever. And, listen, it doesn't take away from a Michael Jordan or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Bill Russell. All of these greats were that and they were the greatest that their time.\n\nBut as the game has evolved, if you look at the level of talent in our league now, it has never been as high. And, therefore, to be the best unquestionably in this era, it's kind of hard to argue against it.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nWell, to your point about him not succumbing to the pressure, I mean, he had the nickname King James back when he was playing ball in high school.\n\nHow did this kid from Akron turn out to be one of, if not the best basketball player of all time?\n\nGreg Anthony:\n\nIt's an incredible journey, if you think about it, raised by a single mom who had him at a very young age, and was never, I think, overwhelmed by the temptations of success as a young person.\n\nIf you think about his work ethic, his discipline, the way he's conducted himself in an era and an age where it's really difficult to, in essence, go unscathed, if you will, especially when you put yourself out there, as LeBron has, I don't know that we could have had — ever had a better ambassador for the game of basketball.\n\nHe is truly grown it, grown the game. And I marvel at what this young man has been able to overcome, bringing a championship to Cleveland, arguably being the greatest team ever assembled. That team won 73 games. They broke the all-time win record set by Michael Jordan and the great Bulls teams he had in the '90s.\n\nAnd they were down 3-1 in that series. And for him to be able to come back and win that, that's probably the seminal moment in his career, but he won three other championships. He made — played in eight consecutive finals. And to have those kinds of accomplishments, it's just rare in this day and age.\n\nHe's won a championship and a finals MVP on three different teams. No one's ever done anything like that.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nRight.\n\nAnd, look, LeBron James is 38 years old. He's in season 20 of his NBA playing career. By conventional basketball playing standards, he's an old man, but he says he's going to keep playing. He's averaging 30 points a game right now. How high could his scoring record go?\n\nGreg Anthony:\n\nThat's a great question.\n\nWell, I know for a fact he has said he wants to play in the NBA with his son, Bronny. And so I'm going to assume that Bronny is probably a couple years away from making it to the NBA. So, realistically, I think he's going to play another three, four years. You factor at the level he's playing — again, in his 20th season, he's going to make All NBA, which is just an incredible feat.\n\nI do think he's got a good three or four years at a really high level. So that scoring record could be really put out of the stratosphere, if you will.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nGreg Anthony is a commentator and analyst for NBA TV.\n\nAppreciate your time and your insights.\n\nGreg Anthony:\n\nMy pleasure.\n\nListen to this Segment\n\nWatch the Full Episode\n\nRelated\n\nFeb 08\n\nBy Tim Reynolds, Associated Press\n\nFeb 07\n\nBy Tim Reynolds, Associated Press\n\nOct 12\n\nGo Deeper\n\nGeoff Bennett\n\n\n                    Geoff Bennett\n\nGeoff Bennett serves as co-anchor and co-managing editor of PBS News Hour.

Their paths to stardom, however, took different routes shaped by their unique circumstances and abilities.\nLeBron James: The Prodigy from Akron\nLeBron James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. His exceptional talent became evident early on, drawing national attention while still in high school. At St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, James led his team to three state championships.\nHis scoring and passing abilities were unparalleled for his age. James averaged 31.6 points per game as a senior, securing his position as the top high school player in the nation.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers selected James as the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. He immediately impacted the league, averaging 20.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds in his rookie season.\nMichael Jordan: Crafting a Legend in Carolina\nMichael Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York. He famously failed to make his high school varsity team as a sophomore, using this setback as motivation to improve.\nJordan’s talent blossomed at the University of North Carolina. He hit the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game as a freshman. Jordan averaged 17.7 points per game over three seasons in college.\nThe Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan third overall in 1984. He quickly established himself as a prolific scorer, averaging 28.2 points per game in his rookie season. Jordan’s shooting accuracy and athleticism set him apart from his peers.\nDominance on the Court\nLeBron James has showcased unparalleled dominance across multiple facets of the game. His blend of scoring prowess, playmaking ability, and defensive impact sets him apart as a more complete player than Michael Jordan.\nScoring Abilities: Titles and Averages\nLeBron James has consistently demonstrated elite scoring capabilities throughout his career. While he may not have as many scoring titles as Jordan, James has maintained an impressive career scoring average of 27.2 points per game.\nHis versatility as a scorer allows him to excel in various situations. James can drive to the basket with power, shoot from mid-range, and knock down three-pointers with accuracy.\nIn the 2019-2020 season, at age 35, James led the league in assists while still averaging 25.3 points per game. This highlights his ability to maintain high scoring output even as he has evolved his game.\nAssist and Playmaking Skills\nLeBron James’s playmaking abilities far surpass those of Michael Jordan.

James’ unparalleled combination of size, speed, and strength allows him to dominate on both ends of the court.\nPhysicality and Durability\nAt 6’9″ and 250 pounds, LeBron James possesses a rare blend of size and agility. His frame allows him to overpower smaller defenders while maintaining the quickness to blow past larger opponents.\nJames’ durability is remarkable, having played over 1,400 NBA games across 20 seasons. He has avoided major injuries throughout his career, demonstrating exceptional physical resilience.\nHis vertical leap, measured at 44 inches, rivals that of smaller guards.

He processes the game at an elite level, anticipating plays before they develop. His photographic memory allows him to recall specific game situations with incredible detail.\nHis court vision and passing ability are extraordinary. James averages 7.4 assists per game for his career, showcasing his skill in creating opportunities for teammates.\nHe excels at reading defenses and making split-second decisions. This ability to analyze and exploit opposing strategies in real-time sets him apart from other players.\nSports Science and Training Regimen\nJames invests heavily in his body, reportedly spending $1.5 million annually on physical maintenance.

His exceptional performances and longevity have allowed him to accumulate impressive accolades on basketball’s biggest stage.\nFinals Appearances and Victories\nLeBron James has made 10 NBA Finals appearances, significantly more than Michael Jordan’s 6. This feat demonstrates James’ ability to consistently lead his teams to the championship round across multiple franchises. James has won 4 NBA championships with three different teams: the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Los Angeles Lakers. While Jordan won 6 championships, all with the Chicago Bulls, James’ success with multiple organizations showcases his adaptability and leadership.\nJames’ Finals appearances span a longer period, from 2007 to 2020, highlighting his sustained excellence and ability to compete at the highest level for over a decade. His championships have come against formidable opponents, including the Golden State Warriors dynasty and the San Antonio Spurs.\nPerformance in NBA Finals\nIn the NBA Finals, LeBron James has consistently delivered outstanding individual performances. He has averaged 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.8 assists per game across his Finals appearances.

It highlights his capacity to elevate different rosters to championship level. James’ Finals MVP performances have included historic achievements, such as leading the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history against the 73-win Warriors in 2016.\nHis Finals MVP awards span a longer period (2012-2020) compared to Jordan’s (1991-1998), demonstrating James’ sustained excellence at the highest level of competition.\nAwards and Recognition\nLeBron James has amassed an impressive collection of awards and honors throughout his career, solidifying his status as one of basketball’s all-time greats.
