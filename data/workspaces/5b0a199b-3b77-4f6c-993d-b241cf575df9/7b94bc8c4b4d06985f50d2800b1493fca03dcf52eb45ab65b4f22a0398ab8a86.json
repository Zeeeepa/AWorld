        "raw_content": "Complete comparison between LeBron James, Michael Jordan’s Finals opponents\n\nVirgil Villanueva\n\nSince winning multiple rings, LeBron James has crept his way into comparisons with Michael Jordan, the guy considered the best player of all time. Jordan reached the NBA Finals six times and won every one. James, meanwhile, has made it to eight times, including seven consecutive appearances, winning three titles.\n\nBut for Reddit user claimsman11, the aforementioned numbers are not enough. He posted a complete comparison between LeBron and Jordan’s opponents in the NBA Finals.\n\nConsidering all of Jordan’s opponents in the Finals, the offensive rating of those combined teams averaged out to fourth in the NBA and an defensive rating that averaged out to 7.5th in the league. LeBron’s foes, meanwhile, have an offensive rating that averaged out to 4.1 and a defensive rating that averaged out to 4.4.\n\nBy individual accolades, Jordan has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, two All-NBA 2nd, two All-NBA 3rd, three All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd tea.\n\nLeBron has gone up against five All-NBA 1st team members, seven All-NBA 2nd, three All-NBA 3rd, six All-NBA Defense 1st team, and three All-NBA Defense 2nd team.\n\nBoth of them have gone up against two MVPs.\n\nAnother user Naabahs, commented on the thread, this time comparing LeBron and Jordan’s opponents via SRS or Simple Rating System. The metric is rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule.\n\nThe user concluded that the average SRS for Jordan Finals opponents is 6.84, while the average SRS for LeBron Finals opponents is 8.20.\n\nApparently, the number of titles one has is not enough in determining who’s the greatest in the game. It is also determined by era and the rating of the teams they have played against.\n\n\n\n"

That's according to FiveThirtyEight's Complete History of the NBA which includes power ratings for every team after every single game in NBA history.\nMORE: Ranking all 37 of Jordan's playoff opponents\nOf course, these days nary a second goes by after uttering Jordan's name before the words \"LeBron James\" crashes the party.\nThe GOAT debate between the two legends has raged on for years and recently re-surfaced with the 10-episode arc chronicling Jordan's rise to power throughout the 1990s. As if that fire needed more fuel, ESPN released its updated list of top players of all-time earlier this week with Jordan claiming the top spot just ahead of James.\nHonestly, it's a debate that has no right or wrong answer so we're not going to bother getting into it right now.\nWhat we are here to do, however, is shed some light on the teams both legends beat en route to their place atop the NBA's Mt. Rushmore. In poring through all of Jordan's playoff opponents, I couldn't help but wonder how his road to six championships compares with LeBron's. While King James can't match Jordan's ring total, he holds a 9-6 edge in Finals appearances which shoud count for something. \nIs LeBron's count of Finals appearances inflated due to a weakened Eastern Conference? Or does his playoff record stack up favourably to Jordan?\nFor the purposes of this discussion, we're once again utilizing FiveThirtyEight's all-time team ratings. Curious about how it works? Read more about it here. Rather than bore you with the method beyond the madness, let's dive headfirst into the results sure to drive many mad.\nThe overall picture\nThere were 82 playoff opponents to consider in all — 37 for Jordan, 45 for James.\nIf you simply take the average rating of every team they played, Jordan comes out on top with the harder slate.\nMORE: The 76 players with perfect records against MJ\nCase closed then, right? That's it, problem solved... thanks for reading!\nNot so fast...\nThere's far more to it than meets the eye.\nLeBron's easier path to the Finals\nLeBron James has famously never lost in the 1st Round, a perfect 13-0 record.\nHe didn't just win, he pummels teams. Prior to the grueling seven-game series against the Pacers in 2018, he had won a ridiculous 21 consecutive games in the opening round, essentially never even sweating an early round exit for nearly a decade. The only two players under the current 16-team playoff format (since 1984) that can hold a candle to his early-round dominance are Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, both of whom went 16-0 in the 1st Round.\nUnlike Jordan, LeBron never faced a juggernaut early on.\nThe toughest opponent Jordan ever faced was the 1985-86 Celtics, one of the greatest teams in NBA history who swept Jordan's Bulls despite a stellar showing by the then second-year guard. In addition to that legendary Celtics team that featured five Hall of Famers, Jordan also squared off against a 59-win Milwaukee Bucks team in 1985 that featured the league's best defence spearheaded by two-time Defensive Player of the Year Sidney Moncrief. According to FiveThirtyEight, that Bucks team was better than 34 of the 36 teams that James has played in all rounds leading up to the NBA Finals.\nThe toughest opponent James has played in the first round was a 2011-12 Knicks team that fired Mike D'Antoni halfway through the season after an 18-24 start. That team starred Carmelo Anthony, a banged up Amar'e Stoudemire and J.R. Smith.\nIt's not just the first round either.\nIf you take every team that Jordan and James faced in the East, you'll find that it's Jordan who faced the stiffer competition in rounds leading up to the Finals.\nEight of the toughest 11 opponents belong to Jordan and if you limit it to just the years in which they reached the Finals, six of the top eight were MJ opponents.\nIt's even more drastic when looking strictly at who each of them faced in the Conference Finals. If you line up all 18 of their Conference Finals opponents, four of the top five were foes of Jordan's Bulls while seven of the bottom eight teams were ones that faced off against LeBron's Cavs or Heat. \nThe 1997-98 Pacers team featured in \"The Last Dance\" that pushed Jordan to seven games ranks higher than eight of the 10 teams LeBron has played in the Conference Finals. The one feather in LeBron's cap is the 2010-11 Bulls who went 62-20 and featured league MVP Derrick Rose. That Bulls team sports a higher ELO rating than any of the teams that Jordan beat in the East, barely edging out the 1993 Knicks.\nHardest Pre-Finals Opponents\nTeam    Round   Rating  Who?

Yes.\nBut once there... it's an entirely different story.\nFinals opponents\nThe low-hanging fruit is that Jordan never dealt with anyone quite like the Golden State Warriors, a historic juggernaut that just so happened to come along right smack in the middle of LeBron's stranglehold on the East.\nImagine if Jordan's prime ran parallel to Larry Bird's Celtics or Magic Johnson's Lakers? What if instead of catching the tail end of both, he instead ran into them year after year?\nThere's this tendency to think \"Warriors\" first and foremost when thinking about LeBron's trips to the Finals and while those teams certainy reign surpreme, they also in a way underscore the relative strength of his other Finals opponents. Back in 2017 I wrote about how LeBron's worst Finals opponent — the 2006-07 San Antonio Spurs — ranked in the 73rd percentile of Finals teams ever. That was before he took on the Warriors for the fourth straight year. \nAll nine of LeBron's Finals opponents rank among the top 36 teams ever to reach the NBA Finals, an astounding statement regarding his quality of opposition. \nEven more illuminating is when you factor in how those compare to the teams Michael Jordan squared off against when ammassing that unassailable 6-0 Finals record.\nThat Spurs team which grades out as the worst of the nine that James played against ranks higher than four of the six teams the Bulls beat, including all three from the first three-peat.\nEvery Finals Opponent\nTeam    Rating  Opponent\n2017 Warriors   1850    LeBron\n2015 Warriors   1802    LeBron\n2016 Warriors   1790    LeBron\n1998 Jazz   1762    MJ\n1997 Jazz   1751    MJ\n2012 Thunder    1737    LeBron\n2014 Spurs  1730    LeBron\n2011 Mavericks  1717    LeBron\n2013 Spurs  1711    LeBron\n2018 Warriors   1710    LeBron\n2007 Spurs  1705    LeBron\n1992 Blazers    1702    MJ\n1991 Lakers 1697    MJ\n1996 Sonics 1695    MJ\n1993 Suns   1634    MJ\nIt's a team sport!\nWould LeBron have gone 6-0 against the teams Jordan faced?\nWould Jordan have gone 3-6 against the teams LeBron faced?\nIt's impossible to know.\nBut in looking how each team stacked up to their respective opponents, we can get a sense for whether or not both won the right number of rings. \nELO Rating in Finals\n    Jordan  LeBron\nTeam rating 1770    1687\nOpponent    1706    1750\nDifference  +64 -63\nOn average, Jordan's teams entered the Finals with an ELO rating of 64 points higher than their opponents. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Mavericks.\nIf you take those Bulls teams and instead compare them to the average opponent faced by LeBron James, they would have entered the Finals with an ELO rating of just 20 points higher. That's about the difference this season between the Lakers and Bucks.\nWhat if we do the same for LeBron?\nCoincidentally, his teams on average entered with an ELO rating 63 points worse than his opponents. Even if you throw out the Warriors teams and only look at the other series, his teams on average had an ELO rating 32 points worse than their opponents.\nIn five of his six appearances in the Finals, Jordan entered with the better team. The exception? 1998, when the Bulls (1761) and Jazz (1762) entered with almost identical ELO ratings in what was essentially a coin flip.\nMJ and LeBron in Finals\nInfogram\nWhat does all of this mean?\nIn short, it doesn't change anything.\nBut it should at least frame how we think about 6-0 and 3-6 when it comes to debating the individual merits of MJ and LeBron.\nJordan probably wouldn't have gone 6-0 against the same level of competition that James faced in the NBA Finals.\nConversely, James probably goes better than 3-6 had he been fortunate enough to face teams like the ones that Jordan saw over the course of his run through the 90s.\nThe views expressed here to not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\nMICAH ADAMS\nMicah Adams is a Managing Editor and Head of Affiliate and Commercial Content at Sporting News.
