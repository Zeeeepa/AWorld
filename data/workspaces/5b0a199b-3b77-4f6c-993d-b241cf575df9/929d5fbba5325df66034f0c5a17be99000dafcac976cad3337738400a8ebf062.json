It’s the topic you bring up with the guy at the end of the bar on a Thursday when Lakers-Rockets is the only thing on TV. There are no shortage of opinions. This issue in particular is quite polarizing.\nOften the Lebron vs Jordan debate is studied and deliberated from emotional viewpoints. Maybe you’ll hear “Jordan was a killer, it didn’t matter that his supporting cast was better because he was the guy at the end of the day”. Or, perhaps, the guy at the end of the bar will claim “Jordan was good and won more championships, but there was no equivalent to the Spurs or Warriors in the 90s”.\nAs is typical with TheDataJocks, we want to take a statistical approach to the Lebron vs Jordan debate. However, we aren’t going to only look at basic box score statistics like points, rebounds, and assists. These stats don’t always tell the whole story.\nInstead, we’re going to approach the Jordan vs Lebron question by looking at how the advanced stats viewed each of the all-time greats.\n\nThe first constituent image is published under creative commons license by Erik Drost and the second is in the public domain.\nContents hide\n1 Why Advanced Stats?\n2 Lebron vs Jordan using Advanced Stats\n2.1 VORP\n2.2 PER\n2.3 Box Plus/Minus\n2.4 Win Shares\n2.5 Offensive and Defensive Statistics\n3 Final Lebron vs Jordan Scorecard\n3.1 Share this:\nTo receive email updates when new articles are posted, use the subscription form below!\nType your email…\nSubscribe\nWhy Advanced Stats?\nWhat do advanced stats do that traditional stats don’t? The short answer is context. Basic box score stats like points, rebounds, and assists don’t tell the whole story about how good a player is. The point of most advanced statistics is to go a step further and provide the context surrounding the basic box score stats.\nFor example, a player that scored 20 points against the 2nd stringers is not as impressive as a player that scored 20 against the starters. Advanced NBA stats will transform this raw number – 20 points scored – into a more telling number that captures how well the player played.\nThe advanced stats are not just an intellectual exercise for math nerds like myself. Some of the biggest NBA pundits including Kevin Pelton and Zach Lowe routinely use advanced statistics in their analyses. If you listen to The Lowe Post often enough, you’ll hear Zach Lowe say that advanced stats help him narrow down his list of candidates for the all-star ballot. It is safe to say that advanced stats are a reasonable barometer for a player’s overall quality.\nLebron vs Jordan using Advanced Stats\nWe’re going to compare Lebron James vs Michael Jordan using a few different advanced statistics. In each section, we’ll give a quick description of what each stat is meant to represent. Then we’ll see how Jordan and Lebron’s stats stack up against each other. The list of statistics we’ll use is:\n\nVORP (Value over Replacement Player)\nPER (Player Efficiency Rating)\nBox Plus/Minus\nWin Shares\nOffensive/Defensive Win Shares\nOffensive/Defensive Box Plus/Minus\n\nVORP\nThe first stat used in comparing Lebron vs Jordan is VORP. One way to measure how good player X is is to compare how well a team does with player X versus how well they would do with an average player.\nFor example, maybe replacing Lebron James with Kyle Kuzma makes your team 10 points worse. If replacing Michael Jordan with Kyle Kuzma would make your team 8 points worse, that would mean that Lebron was more valuable.\nThe figure below shows the top 5 all time players in career VORP. In each figure in this article, Lebron’s stats will be in yellow (for the Cavs & Lakers) while Jordan’s stats will be in red (for the Bulls). The rest of the players will be in blue.\n\nIn our first advanced stat, Lebron James edges out Michael Jordan. A side note before continuing onwards, Lebron James’ career VORP number is so impressive and so dominant that it actually showed up as an honorable mention in our conversation of the most unbreakable NBA record. His career overall value – derived as a combination of longevity and quality – is outstanding.\nAfter 1 category in the advanced metrics Lebron vs Jordan debate, the standings look like this:\n| Player\n | VORP\n| Total\n|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lebron\n| ✔\n| 1\n|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Jordan\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\nPER\nOur second stat is player efficiency rating. Each action a player takes contributes in some small way to the team’s overall performance. Some actions (like making a shot) contribute in a very positive way. Others (like a turnover) contribute in a negative way.\nPlayer efficiency rating adds together all a player’s actions and attempts to measure how many points a player directly accounted for. For a more in depth read, see our previous article which deep dives on PER.\nThe top 5 all time in PER are shown below.\n\nMichael Jordan strikes back! However, the top 3 all time in PER are much closer than they are in VORP. Still, a win is a win though.\nJordan is now on the board in the Lebron vs Jordan debate. The scoreboard is as follows:\n| Player\n | VORP\n| PER\n| Total\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lebron\n| ✔\n|  | 1\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jordan\n|  | ✔\n| 1\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\nBox Plus/Minus\nBox Plus/Minus is similar to VORP – its goal is to measure how good a player is relative to their peers/replacement players. While VORP asks how good a player is relative to league average, Box Plus/Minus asks how well a team performs when a certain player is on or off the court.\nIf a team does better with player X on the court than they do with that player off the court, then that player is a net positive. Measuring the difference between a player’s on court and off court numbers is basic plus/minus. Box plus/minus takes things a step further by considering the quality of opponents and teammates.\nThe top 5 career marks in box plus/minus are shown below:\n\nAnother point for Michael in the Lebron vs Jordan advanced metrics competition. The Lebron vs Jordan scoreboard is now as follows:\n| Player\n | VORP\n| PER\n| BPM\n| Total\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lebron\n| ✔\n|  |  | 1\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jordan\n|  | ✔\n| ✔\n| 2\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nWin Shares\nWin shares is yet another measure of the career quality of a basketball player. Win shares takes a slightly different approach. Instead of measuring player quality in ‘how many points’ a player is worth, it measures how many wins a player has accounted for.\nThe theory is that if a player worth 10 win shares is replaced with a 6 win share player, then the team as a whole should win 4 fewer games over the course of the season. The all time top 5 in win shares is shown in the graphic below.\n\nThis brings Lebron back to tied with Michael after 4 stats have been investigated. The Lebron vs Jordan scoreboard is tied at 2-2.\n| Player\n | VORP\n| PER\n| BPM\n| WS\n| Total\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lebron\n| ✔\n|  |  | ✔\n| 2\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jordan\n|  | ✔\n| ✔\n|  | 2\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nOffensive and Defensive Statistics\nThe three previous metrics we’ve looked at were holistic measures of a player’s performance. We wanted to also include two metrics each specifically designed to measure offensive and defensive quality separately.\nOffensive and defensive win shares are meant to estimate the number of wins a player has contributed to his teams’ totals on the offensive and defensive ends of the court, respectively. Offensive and defensive box plus/minus is an analog to box plus/minus split over the offensive and defensive ends of the court.\nAs it turns out….Jordan and Lebron tie in these four stats too! In offensive win shares, Lebron edges Jordan 176 (and counting) to 150. In defensive win shares, Lebron wins by a score of 77 win shares to 64.\nHowever, in both offensive and defensive box plus/minus Jordan beats Lebron. On the offensive side, Jordan wins 7.17 to 7.01. It is very close and these are the two best all-time marks, but I expect Lebron’s number to decrease a bit before he is done as he tacks some post-prime seasons onto his resume. On the defensive side, Jordan wins 2.05 to 1.76.\nFinal Lebron vs Jordan Scorecard\nTotaling all 8 advanced stats we’ve considered gives us the following final scorecard comparing Lebron vs Jordan.\n| Player\n | VORP\n| PER\n| BPM\n| WS\n| Off / Def WS\n| Off / Def BPM\n| Total\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lebron\n| ✔\n|  |  | ✔\n| ✔✔\n|  | 4\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jordan\n|  | ✔\n| ✔\n|  |  | ✔✔\n| 4\n|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nUnfortunately, looking at these 8 advanced metrics don’t help us settle the Jordan vs Lebron debate. However, this exercise revealed something significant. And, the more you think about it, the Lebron vs Jordan debate boils down to this:\nJordan beats Lebron in the rate stats, Lebron beats Jordan in the counting stats. VORP and WS are both ‘counting stats’ which accrue higher and higher as the years go on. PER and BPM are rate stats which measure quality per minute or game played.\nThis means that Jordan had a higher peak than Lebron but Lebron was very good for a much longer time. Take their best individual seasons, Jordan will beat Lebron. Take their 10 best seasons and Lebron will beat Jordan.\nPerhaps this is one reason the Lebron vs Jordan debate is so difficult to settle. It comes down to what you mean by the best player. Is it how good they were at their best? Is it about longevity? People will understandably have different opinions and, as a result, will come to different conclusions in the Lebron vs Jordan debate. I don’t think we’ll ever settle the argument.\nTo receive email updates when new articles are posted, use the subscription form below!\nType your email…\nSubscribe\nShare this:\n\nFacebook\nX\n\nPosted in Basketball\n\nPublished by jdashbrock\nView all posts by jdashbrock\nPost navigation\nPrev The Most Unbreakable NFL Record (Mathematically!)\nNext Larry Bird vs Magic Johnson with Advanced Metrics and Stats\nSearch\nSearch\nAmphibious Theme by TemplatePocket ⋅ Powered by WordPress\nClose this module\n\nSubscribe for Email alerts when new articles are posted!\nFirst NameJohn\nLast NameSmith\nYour emailjohnsmith@example.com\nSubmit\nNever see this message again.\n![Image 10](https://pixel.wp.com/g.gif?v=ext&blog=177793110&post=1637&tz=-5&srv=thedatajocks.com&j=1%3A14.4.1&host=thedatajocks.com&ref=&fcp=524&rand=0.10119607867456981)\n"

Showdown\n\nUpdated: Dec 05, 2023\n\n7  min read\n\nCrypto  Casinos\n\nCasinos For 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦 Players\n\nThe debate on who is the greatest basketball player of all time never seems to be dying down. From the early days of the game, each generation raises new players who redefine the game.\n\nHis Airness, Michael Jordan, has reigned for three decades, but a lot has changed in the league since. Despite the two players being friendly, LeBron vs. Jordan debates are fierce among the fans.\n\nPeople who followed Jordan’s career in actual time believe he is the G.O.A.T. due to the competition he had, the stats that skyrocketed from his first season, and the six rings he gained in his six NBA finals.\n\nSome fans claim that King James came into the NBA just when things got more demanding. Among top players such as Kevin Durant, James Harden, Stephen Curry, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, and plenty more, LeBron managed to stand out as one of the best overall players to ever play in the league. In 2022, Forbes announced that Lebron James is the first person to become a billionaire while being an active NBA player.\n\nSo, how can we rank these two titans side by side? Since there is no way to see them go head to head while in their primes, it’s safe to say we might never have a universal agreement on the G.O.A.T of basketball.\n\nHowever, we can analyze the statistics, look at the challenges, accomplishments, and legacy, and provide you with something more to ponder.\n\nThe Background\n\nMichael Jordan joined the NBA in 1984 as the third overall pick for the Chicago Bulls. In his first year, Jordan led the Bulls to the playoffs. He also made the All-Rookie team, gained the Rookie of the Year Award and the All-Star status, and was on the All-NBA Second Team.\n\nHe won his first three rings with the Bulls, retired, played a bit of baseball, came back, and won three more rings before retiring again, only to come back for two more seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nWatching the games of Michael Jordan, LeBron James grew up idolizing his older counterpart. Upon joining the NBA, he analyzed Jordan’s game style, wore Air Jordans, and even chose the iconic number 23 for his jersey.\n\nOver time, LeBron developed his own style of play that decidedly differs from Jordan’s. LeBron is not as aggressive and is more comfortable with playing in a team, showcased by his exceptional leadership.\n\nTo get closer to determining who the actual NBA G.O.A.T. is, we must look at the results and the circumstances that led to them.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: Career Stats\n\nMichael Jordan played in the NBA for a total of 15 seasons, but some fans count only 13 seasons he played for the Bulls as this is where he delivered his best results. He took a hiatus twice but returned both times after a while. If we were to look at the statistics of both players’ first 13 seasons, Jordan would come out on top.\n\nWe’ve provided a list of average points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks per game in all of Jordan’s and LeBron’s first 13 seasons:\n\n | Michael Jordan | LeBron James\nPPG | 30.6 | 27.1\nRPG | 6.1 | 7.1\nAPG | 5.2 | 6.9\nSPG | 2.4 | 1.7\nBPG | 0.9 | 0.8\nLeBron, when compared to Jordan, is a better rebounder and much better with assists. This confirms that he is better at playing in a team and using his team’s strengths to his advantage.\n\nJordan, on the other hand, was a significantly better scorer, holding several records in that area of play. Furthermore, you never knew when or where he might pop up to steal the ball. In terms of blocking, Jordan was slightly better, just enough to give him the upper hand.\n\nJordan’s fans might choose to stop here and crown him the G.O.A.T. However, there are more in-depth stats worth looking at in the first 13 seasons:\n\n | Michael Jordan | LeBron James\nField Goal Percentage | 49.7 | 50.4\nThree-point Field Goal Percentage | 32.7 | 34.5\nFree-Throw Percentage | 83.5 | 73.4\nPlayer Efficiency Rating | 27.9 | 27.4\nTurnovers Per Game | 2.7 | 3.5\nLeBron is better than MJ as a three-pointer and is more likely to score regardless of where he is on the field.\n\nIn addition, LeBron is very good with assists, so it’s only natural for him to play as a part of the team. On the contrary, Jordan was often the one to show off while being double- or even triple-teamed, which may have crippled his statistics.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: Clutch Stats\n\nThe ability to take the lead and carry your team to victory is another characteristic of a great player. Helping the team through when in the clutch may just be what separates the champions from other players.\n\nPlenty of fans who witnessed Jordan’s rule will tell you that he is one of the most clutch players to ever play the game. His will to win was so compulsive that it became common to keep the focus on him as the game was coming to an end. Another thing that makes Jordan the G.O.A.T. is that he almost always takes it upon himself to win the game.\n\nWithin the first ten seasons of their careers, Jordan was 6-of-10 (60%) in the clutch in the postseason, while James was 7-of-16 (43.8%).\n\nLeBron’s clutch stats were still well above the league’s average for that year. The NBA average on clutch shots in 2013 was 28.3%, putting LeBron at 15.5% points above.\n\nThroughout his career, Jordan’s stats show a 50% success rate in clutch shots, while LeBron, for now, has a 29.6%. LeBron is in his 19th season and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nIt’s easy to say Lebron has no “clutch gene” looking at the success rate of his shots in the closing minutes of the game. Still, his overall performance does push the whole team forward, making it less likely for the team to need to be rescued.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: Playoff Stats\n\n | Michael Jordan | LeBron James\nPPG | 33.4 | 28.7\nRPG | 6.4 | 9.0\nAPG | 5.7 | 7.2\nSPG | 2.1 | 1.7\nBPG | 0.9 | 0.9\nLeBron’s field goal percentage stands at 49.6%, with 33.5% being from beyond the arc. Jordan, however, had a field goal percentage of 48.7% and 33.2% outside the three-point line.\n\nLeBron vs. Jordan: Finals’ Stats\n\nJordan has played 35 game-finals. LeBron has, up until now, played 55. We can compare the overall result and include all 90 games, but it might not be fair as LeBron’s stats change with the additional 20 games. If you are still interested in seeing that comparison, you can check it out here.\n\nWhen comparing each player’s first 35 games, the stats are as follows:\n\nMichael Jordan | Stats: | LeBron James\n33.6 | PPG | 26.1\n6.0 | RPG | 9.6\n6.0 | APG | 7.0\n1.8 | SPG | 1.8\n0.7 | BPG | 0.6\n2.8 | TPG | 3.9\n48.1 | FG% | 44.4\n36.8 | 3P% | 33.0\n80.6 | FT% | 74.4\nJordan seems to be a better all-around player, solidifying his position as the basketball G.O.A.T. When looking at the 35 games played in the finals, Michael Jordan’s stats are not significantly better than LeBron’s.\n\nSince LeBron is still active, his numbers keep improving, and it would be unfair to compare those stats with Jordan’s since Jordan’s career has ended.\n\nWhy Is LeBron Better Than MJ?\n\nLeBron is a better shooter from two- and three-point range and undoubtedly a much better passer and rebounder than Jordan, especially during the playoffs and the finals.\n\nCompared to Michael Jordan, LeBron James plays in a more challenging league. When Jordan was still playing, at least six teams were still in the growing phase and weren’t as much of a competition as they are now.\n\nLeBron was and is surrounded by a lot more talented teammates, people who are superstars in their own right. We’re talking about members of the All-Star teams and players introduced to the Hall of Fame: players such as Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wayde, Kyrie Irving, and Russell Westbrook.\n\nLeBron also played and won against some of the greatest names to play the game. He’s been head-to-head with Allen Iverson, Vince Carter, Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett, and pre-injury Derrick Rose.\n\nWhy Is Jordan Better Than LeBron?\n\nJordan is, without a doubt, a better scorer than LeBron, a fact that is more notable in the playoffs than during the regular season. He has a slight advantage over LeBron in terms of steals and blocks and is a far better scorer from the free-throw line.\n\nIt’s often said that Jordan played in a weaker league than LeBron. However, Jordan shared his time in the NBA with names like Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O’Neal, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Charles Barkley.\n\nJordan also spent almost an entire career with one team, wearing a Chicago Bulls jersey for 13 seasons.\n\nOn the other hand, many are slandering LeBron for switching teams as often as he did. NBA fans are known to blame LeBron for searching for a team to win championships instead of building one, which significantly adds to the G.O.A.T. debate.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls from the Jordan era are considered one of the greatest teams in NBA history. In the season of 1995/1996, the Bulls held a win/loss record of 72-10. It was such a dominant score that it took 20 years for the Golden State Warriors to set a new one with 73-9.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake – Jordan collected more career accolades than LeBron in their first 13 seasons. A lot more.\n\nMichael Jordan | LeBron James | Advantage\n84-85 Rookie of the Year | 03-04 Rookie of the Year | Equal\n9 x All-Defensive Player (87-88 Defensive Player of the Year) | 6 x All-Defensive Player | Jordan\n14 x All-Star | 12 x All-Star | Jordan\n3 x NBA All-Star Game MVP | 3 x NBA All-Star Game MVP | Equal\n11 x All-NBA Team | 12 x All-NBA Team | James\n5 x MVP | 4 x MVP | Jordan\n6 x NBA Finals MVP | 3 x NBA Finals MVP | Jordan\n2 x NBA Slam-Dunk Contest Champion | / | Jordan\n10 x NBA Scoring Leader | 1 x NBA Scoring Leader | Jordan\n/ | 1 x NBA Assist Leader | James\n6x NBA Champion (6-0 Finals Record) | 4x NBA Champion (4-6 Finals Record) | Jordan\nMember of the NBA Hall of Fame | Member of the NBA Hall of Fame | Equal\nIn the later season of his career, LeBron made the All-Star team six more times, the All-NBA team 5 more times, and acquired one more Finals MVP award.\n\nWho is Better: Michael Jordan or LeBron James?\n\nSo finally, who is better – LeBron or Jordan? If we consider Lebron’s whole career, he is statistically a better player. LeBron is on the same level Jordan was in his prime, but LeBron’s prime seems to last longer, a fact we can only be thankful for as it allows us to observe how the game and players have evolved.\n\nLeBron is, by far, the greatest player of his time, but is he the greatest NBA player of all time? The answer may just depend on who you ask. Some people believe LeBron James is the G.O.A.T., while others stand by Michael Jordan.\n\nWhether your answer is Jordan or LeBron, it’s up to each fan to decide who they think is best at the end of the day.\n\nFAQ\n\nMichael Jordan is still considered by many to be the greatest basketball player ever. Apart from many awards and accomplishments, his style of play and the drive to win were unprecedented.\n\nThe LeBron vs. Jordan debate is still ongoing, and it is still possible for James to take the crown.\n\nLeBron James has won four NBA championships – twice with Miami Heat, once with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and once with the LA Lakers.\n\nMichael Jordan won the NBA championships six times with the Chicago Bulls. He managed to do it in two three-peats with a hiatus in between.\n\nAs of 2022, LeBron has surpassed Michael Jordan as the all-time leading scorer counting the playoffs and has already surpassed Jordan in the regular season statistics, setting himself only behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nA driven content specialist and copywriter, Nemanja takes pride in the fact that he was among the first to find success as a content writer in his hometown of Nis, Serbia.
