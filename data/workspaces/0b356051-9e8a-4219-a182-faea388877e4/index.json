            "raw_content": "What's LeBron James' record in the NBA Finals? Comparing superstar forward's finals record to Michael Jordan\n\nLeBron James has had a remarkable career so far, showing great longevity as he enters his 20th season in the NBA. James made his first playoff appearance during the 2005-06 season as a Cavalier.\n\nBack then, the Cleveland Cavaliers finished the regular season with a respectable 61% winning record. However, James’ playoff run was cut short, losing 4-3 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nJames came out hungry the following season, getting his revenge on the Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals. He averaged 25.7 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 8.5 assists over six games, including a 48-point performance in Game 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers won the series in six games but were swept by the fundamentalists – the San Antonio Spurs – in the 2007 NBA Finals.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James’ four subsequent NBA Finals appearances came during his stint with the Miami Heat. Teaming up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami, James was in the NBA Finals again. However, the Dallas Mavericks came out on top in the 2011 Finals.\n\nJames was a dominant force in the following two seasons, leading his team in scoring, rebounds, and assists – in both the finals. The Miami Heat were crowned champions in 2012 & 2013, with James winning the Finals MVP in both editions.\n\nJames’ return to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014 sparked a new NBA Finals rivalry between them and the Golden State Warriors. They matched up in the NBA finals for four consecutive years, with LeBron James being crowned champion only once. After being swept by the Warriors in the 2018 NBA Finals, James took his services to the LA Lakers.\n\nLeBron's stint with the LA Lakers has been turbulent to say the least, given he’s made the playoffs in only two of his four seasons. Still, James did guide the Lakers to the championship in 2020.\n\nLeBron James’ NBA Finals record vs Michael Jordan’s\n\nCollectively, James has been in 10 NBA Finals, coming out victorious in four. He won the Finals MVP in all those editions, matching up as closely with his idol, Michael Jordan, as he could. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, has reached the NBA Finals just six times in his 15 seasons.\n\nHowever, Michael Jordan’s record in the NBA Finals is what sets him apart. Like James, Jordan was the top-performer in all his championship runs – earning the Finals MVP award in all six editions.\n\nBut Jordan was able to win the title in all six appearances – completing two three-peats. James’ winning percentage (40%) in the NBA Finals, taking nothing away from his efforts, will always be brought up in any comparison with Jordan.\n\nAkhil Khatri\n\nUltimate Frisbee and Basketball player.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan: Comparing Career Scoring Totals\n\nMitch Goldich | Mar 7, 2019\n\nLeBron James scored 31 points Wednesday in the Lakers' 115-99 loss to the Nuggets. It would likely go down as a forgettable result in a season heâd like to forget, save for one major news item: He passed Michael Jordan on the NBAâs all-time career scoring list.\n\nAs his 16th season winds down, LeBron has now racked up 32,311 points, even more than the 32,292 points MJ tallied in his 15 regular seasons. LeBron is now fourth all-time in scoring, trailing just Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant.\n\nSo today is the day. I will personally make the case that determines which of these two players is better and we will all agree forever. OK, probably not. There are other places on the internet to read those kinds of takes today. Instead Iâll just present some graphs and charts to compare the scoring outputs from these two all-time greats.\n\n1. Total points by age\n\nHere are their career points scored, broken down by age. In this case age means their n-age season, basically the year they were n years old on February 1, which is the way Basketball-Reference displays ages.\n\nHere you can see the advantage LeBron gained by jumping to the league straight out of high school, as he banked 3,700 points at the same ages that had Jordan wearing Carolina blue.\n\nThen you can see MJ gaining on LeBron until his baseball years (outside of his second season, when he only played 18 games in 1985-86).\n\nNow at 34, LeBron is the same age Jordan was when he finished his Bulls career with a second three-peat.\n\n2. Total points by season\n\nThis graph is similar to the one above, but now we go by season instead of age. This takes out the advantage LeBron gets from starting younger and playing all the way through. Jordanâs trajectory is no longer stunted by taking the 1993-94 season off, though you can still see the 1995 year when he played just 17 games in his return from baseball.\n\nBy this measure, Jordan was ahead of LeBron when he hung them up after his Wizards stint.\n\n3. Points per game by age4. Points per game by season\n\nThese two graphs are the same as the first two, but instead of using cumulative career points, weâll use scoring average per game during those seasons.\n\nAgain, when Jordan isnât dinged for the seasons he missed, you can see that his scoring average per season was consistently higher for most of his career.\n\nThatâs true either way you break it down, although his scoring averages as a 38- and 39-year-old in Washington, his 14th and 15th seasons, show a noticeable dip.\n\n5. Breaking down field goals, free throws and three-pointers\n\nThese pie charts basically answer the question: How did they get their points? It shows the career breakdowns for both players, and the percentage of points that came from free throws, two-point field goals and three-pointers.\n\nTheir free throw output is very close; Jordan made 7,327 and LeBron has made 7,101.\n\nThe key difference is three-point shooting. James has made 1,714 three pointers, while Jordan made just 581. Of course thatâs a result of them being products of their era. Jordan was a career 32.7% three-point shooter, while James has made a slightly better 34.4%. If Jordan played today, three-point shooting would likely be a bigger emphasis of his gameâmore attempts and he probably would have gotten even better at it.\n\n6. Breaking down points by team\n\nOne of the key differences between their careers is that Jordan spent almost all of his with the Bulls, until his late run with the Wizards. Jordanâs most famous employer swap was from the Bulls to the Birmingham Barons and back, whereas LeBron left Cleveland for Miami, came back and then again moved to Los Angeles.\n\nThis graph simply shows how many points they scored in each of their NBA uniforms.\n\n7. Breaking down points by career stop\n\nIf youâd like to take the previous graph and break it down further, this time weâll consider each of LeBronâs stops in Cleveland separately. And while weâre at it, we can carve out Jordanâs pre-baseball and post-baseball eras in Chicago.\n\nHereâs their total output during each of the various chapters in their careers.\n\n8. Scoring leader race by season\n\nIn addition to scoring more per game and more per season relative to LeBron, one thing that stands out about Jordanâs career is the way that he dominated his peers in the scoring race.\n\nJordan led the NBA in total points 11 times, including every season from 1986-87 through 1997-98 when he wasnât playing baseball.\n\nLeBron finished second in total points in eight straight seasons from 2004-05 through 2011-12, finishing behind Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant (3x), Dwyane Wade and Kevin Durant (3x). He didnât lead the league in total points until last season, his first time playing 82 games.\n\nThis graph shows where they finished in the league scoring (total points, not per game), based on the number of times finishing in each spot.Â  Jordan led the league 11 times, every season of his career except the two shortened Bulls seasons and the two Wizards seasons. LeBron only has that one season leading the league, but he was consistently in the Top 5. In fact, his first season in L.A. is his only time out of the Top 10, largely because of how many games he has missed due to injury.\n\nIf we used points per game to show where they stood among league leaders, the graph would look very similar. Jordanâs career scoring mark of 30.12 points per game is the all-time record, and MJ won the per game scoring title 10 times. LeBron's mark of 27.15 is fourth all-time, behind Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor. (For now at least. It takes three decimal places to separate James and Durant, and LeBron actually leapfrogged KD on Wednesday.)\n\nBut again, none of this is to say that Jordan was better than LeBron. Or vice versa. They each have different careers, different skills and different stories. It would be just as simplistic to boil their entire careers down to total points as it is to reduce their careers down to championship rings. They both deserve to be appreciated for what theyâve done, and on a day thatâs natural to compare their scoring output itâs fun to compare their careers in a few different ways.\n\nMitch Goldich is a senior editor for Sports Illustrated, mostly focused on the NFL.
