The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

So this group of Bulls stands as not only the best Bulls team of the Jordan era but the greatest team of all time.\n\nThey won 86.7 percent of all games they played, a ridiculous percentage that places them among the most dominant teams in any major U.S. pro sport. This was the fourth Bulls championship, earned in the first full season after Michael Jordan returned from his mid-90s “retirement.” They had winning streaks of 13 and 18 games and only once lost consecutive games, to the Nuggets and Suns on an early February trip West.\n\nThey won 14 of their first 15 games in the playoffs, and the loss to the Knicks came in overtime. Of the 15 postseason victories necessary to claim the NBA title, 10 came by double-digit margins.\n\n2. 1996-97\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nAlthough there is no question the 1996 team was superior, coming back a year later and nearly matching that performance might was, at its essence, even more impressive. Jordan and Pippen ranked among the top 20 in the league in minutes, even though each already had four championship rings. Toni Kukoc’s versatility off the bench continued to escalate. He ranked third on the team in shots and scoring and second in assists, behind Pippen. They opened the season with a 12-game winning streak, an amazing feat given this was a team that knew very well the championship was not going to be won in November.\n\n3. 1991-92\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the year of Jordan’s famous shrug, a gesture during Game 1 of the Finals series with the Blazers that underscored not only a moment, but an era. It was an acknowledgment that, indeed, even he could not believe he’d gotten so good. He earned 80 of a possible 96 first-place votes for MVP, 93.8 percent of a perfect score.\n\nCartwright missed 18 games because of injury but was back for a strong run in the playoffs, when he averaged 28 minutes, including a challenging matchup with Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing in which Ewing shot 8-of-19 from the field in the decisive game.\n\n4. 1990-91\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was not a strong year for the NBA overall, still absorbing the expansion by four teams in the previous three years. Detroit’s Bad Boys were showing wear and won only 50 games. The team with the best record in the league, the Trail Blazers, proved not ready for the spotlight and fell easily to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Bulls had to surmount mental hurdles to at last win a championship with Jordan on their side. Most notable among those was getting past the Pistons, but they also had to conquer a Lakers team accustomed to winning titles (but not used to doing it without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). John Paxson’s 44 percent shooting from 3-poit range and Horace Grant’s growth into a 34-minute player were essential to the breakthrough.\n\n5. 1997-98\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThe injury that kept Pippen out at the beginning of “The Last Dance” season led to him starting only 44 games to Kukoc’s 52. By the time they Bulls were back to the playoffs, they were again using the rotation similar to what worked so beautifully the previous two years, albeit with Kukoc frequently filling Rodman’s spot as a starter.\n\nEven with Pippen missing for so long, the controversy regarding the declaration by Bulls management that Jackson would not return the following season and the distraction of Jordan constantly being asked about his future plans, the team still managed to tie the Jazz for best record in the league. It was another example of Jordan and the Bulls demonstrating that when it would be easy to relax – explicable, even – they still discovered the motivation to push through toward greatness.\n\nThere never was a \"Super Bowl hangover\" with Jordan's Bulls. Their Finals series against Utah was the most competitive of the six title teams; five of the six games were decided by two or fewer possessions. The title was won on a Jordan step-back jumper that has become among the most iconic shots in the game’s history.\n\n6. 1992-93\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the only Bulls title team that didn’t reach the 60-win plateau, with the offense fading and more reliant on Jordan than at any point during the team’s championship run. Cartwright needed more help from Scott Williams to man the middle. They essentially split time at the center spot, and together they produced a double-figure rebound average.\n\nThere was a shaky moment in the conference finals against the blossoming Knicks, who rode the tough-guy front line Ewing, Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley to 60 victories and the No. 1 seed in the East. The Bulls lost the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, then blew out the Knicks in the next two games to remind them what they were facing in challenging this dynasty.\n\nThe closest the Bulls came to losing a championship arrived then, with each having won two games and the Bulls ahead by a point with 20 seconds remaining. Forward Charles Smith got the ball inside and had four attempts to make a game-winning layup, but all were challenged and/or blocked by Bulls defenders. That was it for the Knicks. No one ever came so close again to eliminating a full-strength Jordan/Bulls team.\n\nMike DeCourcy\n\nMike DeCourcy has been the college basketball columnist at The Sporting News since 1995.

He never even let it get to seven games - not even once, which is sick.\n\nWilt lost in the Finals numerous times, Russell lost in the 18=958 Finals, Bird lost in the Finals, Erving lost in the Finals, West lost in the Finals, Shaq lost in the Finals (2004) and Kobe lost in the Finals twice (2004 and 2008), Kareem lost in the Finals and Magic lost in the Finals, including against MJ himself.\n\nWhy is Jordan the greatest. His stats? Yep. 10 time scoring champion? Yep. Defensive Player of the Year? Yep. Five time NBA MVP? Yep. Perfection in the Finals with 6 MVP's? Yep and Yep.\n\nHere we see why no one can can in this guys rare air.\n\nMan you should'a seen this kids! Yo, this was straight sick. MJ went up against Magic and went out and busted through with four straight wins to take his first title.\n\nThe fabled Lakers couldn't hang with this one man. Don't even try the Pippen statement. Believe me, I was there dude. Pippen could do nothing on his own and he actually kinda sucked, except on defense. But Jordan was just dirty with it. He scored and passed better than Magic himself and averaged over 10 assists and 30 points. WTF?\n\nIn game one he scored 36 points had eight rebounds, 12 assists and three steals.\n\nIn game two he scored 33 points on 15/18 shooting, seven rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a block.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 29 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, four steals and two blocks.\n\nIn game four he scored 28 points, dished off for 13 assists and had five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nIn the closer MJ had 30 points, 10 assists and five steals.\n\nCan't hate on that. That is the GOAT right there.\n\n6'7\" Drexler was in his all-around prime and the Portlans team had way more options than Chicago who had uh....Michael Jordan.\n\nHe showed what was up in the first 24 minutes of the series. No one, even if they were bigger, heavier or stronger ever could or did stop him. Did they? Nope.\n\nIn game one he scored 39 points in 34 minutes and added 11 assists, but the six threes before halftime is the most exciting half in Finals history. 35 points at halftime is still a Finals record beeatches!\n\nIn game two MJ had 39 points and 10 assists.\n\nIn game three Jordan scored 26 and had seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 32 and added five rebounds and six assists.\n\nIn game five MJ went off on 14/23 from the field and 16/19 from the line and 2/3 from threes and schooled for 46 points.\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 33 points, had four steals, four rebounds and four assists and one block.\n\nTotally unstoppable man.\n\nAll MJ went out and did was record the highest scoring average in a Finals series ever with 41.0 ppg. Yep, let's see anyone in the league today be that dirty in the Finals. IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nJust put it this way: Game one 31 points, game two 42 points, game three 44 points, game four 55 points, game five 41 points and in the closer 33 points versus Barkley, Ainge, KJ, Chambers and Majerle.\n\nYes, that was FOUR STRAIGHT FINALS GAMES WITH OVER 40 POINTS. Get yourselves a reality check people. I saw every game MJ was obviously the best player in history and Pippen wasn't really that awesome in this series. Get it real: MJ is the only reason they won against a superior team.\n\nMan, this guy was greater at age 32-33 than any player ever. He had come out of retirement in 1995 and led the Bulls to a 13-4 record to finish the 1994-95 season but the Bulls didn't make it to the Finals. MJ was rusty really, after not playing for 18 months.\n\nSo he said to himself and his teammates - watch this!\n\nHe proceeded to lead his team to the greatest single season in NBA history with a 72-10 regular season record.\n\nIn game one of the Finals MJ scored 28 points and added seven rebounds.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 29 points and added six rebounds, eight assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 36 and had five assists and two steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 23 but the rest of the Bulls were actually on fire.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 26 points and added four rebounds.\n\nIn the closer MJ and the Bulls won so easily that MJ only needed to score 22, which is the least points he has ever scored in the Finals.\n\nPayton and Kemp could stop every one but not MJ.\n\nThe Bulls were led by 34 year old Michael to the second best record in NBA history with a 69-13 record. They have the top place too with 72-10. Over two season MJ led them to 141 wins and 23 loss record.\n\nMJ was there for every game and led the NBA in scoring both times, shooting 50%.\n\nIn game one of the Finals vs Stockton and Malone and Hornacek -  MJ scored 31 points and added eight assists.\n\nIn game two he scored 38 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three he scored 26 points and had six assists.\n\nIn game four MJ scored a game high for either team with 22 points.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 38 points (he was sick that day too).\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 39 points and added 11 rebounds.\n\nMan, this dude was 34 and schooling these guys still. Jordan will not be topped we was that freaking great.\n\nAt age 35 MJ became the oldest MVP and scoring champion ever.\n\nHe also led the Bulls to a 62-20 record and took them to face Utah again.\n\nIn game one MJ had 33 points.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 37.\n\nIn game three he had 24 points in 32 minutes, because the Bulls were SO ahead.\n\nIn game four MJ scored 34 and added eight rebounds and two steals.\n\nIn game five Jordan scored 28 and had three steals.\n\nIn his last ever Finals game (cuz he retired again after this one) Jordan scored 45 points! One of his four steals led to him hitting the greatest and most famous and momentous last shot of a Finals series ever.\n\nThey way he held his hand in the air was so cool. No one left has such style.\n\nThere are over 100 reasons I can think of to explain how MJ is the greatest player who cannot be passed, especially by any player in the NBA today, but the whole point of this story is to show one thing.\n\nYes, there are player of great will and desire like Kobe, but Kobe lost in the Finals in 2004 and 2008. If Jordan was on the 2004 Lakers they would have won for damn sure. The 2004 Pistons would get stomped by the 1991 Pistons and the Lakers lost to them 4-1.\n\nKobe didn't do anything to make them win (and he had Malone, Shaq and Payton on his team so there's no excuse for losing), so he aint even in the conversation. In 2008 the Lakers lost even though they had Gasol. MJ never had a center worth much, but he never lost anyway.\n\nPut prime Jordan on the 2008 Lakers and they'd be champs for sure. You know how I know? MJ NEVER ONCE LOST IN THE FNALS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat is why Jordan is the greatest ever: they all lost and he didn't.\n\nLebron? Nope.\n\nWade? Nope.\n\nCarmelo? Nope.\n\nHoward? Nope.\n\nRose? Nope.\n\nDurant? Nope.\n\nKobe? Nope.\n\nMJ is the GOAT and you must accept it in order to be happy.\n\n"

Of those 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls for 13 (1984-93; 1995-98) and the Washington Wizards for a couple (2001-03).\n\nWhile he did record remarkable numbers for a player closer to 40 than 35, he was clearly in the twilight of his career with the WIzards. His greatest years came with the Bulls, predominantly in the 1990s when he led the franchise to six championships in as many Finals appearances over eight years.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at when Jordan won each of his six NBA titles, the numbers he put up in those seasons and the teams he beat en route to those championships:\n\n1991\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1991 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 31.5 points (1st in NBA), 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.7 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a conference-best 61-21 regular-season record (2nd in NBA). In the playoffs, Jordan averaged 31.1 points, 8.4 assists, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals as the Bulls dropped just two games en route to their first-ever title, with both losses only coming by two points.\n\nThe most iconic moment of this championship series came in Game 2 when Jordan pulled 'the spectacular move' by switching from a dunk to a left-handed layup mid-air:\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1992 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 30.1 points (1st in NBA), 6.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a league-best 67-15 record. It was the first time in franchise history that the Bulls had recorded the league's best regular-season record.\n\nIn the playoffs, this time around, the Bulls faced a lot more competition. Dropping seven games in the 1992 postseason, Jordan led the Bulls with playoff averages of 34.5 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.0 steals. With this title, the Bulls, at that time, became only the third franchise after the Lakers and the Celtics to win back-to-back championships.\n\nMORE: How Jordan dominated Drexler in the 1992 Finals\n\nWhile there were plenty of other notable 'Jordan' moments in this postseason run, including a 54-point Game 4 performance against the Knicks, arguably the most memorable is the Shrug Game - Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n#OTD: The Shrug GameMichael Jordan sets #NBAFinals record for points (35) & threes (6) in a half in Game 1 of the 1992 #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/C73Gs4T8hQ\n\n1993\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1993 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 32.6 points (1st in NBA), 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals (1st in NBA), Jordan led the Bulls to a 57-25 record (3rd in NBA).\n\nIn the quest to become only the second franchise since the Celtics of the 1960s to win three straight titles, Jordan averaged a playoff career-high 35.1 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.1 steals.\n\nDuring the 1993 postseason, he recorded two 50-point games including a 55-point masterpiece in Game 4 of the Finals:\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1996 NBA Championship:\n\nPlaying his first full season since 1993, when he led the Bulls to a 3-peat, Jordan averaged 30.4 points (1st in NBA), 6.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals. He led the Bulls to a league-best 72-10, then an NBA record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\n\nIn the postseason, Jordan averaged 30.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.8 steals as the Bulls dropped just one game en route to the Finals. In the championship series, they quickly jumped to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and SuperSonics. While Sonics retaliated and won two straight, Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\n1997\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1997 NBA Championship:\n\nFor the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as he played all 82 games. Coming off the NBA record 72 wins, the Bulls finished with a league-best 69-13 record.\n\nJust like the regular season, the Bulls breezed past the East in the playoffs and were set to face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. In the extremely competitive series, that saw an average winning margin of just six points, the defending champions came out on top.\n\n\n\nJordan averaged 31.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 steals in the playoffs. More notably, in the Finals - Game 5 to be precise - he had one of the most iconic and memorable games of his career - 'The Flu Game'.\n\n\n\nBattling the Flu, Jordan finished with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 44 minutes on the court.\n\n1998\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1998 NBA Championship:\n\nComing off 72 and 69 wins in the previous two years, the Bulls kept the momentum rolling. They tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best record of 62-20 as Jordan averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists while playing all 82 games.\n\nThe Bulls cruised past the first two rounds but in the Conference Finals, just for the second time in the Bulls championship seasons, they were taken to a Game 7 by the Indiana Pacers. After narrowly beating them, they were set for a rematch with the Jazz but this contest ended in six games as well.\n\nMORE: The most underappreciated play of MJ's career\n\nJordan ended his Bulls career with one of the best sequences of his career - a steal on Malone followed by the game-winner over Byron Russell.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nYash Matange\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\nPartners\n\n"
