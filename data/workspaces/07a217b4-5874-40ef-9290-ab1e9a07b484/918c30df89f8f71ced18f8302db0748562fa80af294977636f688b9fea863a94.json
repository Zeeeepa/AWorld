The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

So this group of Bulls stands as not only the best Bulls team of the Jordan era but the greatest team of all time.\n\nThey won 86.7 percent of all games they played, a ridiculous percentage that places them among the most dominant teams in any major U.S. pro sport. This was the fourth Bulls championship, earned in the first full season after Michael Jordan returned from his mid-90s “retirement.” They had winning streaks of 13 and 18 games and only once lost consecutive games, to the Nuggets and Suns on an early February trip West.\n\nThey won 14 of their first 15 games in the playoffs, and the loss to the Knicks came in overtime. Of the 15 postseason victories necessary to claim the NBA title, 10 came by double-digit margins.\n\n2. 1996-97\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nAlthough there is no question the 1996 team was superior, coming back a year later and nearly matching that performance might was, at its essence, even more impressive. Jordan and Pippen ranked among the top 20 in the league in minutes, even though each already had four championship rings. Toni Kukoc’s versatility off the bench continued to escalate. He ranked third on the team in shots and scoring and second in assists, behind Pippen. They opened the season with a 12-game winning streak, an amazing feat given this was a team that knew very well the championship was not going to be won in November.\n\n3. 1991-92\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the year of Jordan’s famous shrug, a gesture during Game 1 of the Finals series with the Blazers that underscored not only a moment, but an era. It was an acknowledgment that, indeed, even he could not believe he’d gotten so good. He earned 80 of a possible 96 first-place votes for MVP, 93.8 percent of a perfect score.\n\nCartwright missed 18 games because of injury but was back for a strong run in the playoffs, when he averaged 28 minutes, including a challenging matchup with Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing in which Ewing shot 8-of-19 from the field in the decisive game.\n\n4. 1990-91\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was not a strong year for the NBA overall, still absorbing the expansion by four teams in the previous three years. Detroit’s Bad Boys were showing wear and won only 50 games. The team with the best record in the league, the Trail Blazers, proved not ready for the spotlight and fell easily to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Bulls had to surmount mental hurdles to at last win a championship with Jordan on their side. Most notable among those was getting past the Pistons, but they also had to conquer a Lakers team accustomed to winning titles (but not used to doing it without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). John Paxson’s 44 percent shooting from 3-poit range and Horace Grant’s growth into a 34-minute player were essential to the breakthrough.\n\n5. 1997-98\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThe injury that kept Pippen out at the beginning of “The Last Dance” season led to him starting only 44 games to Kukoc’s 52. By the time they Bulls were back to the playoffs, they were again using the rotation similar to what worked so beautifully the previous two years, albeit with Kukoc frequently filling Rodman’s spot as a starter.\n\nEven with Pippen missing for so long, the controversy regarding the declaration by Bulls management that Jackson would not return the following season and the distraction of Jordan constantly being asked about his future plans, the team still managed to tie the Jazz for best record in the league. It was another example of Jordan and the Bulls demonstrating that when it would be easy to relax – explicable, even – they still discovered the motivation to push through toward greatness.\n\nThere never was a \"Super Bowl hangover\" with Jordan's Bulls. Their Finals series against Utah was the most competitive of the six title teams; five of the six games were decided by two or fewer possessions. The title was won on a Jordan step-back jumper that has become among the most iconic shots in the game’s history.\n\n6. 1992-93\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the only Bulls title team that didn’t reach the 60-win plateau, with the offense fading and more reliant on Jordan than at any point during the team’s championship run. Cartwright needed more help from Scott Williams to man the middle. They essentially split time at the center spot, and together they produced a double-figure rebound average.\n\nThere was a shaky moment in the conference finals against the blossoming Knicks, who rode the tough-guy front line Ewing, Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley to 60 victories and the No. 1 seed in the East. The Bulls lost the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, then blew out the Knicks in the next two games to remind them what they were facing in challenging this dynasty.\n\nThe closest the Bulls came to losing a championship arrived then, with each having won two games and the Bulls ahead by a point with 20 seconds remaining. Forward Charles Smith got the ball inside and had four attempts to make a game-winning layup, but all were challenged and/or blocked by Bulls defenders. That was it for the Knicks. No one ever came so close again to eliminating a full-strength Jordan/Bulls team.\n\nMike DeCourcy\n\nMike DeCourcy has been the college basketball columnist at The Sporting News since 1995.

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nMichael Jordan: Why He's a 6-Time Finals MVP, 6-for-6 Champion and G.O.A.T.\n\nMichael Jordan is the only player in NBA history to never score less than 20 points in any of his Finals games but that is just one reason that every time the greatest player ever never once let his team lose in the Finals and was named Finals MVP all six times.\n\nThe truth is that although he did record the best Finals and playoff stats of any player ever it was that he was never a sidekick and he took control of every single Finals game he played in and JUST ABSOLUTELY REFUSED to let his team lose a Finals series, which no one else can really say (Duncan is 4 for 4). He never even let it get to seven games - not even once, which is sick.\n\nWilt lost in the Finals numerous times, Russell lost in the 18=958 Finals, Bird lost in the Finals, Erving lost in the Finals, West lost in the Finals, Shaq lost in the Finals (2004) and Kobe lost in the Finals twice (2004 and 2008), Kareem lost in the Finals and Magic lost in the Finals, including against MJ himself.\n\nWhy is Jordan the greatest. His stats? Yep. 10 time scoring champion? Yep. Defensive Player of the Year? Yep. Five time NBA MVP? Yep. Perfection in the Finals with 6 MVP's? Yep and Yep.\n\nHere we see why no one can can in this guys rare air.\n\nMan you should'a seen this kids! Yo, this was straight sick. MJ went up against Magic and went out and busted through with four straight wins to take his first title.\n\nThe fabled Lakers couldn't hang with this one man. Don't even try the Pippen statement. Believe me, I was there dude. Pippen could do nothing on his own and he actually kinda sucked, except on defense. But Jordan was just dirty with it. He scored and passed better than Magic himself and averaged over 10 assists and 30 points. WTF?\n\nIn game one he scored 36 points had eight rebounds, 12 assists and three steals.\n\nIn game two he scored 33 points on 15/18 shooting, seven rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a block.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 29 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, four steals and two blocks.\n\nIn game four he scored 28 points, dished off for 13 assists and had five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nIn the closer MJ had 30 points, 10 assists and five steals.\n\nCan't hate on that. That is the GOAT right there.\n\n6'7\" Drexler was in his all-around prime and the Portlans team had way more options than Chicago who had uh....Michael Jordan.\n\nHe showed what was up in the first 24 minutes of the series. No one, even if they were bigger, heavier or stronger ever could or did stop him. Did they? Nope.\n\nIn game one he scored 39 points in 34 minutes and added 11 assists, but the six threes before halftime is the most exciting half in Finals history. 35 points at halftime is still a Finals record beeatches!\n\nIn game two MJ had 39 points and 10 assists.\n\nIn game three Jordan scored 26 and had seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 32 and added five rebounds and six assists.\n\nIn game five MJ went off on 14/23 from the field and 16/19 from the line and 2/3 from threes and schooled for 46 points.\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 33 points, had four steals, four rebounds and four assists and one block.\n\nTotally unstoppable man.\n\nAll MJ went out and did was record the highest scoring average in a Finals series ever with 41.0 ppg. Yep, let's see anyone in the league today be that dirty in the Finals. IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nJust put it this way: Game one 31 points, game two 42 points, game three 44 points, game four 55 points, game five 41 points and in the closer 33 points versus Barkley, Ainge, KJ, Chambers and Majerle.\n\nYes, that was FOUR STRAIGHT FINALS GAMES WITH OVER 40 POINTS. Get yourselves a reality check people. I saw every game MJ was obviously the best player in history and Pippen wasn't really that awesome in this series. Get it real: MJ is the only reason they won against a superior team.\n\nMan, this guy was greater at age 32-33 than any player ever. He had come out of retirement in 1995 and led the Bulls to a 13-4 record to finish the 1994-95 season but the Bulls didn't make it to the Finals. MJ was rusty really, after not playing for 18 months.\n\nSo he said to himself and his teammates - watch this!\n\nHe proceeded to lead his team to the greatest single season in NBA history with a 72-10 regular season record.\n\nIn game one of the Finals MJ scored 28 points and added seven rebounds.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 29 points and added six rebounds, eight assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 36 and had five assists and two steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 23 but the rest of the Bulls were actually on fire.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 26 points and added four rebounds.\n\nIn the closer MJ and the Bulls won so easily that MJ only needed to score 22, which is the least points he has ever scored in the Finals.\n\nPayton and Kemp could stop every one but not MJ.\n\nThe Bulls were led by 34 year old Michael to the second best record in NBA history with a 69-13 record. They have the top place too with 72-10. Over two season MJ led them to 141 wins and 23 loss record.\n\nMJ was there for every game and led the NBA in scoring both times, shooting 50%.\n\nIn game one of the Finals vs Stockton and Malone and Hornacek -  MJ scored 31 points and added eight assists.\n\nIn game two he scored 38 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three he scored 26 points and had six assists.\n\nIn game four MJ scored a game high for either team with 22 points.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 38 points (he was sick that day too).\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 39 points and added 11 rebounds.\n\nMan, this dude was 34 and schooling these guys still. Jordan will not be topped we was that freaking great.\n\nAt age 35 MJ became the oldest MVP and scoring champion ever.\n\nHe also led the Bulls to a 62-20 record and took them to face Utah again.\n\nIn game one MJ had 33 points.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 37.\n\nIn game three he had 24 points in 32 minutes, because the Bulls were SO ahead.\n\nIn game four MJ scored 34 and added eight rebounds and two steals.\n\nIn game five Jordan scored 28 and had three steals.\n\nIn his last ever Finals game (cuz he retired again after this one) Jordan scored 45 points! One of his four steals led to him hitting the greatest and most famous and momentous last shot of a Finals series ever.\n\nThey way he held his hand in the air was so cool. No one left has such style.\n\nThere are over 100 reasons I can think of to explain how MJ is the greatest player who cannot be passed, especially by any player in the NBA today, but the whole point of this story is to show one thing.\n\nYes, there are player of great will and desire like Kobe, but Kobe lost in the Finals in 2004 and 2008. If Jordan was on the 2004 Lakers they would have won for damn sure. The 2004 Pistons would get stomped by the 1991 Pistons and the Lakers lost to them 4-1.\n\nKobe didn't do anything to make them win (and he had Malone, Shaq and Payton on his team so there's no excuse for losing), so he aint even in the conversation. In 2008 the Lakers lost even though they had Gasol. MJ never had a center worth much, but he never lost anyway.\n\nPut prime Jordan on the 2008 Lakers and they'd be champs for sure. You know how I know? MJ NEVER ONCE LOST IN THE FNALS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat is why Jordan is the greatest ever: they all lost and he didn't.\n\nLebron? Nope.\n\nWade? Nope.\n\nCarmelo? Nope.\n\nHoward? Nope.\n\nRose? Nope.\n\nDurant? Nope.\n\nKobe? Nope.\n\nMJ is the GOAT and you must accept it in order to be happy.\n\n"

Of those 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls for 13 (1984-93; 1995-98) and the Washington Wizards for a couple (2001-03).\n\nWhile he did record remarkable numbers for a player closer to 40 than 35, he was clearly in the twilight of his career with the WIzards. His greatest years came with the Bulls, predominantly in the 1990s when he led the franchise to six championships in as many Finals appearances over eight years.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at when Jordan won each of his six NBA titles, the numbers he put up in those seasons and the teams he beat en route to those championships:\n\n1991\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1991 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 31.5 points (1st in NBA), 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.7 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a conference-best 61-21 regular-season record (2nd in NBA). In the playoffs, Jordan averaged 31.1 points, 8.4 assists, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals as the Bulls dropped just two games en route to their first-ever title, with both losses only coming by two points.\n\nThe most iconic moment of this championship series came in Game 2 when Jordan pulled 'the spectacular move' by switching from a dunk to a left-handed layup mid-air:\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1992 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 30.1 points (1st in NBA), 6.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a league-best 67-15 record. It was the first time in franchise history that the Bulls had recorded the league's best regular-season record.\n\nIn the playoffs, this time around, the Bulls faced a lot more competition. Dropping seven games in the 1992 postseason, Jordan led the Bulls with playoff averages of 34.5 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.0 steals. With this title, the Bulls, at that time, became only the third franchise after the Lakers and the Celtics to win back-to-back championships.\n\nMORE: How Jordan dominated Drexler in the 1992 Finals\n\nWhile there were plenty of other notable 'Jordan' moments in this postseason run, including a 54-point Game 4 performance against the Knicks, arguably the most memorable is the Shrug Game - Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n#OTD: The Shrug GameMichael Jordan sets #NBAFinals record for points (35) & threes (6) in a half in Game 1 of the 1992 #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/C73Gs4T8hQ\n\n1993\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1993 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 32.6 points (1st in NBA), 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals (1st in NBA), Jordan led the Bulls to a 57-25 record (3rd in NBA).\n\nIn the quest to become only the second franchise since the Celtics of the 1960s to win three straight titles, Jordan averaged a playoff career-high 35.1 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.1 steals.\n\nDuring the 1993 postseason, he recorded two 50-point games including a 55-point masterpiece in Game 4 of the Finals:\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1996 NBA Championship:\n\nPlaying his first full season since 1993, when he led the Bulls to a 3-peat, Jordan averaged 30.4 points (1st in NBA), 6.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals. He led the Bulls to a league-best 72-10, then an NBA record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\n\nIn the postseason, Jordan averaged 30.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.8 steals as the Bulls dropped just one game en route to the Finals. In the championship series, they quickly jumped to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and SuperSonics. While Sonics retaliated and won two straight, Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\n1997\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1997 NBA Championship:\n\nFor the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as he played all 82 games. Coming off the NBA record 72 wins, the Bulls finished with a league-best 69-13 record.\n\nJust like the regular season, the Bulls breezed past the East in the playoffs and were set to face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. In the extremely competitive series, that saw an average winning margin of just six points, the defending champions came out on top.\n\n\n\nJordan averaged 31.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 steals in the playoffs. More notably, in the Finals - Game 5 to be precise - he had one of the most iconic and memorable games of his career - 'The Flu Game'.\n\n\n\nBattling the Flu, Jordan finished with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 44 minutes on the court.\n\n1998\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1998 NBA Championship:\n\nComing off 72 and 69 wins in the previous two years, the Bulls kept the momentum rolling. They tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best record of 62-20 as Jordan averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists while playing all 82 games.\n\nThe Bulls cruised past the first two rounds but in the Conference Finals, just for the second time in the Bulls championship seasons, they were taken to a Game 7 by the Indiana Pacers. After narrowly beating them, they were set for a rematch with the Jazz but this contest ended in six games as well.\n\nMORE: The most underappreciated play of MJ's career\n\nJordan ended his Bulls career with one of the best sequences of his career - a steal on Malone followed by the game-winner over Byron Russell.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nYash Matange\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\nPartners\n\n"

          "raw_content": "NBA Champions by Year: Complete History and Results of the NBA Finals\n\nJoe Lago | Apr 7, 2025\n\nBasketball's most cherished records are set in the regular season, but the playoffs is where lasting legacies are created.\n\nEach National Basketball Association season culminates in the NBA Finals, which determine the season's champion between the winners of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference. The best-of-seven game series finale also serves as the stage for players and teams to carve their places in hoops history.\n\nThe Origins of the NBA Finals\n\nThe NBA recognizes its first champion as the winner of the six-team Basketball Association of America, which began in 1947. The Philadelphia Warriors defeated the Chicago Staggs 4-1 and clinched the title behind Hall of Famer Joe Fulks, who scored 21 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5.\n\nThe Finals format of determining a champion in a first-to-four-victories series was modeled after Major League Baseball's World Series, which was the brainchild of John T. Brush. The New York Giants principal owner proposed a best-of-seven games contest between the American League and National League champs, and the \"Brush Rules\" were adopted in February 1905.\n\nThe BAA played its games in major venues, such as Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium, but the best players competed in the National Basketball League. After the NBL's four best teams joined the BAA before the 1948-49 season, the competitors merged in 1949 to create a new pro basketball leagueâthe NBA.\n\nWhen the NBA expanded from 10 to 12 teams in 1968, the basketball market in America had room for a new upstart league in the American Basketball Association. The ABA promoted a flashy, high-scoring brand of hoops, including the three-point shot, but in 1976, the league folded with four of its teams joining the NBA â Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEvery NBA Champion in History\n\nGeorge Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers won the first NBA Finals in 1950, defeating the Syracuse Nationals 4-2. The Lakers featured Hall of Famers in Mikan, Jim Pollard, Slater Martin and Vern Mikkelsen, and with the 6'10\" Mikan, they dominated defensively on their narrow home court at Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nMinneapolis would win three more NBA Finals before the league's defining dynasty took over.\n\nIn 1957, the Boston Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks 4-3 to capture their first-ever NBA championship. Under legendary coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won 10 more league crowns over the next 12 seasons. Bill Russell served as the inspirational leader and defensive anchor for all 11 title teams and is the record holder for most NBA championships by a player.\n\nThe Celtics enjoyed another run of success in the 1980s, but it coincided with the emergence of a new Lakers dynasty in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson rivalry that elevated college basketball to new heights had the same game-changing impact on the NBA. The two all-time greats faced off in some of the league's most memorable Finals battles and combined for eight championships in the 80sâJohnson outdueling Bird 5-3 in Larry O'Brien Trophy wins.\n\nMore dynasties would rule the NBA.\n\nIn the 1990s, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls achieved not one but two three-peats by winning three consecutive titles from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998. Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors ushered in a new era of prioritizing the three-pointer when they won the 2015 crown, the first of four championships in an eight-year period.\n\nThe Celtics have won the most NBA titles with 18, one more than the Lakers. The Warriors rank third with seven championships. The Bulls and Spurs have won six and five NBA crowns, respectively.\n\nYear | Winning Team | Losing Team | Series Result | Finals MVP\n1947 | Philadelphia Warriors | Chicago Stags | 4-1 | \n1948 |

in NBA Finals History\n\nThe NBA's all-time greats each have produced an iconic Finals moment that lives on in the memories of basketball fans and in perpetuity on YouTube. The most celebrated plays are the clutch shots that helped their teams secure the championship.\n\nArguably the most iconic shot in NBA history is Michael Jordan's 20-foot jumper that clinched the Bulls' 1998 title against the Utah Jazz. Expected to retire after the series, the 34-year-old Jordan scored on a layup to cut Chicago's deficit to one point, stole the ball from Karl Malone and then crossed over Bryon Russell to bury the go-ahead basket with 5.2 seconds left.\n\nJordan walked away from basketball (temporarily) after winning his sixth NBA championship.\n\nLeBron James, who shares the \"Greatest of All Time\" status with Jordan, has his own Finals highlight with the most historic display of championship-level defense for his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIn Game 7 of perhaps the greatest NBA Finals ever against the record-setting 73-win Warriors in 2016, James chased down Andre Iguodala to block his layup attempt and keep the score tied at 89 with less than two minutes remaining. Kyrie Irving's three-pointer with 53.0 seconds left gave the Cavaliers the lead for good as Cleveland completed a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nNBA Finals lore also features dominant one-man performances.\n\nMagic Johnson famously filled in for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals, and the 20-year-old rookie totaled 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists to lead the Lakers to a title-clinching 123-107 victory.\n\nOn one historic occasion, the mere presence of a player provided the inspiration to win the championship. That uplifting scenario took place in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals with New York Knicks center Willis Reed.\n\nReed wasn't expected to play the series finale against the Lakers after suffering a muscle tear in his right thigh, but he shocked his teammates when he walked onto the court for pregame warmups. The Madison Square Garden crowd greeted him with a standing ovation.\n\nReed summoned the will and energy to play \"on one leg\" while trying to defend Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks captain played 27 minutes and finished with only four points, well below his 21.7-point average, but New York rallied behind Walt Frazier's 36 points and 19 assists to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\nLow TV ratings relegated the NBA Finals to be broadcast on tape delay in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, viewers who tuned in to Game 5 of the 1976 Finals were treated to an epic three-overtime battle between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe craziest sequence took place at the end of the second OT when John Havlicek banked in a 15-foot shot for what appeared to be the game-winner. One second was still on the clock, and it was more than enough time for Garfield Heard to sink a 20-foot turnaround jumper to force a third overtime.\n\nBoston eventually would win 128-126 to take a 3-2 series lead en route to the franchise's 13th NBA crown.\n\nEvolution of the NBA Finals Format\n\nIn 1985, the NBA changed its Finals format from 2-2-1-1-1âplaying consecutive games on each team's home court before alternating venues with single contestsâto a more travel-friendly 2-3-2 schedule.\n\nThe late David Stern admitted he made the change in his first year as NBA commissioner at the behest of  Celtics patriarch Auerbach, who saw the inconveniences of long cross-country travel during the 1984 Finals between the Celtics and Lakers.\n\n\"Although he's not here to defend himself and deny it, I tell you that Red said to me back in '84, 'This is too much. Play, travel, play, travel, play, travel,' \" Stern told reporters in 2008. \"In subsequent years he said it was terrible that we changed it to 2-3-2, but a young commissioner was motivated by the father of us all.\"\n\nHigher-seeded teams (due to a better regular-season record) still had the luxury of starting the series at home, but over the years, the 2-3-2 format favored the lower-seeded squad, which got to spend an entire week in its home city playing Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) on its court.\n\nIn 2013, the NBA approved a return to the 2-2-1-1 format. It has served as the Finals schedule since 2014 with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 2, 5 and 7 and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 3, 4 and 6.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\n\n\nÂ© 2025  ABG-SI LLC - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

He was an excellent on-ball defender, using his quickness and agility to stay in front of his opponents and disrupt their shots. He was also a great help defender, always aware of where his teammates were on the court and ready to step in and provie support when needed.\n\nIn addition to his DPOY award, Jordan was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, tied for the most in league history. He shares that honor with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant. Jordan’s defensive prowess was recognized by his peers and coaches alike, as evidenced by his numerous All-Defensive selections.\n\nJordan’s defensive efforts were not limited to the regular season, either. He was a key part of the Chicago Bulls’ championship teams in the 1990s, and his defense played a crucial role in those victories. In the NBA Finals, Jordan was named the Most Valuable Player six times, and his defensive efforts were a big reason why.\n\nMichael Jordan’s defensive abilities were a major part of his success as a basketball player. His quickness, agility, and awareness on the court made him a formidable opponent for any player he faced.

          "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nMichael Jordan also dominated the NBA on defense\n\nDespite having a size disadvantage, Michael Jordan repeatedly wins his defensive matchups in the paint against Charles Barkley. (0:29)\n\nIF THERE'S ONE thing that \"The Last Dance\" has demonstrated, it's that Michael Jordan was nearly impossible to guard. But nearly as impossible was trying to score when Jordan was guarding you.\n\n\"He's the best superstar defender in the history of the game,\" LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers says. As a player, Rivers often experienced the misfortune of trying to bring the ball up the floor with Jordan tracking him end line to end line.\n\nUsually, \"imposing his will\" referred to Jordan's gravity-defying dunks or artistic layups in traffic. But it also applies to the countless times he jumped passing lanes, blocked shots of 7-footers or merely saddled up so far into the grill of perimeter shooters that they could literally smell his sweat. Jordan is the only player since 1973-74 (when steals and blocks were first recorded) to submit 200 steals and 100 blocks in two different seasons. Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon are the only other players to reach that milestone once.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nDennis Rodman wants to set the record straight on Scottie Pippen5yJackie MacMullan\n\nThe Michael Jordan I knew is about to be revealed to the world5yJackie MacMullan\n\n\"In my mind, Michael was actually a defensive player who also happened to be an exceptionally talented offensive player,\" says B.J. Armstrong, his former Bulls teammate. \"In many ways, he knew the game on that side of the ball better. The way he moved, anticipated and invented ways to score based off what he saw on the defensive end ... he never cheated the process.\"\n\nJordan's defensive acumen was apparent in real time; he was selected first team All-Defense on nine occasions, tied with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant for most ever. And during the Bulls' three-year title run featuring Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Chicago led the league in defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Bulls were perpetually on a seek-and-destroy defensive mission, aiming not just to disrupt their opponents' offensive sets but to ultimately leave them in disarray.\n\nAnd no one relished that assignment more than Jordan.\n\n\"I've always thought players who talk trash defensively are far more devastating than the scorers who say stuff,\" Rivers says. \"Michael would say, 'I know what you want to do, you're not going right at all today.' And for me, that was tough, because I was always going right.\"\n\nJordan fastidiously studied the offensive sets of opponents and committed them to memory. He expected his teammates to do the same. Missing a shot was acceptable, but if you missed a defensive assignment, you would incur the wrath of His Airness.\n\n\"All anyone wants to talk about with the Bulls is the triangle. And that's fine, I have nothing against that,\" says Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who played against Jordan in the 1992 NBA Finals with the Portland Trail Blazers and again the following year with the Phoenix Suns. \"But it was the defense that made Chicago special. We could not score against them in the last five minutes of Game 6 [in 1993].\n\n\"Charles Barkley was the MVP of the league that year and Michael just loved the challenge of shutting him down. It was personal. He was going to make sure that no one could ever think they were in his category. Not Charles, not Clyde [Drexler], not anyone.\"\n\nMichael Jordan shows off his instincts as he helps on defense and rejects Patrick Ewing's shot out of bounds.\n\nJORDAN DIDN'T MAKE his first All-Defense team until the 1987-88 season, his fourth year in the league. He led the league in steals and was 14th in blocks -- the only guard in the top 40 that season.\n\n\"He got me a couple of times,\" says former New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing. \"The thing about him and Scottie was they were big enough, strong enough and athletic enough to challenge a guy like me. Michael could take that initial bump. Most guys couldn't or didn't want to absorb the contact. He didn't care.\"\n\nJordan habitually was knocked to the floor by the team he loathed most, the Detroit Pistons, who punctured his title dreams for three consecutive seasons with a physical, defensive-oriented style. But in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals, Jordan turned the tables on the Bad Boys.\n\nIn that series, Detroit averaged just 0.79 points per play with Jordan as the primary defender, and shot just 35%, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Jordan relentlessly tracked guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, pickpocketing them in the backcourt or springing out of his low defensive stance with catlike quickness to flood their passing lanes.\n\n\"Michael had very quick hands,\" Rivers says. \"And he was very smart in how he used them. The more athletic and dominant you are, the less people give you credit for your intelligence. It's funny, [Larry] Bird and Magic [Johnson], neither of them was a super athlete, so we gave them all this credit for their brains. Well, Michael was just as clever.\n\n\"That, combined with his athleticism, made him a suffocating defender. You're bringing the ball up thinking, 'Man, is this guy even going to let me get over half court?' It was unbearable.\"\n\nIn the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, Michael Jordan gets a series of steals and blocks en route to the Bulls' first-ever NBA Finals appearance.\n\nIn 1992, Ainge finished the season with Portland. Jordan was in town as a member of the Dream Team to play exhibition games in the Tournament of the Americas. The two hit the links for 36 holes the morning of Team USA's first game against Cuba. When they were finished, Ainge hustled to drop the league MVP at the hotel so Jordan could quickly shower and join the Olympic team on the bus.\n\n\"I get to the game,\" Ainge says, \"and I'm beat. The sun was really hot that day. I'm sitting there watching Michael, and he was just unbelievable. He was picking up guys full court on every possession for the entire 30 minutes he played. I couldn't believe how much energy he had.\n\n\"We played golf the next day, too, and I asked him, 'Why were you playing so hard in an exhibition game?' And he told me, 'I don't want anyone thinking they belong on the court with me.'\"\n\nIN HIS FINAL season with the Bulls, Jordan's ability to alter a game defensively was still on display at 35 years old. He finished fourth in Defensive Player of the Year voting behind Dikembe Mutombo,  Payton and David Robinson -- 10 years after his first and only DPOY award.\n\nAntoine Walker experienced his forcefulness on opening night of the 1997-98 season. The Celtics forward was en route to a 31-point night with Jason Caffey and Scott Burrell drawing the assignment for much of the game. An exasperated Jordan, who missed 16 of his 23 shots in that game, waved off his teammates and guarded Walker for the final minutes.\n\n\"He told me he was going to shut me down,\" Walker says, \"but it was too late. We won the game. We were celebrating in the hallway afterwards and Michael saw me. He said, 'You'll never beat us again.'\n\n\"And we didn't.\"\n\nAfter sweeping the New Jersey Nets in the opening round of the 1998 playoffs, the Bulls beat Charlotte in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Hornets coach Dave Cowens made an adjustment. Cowens knew the triangle provided Jordan and Pippen post-ups 6 to 7 feet from the basket, which both players favored, so he put bruising power forward Anthony Mason, his best post defender, on Jordan. This required Jordan to track Mason defensively in transition.\n\n\"Our rotations got so crazy that our guard, David Wesley, was guarding [7-foot center] Luc Longley under the basket -- and they still wouldn't throw him the ball,\" Cowens says now.\n\nThe other adjustment the Hornets made was to position sharpshooters Glen Rice and Dell Curry on the same side of the floor offensively, so Pippen and Jordan would skew to that side to guard them. That left the Hornets the other half of the floor to run pick-and-roll without interference from the Bulls' defensive stars. Charlotte stunned Chicago in Game 2, 78-76.\n\n\"Michael knew exactly what we were doing,\" says Armstrong, who was a reserve on that Hornets team. \"So when I checked in during Game 3, he immediately said, 'I'll take him.' Now, I wasn't one of our primary offensive threats, but Jordan understood we were trying to keep him away from the ball. What better way to keep track of the ball than guarding the guy with the ball?\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he made that adjustment himself. The guy's attention to detail was impeccable. People were wondering, 'Why is Jordan guarding the backup point guard on this team?' Because those are the little differences between winning and losing.\"\n\nThe Hornets didn't win another game in the series.\n\nThe Bulls advanced to play the Indiana Pacers in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals, triggering sour memories for point guard Mark Jackson, who previously had battled Chicago while he was a member of the Knicks. Jackson warned his Pacers teammates about Jordan's uncommon defensive resolve.\n\n\"You'd beat him with a move,\" Jackson says, \"and before you know it, he was right back there in front of you. His recovery skills were exceptional.\"\n\nESPN Daily podcast\n\nMonday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nThe Bulls put Pippen on Jackson to prevent him from posting up. Jordan matched up with, among others, Reggie Miller, an assignment he once complained was like \"chicken-fighting with a woman\" because of Miller's slender frame. Miller, a legendary trash-talker, objected, dishing barbs of his own.\n\n\"I think Reggie got under Michael's skin,\" Jackson says. \"Reggie had great respect for Michael, but he wasn't afraid. Michael's saying, 'I'm going to lock you up,' but we countered with, 'It's not just you and Reggie. It's you, Reggie and the 100 picks we're going to set for him.'\" Miller rejoiced when his famous \"push-off\" game-winning jumper over Jordan fell through in Game 4, but Jordan and the Bulls had the final say, holding Miller to just one shot in the fourth quarter of the series-deciding Game 7.\n\n\"Their defense,\" Pacers coach Larry Bird said in the immediate aftermath of the loss, \"is relentless.\"\n\nMichael Jordan doubles Karl Malone in the post and comes up with a steal before sinking an iconic game-winning shot to capture the 1998 NBA championship.\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN HYPERBOLE is at an all-time high as \"The Last Dance\" nears its conclusion, and one favorite mantra is that No. 23 never took a play off on either end. Ainge says that's not entirely accurate.\n\n\"When he was averaging 38 a game, and even later, when he 'slowed down' to 30 a game, Michael was still talented enough, savvy enough and prepared enough not to exert too much energy defensively,\" Ainge says. \"I liken it to a five-speed car. He could play in third gear and be better than most. And, when he shifted into that fifth gear, which he did at the end of games, he was Scottie-like.\"\n\nIn June 1998, as Jordan's career in Chicago dwindled to its final days, he challenged his teammates to close out their \"last dance\" by dominating the game on the defensive end. Chicago's opponent, the Utah Jazz, led the NBA in offensive efficiency during the regular season (110.9 points per 100 possession), but was held to just 94.3 in those 1998 Finals. If you combine the 1997 and 1998 Finals, the Jazz failed to score 90 points in 11 of the 12 games they played.\n\nJordan ended his career with the Bulls in poetic fashion: nailing the game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the Finals, his shooting motion frozen in time. It's an unforgettable image, but what people often fail to remember is how the Bulls first got possession.\n\nSeconds earlier, John Stockton had dumped the ball into Karl Malone in the post. Rodman was denying him on the left side when Jordan burst from behind on the right, swatting the ball free and taking off up the court to make history -- again.\n\nThat's right. Jordan's most iconic moment was the result of his defense.\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James Finals Record: Reviewing LeBron James's six NBA Finals losses\n\nLeBron James is inarguably one of the best in basketball history, for some people he is the greatest of all time, but his finals record might be the Achilles heel of his legacy.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the seventh player in NBA history that reached nine finals in a career, and the fifth ever to do so eight straight seasons.\n\nGolden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-85 to sweep the series and give LeBron his sixth NBA Finals loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was also the fourth final loss for \"The King\" in five years. In nine NBA Finals James' teams have been favorites only twice, both with the Miami Heat, winning one of two.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nHowever, LeBron still has three NBA trophies and three NBA Finals MVP awards to his name and his 15th season proved he is still in his prime.\n\nAlso check out: Lebron James’ Finals Appearances and stats\n\nHere's a look at the six NBA Finals losses of LeBron James:\n\n2007 - The First Sweep: against San Antonio Spurs (0-4)\n\nJames' first trip to an NBA Finals was one to forget.\n\nLeBron led the Cavs to their first finals in franchise history just to be swept by the Spurs.\n\nCleveland was considered underdog to a San Antonio team that won its fourth NBA title with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker all in their prime.\n\nThe then 22-year-old James and Cleveland went through a hard Eastern Conference playoff, where they defeated Washington Wizards, the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons on their way to the finals.\n\nSan Antonio defeated the Cavs in the first two games easily. James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

Combined, he has scored 49,999 points in NBA games.\n\nHe will hit a milestone on Tuesday night: 50,000 points scored, regular season and playoffs combined. It’s a total nobody else is within 5,000 points of reaching, a truly historic number that will become part of his legacy. Here is everything you need to know about LeBron’s milestone.\n\nHow many career points does LeBron James have?\n\nLeBron is the NBA’s all-time leader in regular season points scored at 41,837 — he is the only player in the league’s history with more than 40,000 regular season points. LeBron has scored 8,162 points in the playoffs, also more than anyone else in the history of the league.\n\nCombined, that is 49,999 points.\n\nWhen will LeBron James break 50,000 career points?\n\nMost likely in the opening minutes of the Lakers game at home Tuesday night against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLeBron, who is averaging 24.8 points a game this season, needs just one point to hit the milestone. You can be sure Luka Doncic and every other Laker knows it and will be feeding LeBron the rock early.\n\nLeBron James vs Kareem Abdul Jabbar career points\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar has to be in any NBA GOAT conversation and owned a record that seemed unreachable: 38,387 points scored in regular season games.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2023, with Abdul-Jabbar looking on in the building, LeBron passed Kareem for the most points in NBA history with a fadeaway jumper.\n\n38,388 POINTSLeBron James hits the fadeaway jumper to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer! #ScoringKing pic.twitter.com/P5LyTZAZn3\n\nIt was an iconic moment for LeBron and a big part of his GOAT case—he has played longer at a high level than any player in NBA history. His reaching 50,000 points in regular-season and playoff games adds to that resume.\n\nNBA all-time scoring list (regular season and playoffs)\n\nHere is the NBA all-time scoring list, counting both regular season and playoff games:\n\n1. LeBron James 49,9992. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 44,1493. Karl Malone 41,6894. Kobe Bryant 39,2835. Michael Jordan 38,2796. Dirk Nowitzki 35,2237. Kevin Durant 35,1918. Wilt Chamberlain 35,0269.

Dan Issel 30,416\n\nLeBron James career stats, awards and record\n\nLeBron’s resume is mind-boggling:\n\n• Four-time NBA champion• Four-time MVP• 20-time All-NBA player (that will become 21 after this season)• 21-time All-Star• Siix-time All-Defensive team• Won the league’s scoring title in 2008\n\nOver the course of 22 seasons, he has averaged 27 points, 7.5 points, and 7.4 rebounds a game while shooting 50.7% (including 35% from 3). LeBron also has won three Olympic gold medals with USA Basketball, most recently last summer in the Paris Olympics.\n\nWhat other records can LeBron break?\n\nAs impressive as that resume — and scoring 50,000 points — is, there are a couple of other records LeBron could set before he hangs up his Nikes.\n\nLeBron is currently third in regular season games played in NBA history at 1,547, which is 13 behind Abdul-Jabbar for second (1,560). Celtics legend and Hall of Famer Robert Parish has the most games played at 1,611, a number LeBron could pass next season if he plays and remains mostly healthy.\n\nMichael Jordan holds the record for most 30+ point games in NBA history at 562, but LeBron is just two short of tying that number.\n\nA Division of NBCUniversal.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

In his 21-year career, LeBron James has never shown signs of slowing down. Looking at his recent seasons, it almost seems like he has just reached his peak.\n\nLeBron James entered the NBA as the first overall pick in the 2003 Draft, and from there, he became a four-time MVP and a perennial All-Star, ranking second in both All-Star selections and games played. He is the first player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a record that will likely remain unbeaten for decades. Moreover, on February 8, 2023, he became the all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nThe debate over the greatest of all time has never been as heated as it has been since 2012, the year of his first NBA championship. Since then, LeBron James has climbed the pyramid, surpassing other legends such as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nToday, we present to you all of LeBron James’ statistics for the Regular Season and Playoffs, indicating his position in the all-time rankings for each category.\n\nConsidering LeBron’s desire to play alongside his two sons, Bronny and Bryce, what other records will “The Chosen One” be able to break?\n\nLeBron James Stats\n\nStats | Regular Season | Playoffs\nGames Played | 7° (1.506) | 1° (287)\nMinutes Played | 1°(57,446) | 1° (11.654)\nMinutes per Game | 15° (37,17) | 13° (41,0)\nTotal Points | 1° (40.803) | 1° (8.162)\nPoints per Game | 6° (27,20) | 6° (28,5)\nPoints in a Single Game | 43° (61) | 20° (51)\nTotal Assists | 4° (11.141) | 2° (2.067)\nAssists per Game | 24° (7,40) | 16° (7,20)\nAssists in a Single Game | ND (19) | 77° (16)\nTotal Rebounds | 28° (11.315) | 6° (2.348)\nRebounds per Game | 182° (7,5) | 80° (9,03)\nTotal Blocks | 84° (1.109) | 10° (252)\nBlocks per Game | 238° (0,76) | 114° (0,96)\nTotal Steals | 10° (2.255) | 1° (454)\nSteals per Game | 68° (1,57) | 26° (1,71)\nField Goals Made | 2° (14.670) | 1° (2.857)\nThree-Pointers Made | 10° (2.381) | 2° (456)\nFree Throws Made | 4° (8.296) | 1° (1.813)\nTriple Doubles | 4° (110) | 2° (28)\nGames with 20+ Points | 1° (1220) | 1° (237)\nLeBron James’ Top Plays of the Decade\n\nLeBron James Awards\n\nAward | Title\nNBA champion | 4\nMVP | 4\nMVP Finals | 4\nNBA CUP | 1\nNBA In-Season Tournament MVP | 1\nAll NBA | 13x First Team3x Second Team1x Third Team\nNBA All Defensive | 5x First Team1x Second Team\nAll Star | 20\nAll Star Game MVP | 3\nRookie of the Year | 1\nTop Scorer | 1\nMore playing time | 3\nBest assistman | 1\nOlympic titles | 2 Gold, 1 Bronze\nFIBA World Cup | 1 Bronze\nFIBA AmeriCup | 1 Gold\nUn post condiviso da Dunkest (@dunkest)\n\nLeBron James Records\n\nHis resume is so full of accolades and broken records that we could fill a 200-page book.

          "raw_content": "Has LeBron James ever won Defensive Player of the Year? A closer look at the four-time champion's accolades\n\nThroughout his 21-year NBA career, LeBron James has racked up individual and team awards. He ranks among the most talented and highly decorated players to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA and international competition.\n\nHowever, for all of his accomplishments throughout his career, there seems to be one award that has eluded him thus far. That award is the Hakeem Olajuwon trophy, better known as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nAt this point in his career, LeBron has yet to win the NBA's DPOY, which is perhaps the only individual accomplishment he has yet to add to his trophy collection. However, he has come close several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nTwice in his career, he finished the season as the runner-up for this particular award. The first time was in 2009 when he came in behind Dwight Howard. The then-Orlando Magic Center ended up with 105 first-place votes while LeBron James came in second at 4 votes.\n\nThe second time LeBron came in second in DPOY voting was in 2013. Marc Gasol ended up winning with 30 first-place votes while LeBron James finished with 18.\n\nDespite never winning the DPOY award, he has been named to five NBA All-Defensive First teams from 2009 to 2013 and an NBA All-Defensive Second team in 2014.\n\nAlso read: LeBron James dons driving gloves for 1am drive after getting swept by Kings\n\n\n\nTaking a look at LeBron James' other awards\n\nWhile he's never been the NBA's DPOY, LeBron James has won plenty of accolades. He started his career strong by winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year award in 2004 over Carmelo Anthony and from there, the awards only kept rolling in.\n\nIn his second season in the league (2004-05), he was already named to the first of his three All-NBA Second Teams. The two other times were in 2007 and 2021. He has also been on the All-NBA Third Team three times and a part of the All-NBA First Team 13 times.\n\nHe has also been an All-Star from 2005 through 2024 and has earned the All-Star MVP award three times (2006, 2008, 2018).\n\nLeBron also won the scoring title in 2008 and has since then taken over as the league's best scorer. He is the first and only player so far to ever score over 40,000 career points and he's not done yet. He has also validated his status as an elite playmaker by being the league's assists leader in 2020.\n\nPerhaps some of the most prestigious awards in LeBron's trophy case are the four NBA MVPs he won in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013. As well as the four Finals MVPs he's earned alongside each one of his four NBA titles in 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2020 with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and the LA Lakers.\n\nHe's also earned his place among the league's greatest athletes of all time as a part of the NBA 75th Anniversary team.\n\nWhile LeBron James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year, he has certainly amassed an impressive collection of other awards.\n\nMiguel de Guzman\n\nMiguel is a basketball writer at Sportskeeda with an overall experience of 7 years. A lover of the sport owing to its mental aspect, he has played it throughout high school and college as a power forward and small forward, and has also coached high school and college basketball teams.

          "raw_content": "Listing LeBron James' Top 3 finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award\n\nMany believe LeBron James is still the best player in the NBA today, even in his 19th campaign.\n\nJames is an incredible all-around player who can score with ease and is also good at distributing the basketball after he's attracted the defense's entire attention. He is a solid passer, and many consider him one of the best ever in that aspect of the game.\n\nMoreover, 'The King' has been a solid defender throughout his career. He has used his physicality and his basketball IQ effectively, especially during fastbreaks for the opposing team, or during big moments down the stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn't always guarded the opposing team's best player in the clutch, but James was a great defender during his best days. And he's still able to produce great displays on that end of the court, even at age 37.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James' top three finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting\n\nOne of the biggest notions seen in the NBA about LeBron James is that he was 'robbed' of the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year award won by Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol.\n\nJames was more than extraordinary in 2012-13, putting up arguably his greatest display of talent for the 66-16 Miami Heat. Miami had a 27-game winning streak at one point and went on to win the title after a dramatic 2013 Finals against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nJames won the MVP award and finished second in the DPOY in what was perhaps his best chance to win that award in his career. However, he's had some other extraordinary seasons, even backed by advanced stats.\n\nIn this article, we will look into those seasons and rank James' top three finishes in the DPOY award voting.\n\nNo. 3: 2011-12 season | 4th\n\nLeBron James has finished in the top five of the Defensive Player of the Year award voting five times. He was fourth in 2011-12, when he was named the Most Valuable Player.\n\nThat year, James led the NBA in Player Efficiency Rating, Defensive Box Plus/Minus, finished second in Defensive Win Shares and put up the best Defensive Rating of his career so far, with a 97.\n\nHe was fourth in the DPOY voting with seven first-place votes and 112 points, behind Tyson Chandler, Serge Ibaka and Dwight Howard.\n\nNo. 2: 2008-09 season | 2nd\n\nThe 2008-09 season saw James win the first MVP award of his illustrious career. And he came close to winning the DPOY award as he finished second behind Orlando Magic's Dwight Howard.\n\nJames' Cleveland Cavaliers put up the league's best record in the regular season at 66-16, while LeBron led the league in PER, was second in Defensive Win Shares, second in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and third in Defensive Rating.\n\nAlthough he finished second in DPOY voting, James really did not have a chance to win as Howard had 105 first-place votes against James' four.\n\nNo. 1: 2012-13 season | 2nd\n\nAlthough 2012-13 ended tremendously for James and his Miami Heat, with an NBA title, the MVP and the Finals MVP award, the Defensive Player of the Year award escaped from James' hands, controversially.\n\nJames was the favorite in the eyes of many, only to be robbed instead. Marc Gasol won the trophy, and James' best chance to win the DPOY ended with another second place.\n\nGasol grabbed 30 first-place votes, and James was second with 18. However, advanced stats do not really show it was a great defensive year for James. But he was in the top 10 in Defensive Win Shares and Defensive Box Plus/Minus.\n\nMoreover, the eye test truly showed James dominated during the 2012-13 season, whether on offense or on defense. Teams tried to stay away from him defensively. Only Indiana Pacers forward Paul George was arguably as impactful on defense as James was.\n\nSince the 2012-13 season, James has finished in the top five of the DPOY voting only once (2016-17).\n\nAlso read: “Michael Jordan came up in the era where everybody hated each other, they did not f*** with each other” – Al Harrington says LeBron James can’t dominate an era like Michael Jordan\n\nVictor R.

James was also named the men's basketball tournament MVP and the Summer Olympics All-Star First Team.\n\nIt was the LA Lakers star's third Olympic gold medal and fourth overall, winning bronze in 2004. He won gold at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics. He skipped the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and 2020 Tokyo games before returning this year after Team USA's fourth-place finish in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nApart from four Olympic medals and one tournament MVP, James won a bronze for Team USA in the 2006 FIBA World Cup and a gold in the 2007 FIBA Americup. He was also a two-time USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year in 2008 and 2012. There's a good chance he could win that award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - High School\n\nBefore getting to the NBA, LeBron James was the most hyped high school basketball player in history.\n\nHe famously got a cover story from Sports Illustrated in 2002, where he was called \"The Chosen One.\" He has lived up to the hype but already had many accomplishments in high school for St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, Ohio.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - NBA\n\nLeBron James will likely end up with the greatest career in NBA history due to his longevity and durability.\n\nJames' greatness shone when he entered the league out of his school, and he continues to impress as the oldest player in the NBA. He won the Rookie of the Year out of the gate before moving up the ladder and cementing his legacy.\n\nHere are all the awards won by James in his career so far:\n\nApart from his accomplishments, LeBron James also holds a lot of NBA records in the regular season and playoffs.\n\nHe's the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and the only player to reach 40,000 points. He's also fourth in assists, second in minutes played, second in field goals made and the first in 20-point games.\n\nJames is even better in the playoffs, as he has the most points, field goals made, free throws made, steals, minutes played, games played, defensive rebounds and consecutive games scoring. If he continues to play into his 40s and makes the postseason, he will likely also be atop the assists and possibly triple-doubles leaderboards too.\n\nJuan Paolo David\n\nJuan Paolo is a journalist for Sportskeeda who covers the NBA and WNBA. He's been writing about basketball since 2015 and has been with Sportskeeda since 2021.\n\nJuan's allegiance lies with the Golden State Warriors and his journey with the Warriors began with their memorable victory over the Lakers in 2000, and he experienced the successes of the 'We Believe' era and the rise of Steph Curry. \n\nWhat Juan loves most about basketball is its ability to evoke a range of emotions, from adrenaline-fueled excitement to the highs of victory and the lows of defeat. To ensure complete accuracy in articles, he conducts thorough research before writing his articles.\n\nThe Warriors' victories in the 2022 and 2017 championships hold a special place in Juan's memories, as well as iconic moments like Baron Davis' dunk over Andrei Kirilenko and Goran Dragic's performance in the 2010 Western Conference semifinals.\n\nOff the court, Juan enjoys watching football, TV and movies, caring for his numerous cats, and cooking whenever time permits.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?

His impact on the league is so profound that it's almost impossible to imagine the NBA without him. From his jaw-dropping dunks to his clutch performances, Jordan didn't just play the game; he redefined it. In this article, we're going to dive deep into the impact of Michael Jordan on the NBA, exploring how he changed the game, influenced culture, and left a legacy that continues to inspire. Buckle up, because we're in for a ride!\n\nThe Rise of a Legend\n\nMichael Jordan's journey to becoming the greatest basketball player of all time began in the early 1980s. Drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Jordan quickly made a name for himself with his explosive athleticism and competitive spirit. His rookie season was a glimpse of what was to come—he averaged 28.2 points per game, won the Rookie of the Year award, and made the All-Star team. It was clear from the start that Jordan was something special.\n\nRedefining the Game\n\nJordan's impact on the game itself is immense. He wasn't just a scorer; he was a complete player who could do it all. His ability to drive to the basket, shoot from mid-range, and defend made him a nightmare for opponents. But it was his aerial acrobatics that truly set him apart. Jordan's dunks were not just highlights; they were statements. He used his athleticism to intimidate and dominate, changing the way the game was played.\n\nOne of the most iconic moments of Jordan's career was his free-throw line dunk in the 1988 Slam Dunk Contest. That dunk, along with his other aerial feats, inspired a generation of players to focus on athleticism and verticality. The NBA became a league of high-flyers, with players like Vince Carter and Kobe Bryant following in Jordan's footsteps.\n\nThe Jordan Rules and Competitive Spirit\n\nJordan's competitive spirit was legendary. He was known for his intense work ethic and his refusal to accept anything less than perfection. This attitude was contagious, and it spread throughout the Bulls organization. The so-called 'Jordan Rules'—a defensive strategy employed by the Detroit Pistons to contain Jordan—were a testament to his dominance. The Pistons knew that to beat the Bulls, they had to stop Jordan. But even with multiple defenders swarming him, Jordan found ways to score and lead his team to victory.\n\nHis competitive spirit wasn't just about winning; it was about pushing the limits of what was possible. Jordan's relentless drive inspired his teammates and opponents alike. Players like Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman thrived under Jordan's leadership, and the Bulls became a dynasty, winning six championships in the 1990s.\n\nThe Global Impact of Air Jordan\n\nBeyond his on-court achievements, Jordan's impact extended to the global stage. His endorsement deal with Nike led to the creation of the Air Jordan brand, which became a cultural phenomenon. The Air Jordan sneakers were not just shoes; they were a statement of style and performance. Kids and adults alike wanted to 'Be Like Mike,' and the Air Jordan brand became a symbol of excellence and coolness.\n\nThe global reach of the Air Jordan brand helped popularize the NBA around the world. Basketball became more than just an American sport; it became a global phenomenon. Players from all over the world began to dream of playing in the NBA, and the league expanded its reach to new markets.\n\nThe Flu Game and Other Iconic Moments\n\nJordan's career is filled with iconic moments that have become part of basketball lore. One of the most famous is the 'Flu Game' during the 1997 NBA Finals. Despite being severely ill, Jordan scored 38 points, including a crucial three-pointer that helped the Bulls win the game and eventually the championship. This performance showcased Jordan's unmatched will to win and his ability to rise to the occasion when it mattered most.\n\nOther memorable moments include his game-winning shot against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1989 playoffs, his 63-point performance against the Boston Celtics in the 1986 playoffs, and his final shot as a Bull in the 1998 NBA Finals. Each of these moments added to Jordan's legend and solidified his status as the greatest of all time.\n\nInfluence on the Next Generation\n\nJordan's impact on the NBA didn't end with his retirement. His influence continues to be felt through the next generation of players. Stars like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade have all cited Jordan as a major inspiration. They grew up watching Jordan and modeled their games after his. The competitive spirit, the work ethic, and the desire to be the best—these are all traits that Jordan passed down to the next generation.\n\nEven today, young players entering the league aspire to be like Jordan. They study his game, watch his highlights, and try to emulate his success. Jordan's legacy serves as a blueprint for what it takes to be a champion, both on and off the court.\n\nThe Jordan Brand and Business Acumen\n\nOff the court, Jordan's impact is just as significant. His business acumen and the success of the Jordan Brand have made him one of the wealthiest athletes in the world. The Jordan Brand, now a subsidiary of Nike, continues to be a major player in the sports apparel market. Jordan's involvement in the brand has ensured that it remains relevant and innovative, always pushing the boundaries of design and performance.\n\nJordan's success in business has also inspired other athletes to think beyond their playing careers. Players like LeBron James and Kevin Durant have followed Jordan's lead, investing in various ventures and building their own brands. Jordan's example has shown that athletes can be more than just players; they can be entrepreneurs and business leaders.\n\nThe Last Dance and Cultural Legacy\n\nThe release of 'The Last Dance' documentary in 2020 brought Jordan's legacy back into the spotlight. The series provided an in-depth look at Jordan's final season with the Bulls and offered insights into his competitive nature, leadership, and impact on the game. The documentary was a cultural phenomenon, drawing in both basketball fans and casual viewers alike.\n\nThrough 'The Last Dance,' a new generation of fans got to experience Jordan's greatness firsthand. The series highlighted not just his on-court achievements but also his cultural impact. It reminded viewers of Jordan's influence on fashion, music, and popular culture. The documentary solidified Jordan's status as a cultural icon and ensured that his legacy will continue to inspire future generations.\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\n\nOf course, no legend is without criticism. Jordan has faced his share of controversies and criticisms throughout his career. Some have questioned his leadership style, accusing him of being too harsh on his teammates. Others have criticized his gambling habits and his initial reluctance to speak out on social issues.\n\nHowever, despite these criticisms, Jordan's impact on the NBA remains undeniable. His competitive spirit, work ethic, and on-court achievements have left a lasting legacy that continues to inspire. Whether you love him or hate him, there's no denying that Jordan changed the game forever.\n\nConclusion: The Enduring Legacy of Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan's impact on the NBA is immeasurable.

His competitive spirit, global reach, and cultural influence have made him more than just a basketball player; he's a cultural icon.

Whether you're an athlete, a businessperson, or just someone looking to achieve greatness, Jordan's example shows that success comes from dedication, hard work, and a refusal to accept anything less than the best.\n\nSecondly, Jordan's impact on the game and culture reminds us of the power of influence.

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nMichael Jordan's Effect on NBA Basketball: Was It a Good Thing?\n\nHis legacy is one of personified greatness.  His name has become  synonymous with being the best as it is not uncommon to use his it as a standard bearer of sorts.  His game was beautiful, elegant and graceful and it inspired an entire generation of children all over America to \"be like Mike.\"\n\nYes, Michael Jordan brought the NBA and basketball's popularity in general to new heights.  His ability to soar to the basket and do things we'd never before seen captured the world's attention and helped make basketball more of a global sport than it had ever been.  Unfortunately this came with a price.\n\nMichael Jordan made scoring sexy.  His reverse layups, slam dunks, and  fadeaway shots were exciting to say the least.  But as more and more of basketball's youth tried to emulate and  imitate their favorite No. 23, we started to see that  being like Mike was easier said than done.  And as that basketball youth grew, so did the me mentality that Michael Jordan unintentionally created.\n\nSuddenly, basketball became less about five guys playing with synergy and more about one guy trying to do it all himself.  One on one play became the new style of the NBA and of youthful basketball in America and as a result, the quality of play suffered.  The ball stopped moving, the fundamentals eroded, and the shot selection fell off the map.\n\nPlayers were faster and more athletic than ever before, but they were more athletes than basketball players.  All too often, player's only goal was to score, passing only when they had to.  The end result was lower overall scores in the NBA and a poor product on the floor.  The league even changed the rules, to open things up for offenses, akin to what the NFL did to protect receivers and quarterbacks and increase scoring.  While this succeeded in inflating the scores, it has only served as a crutch for unsound basketball.  Rather than teach unselfish basketball, they've chosen to reward selfish basketball even more with cheap fouls and lousy defense.\n\nIf you watch basketball from yesteryear, the first thing you'd notice (aside from the embarrassingly short shorts) is the ball movement; the quality of shots; and how easily the overall scores reach over 100.  This is not a result of each player being better than today's, but rather quite the opposite.  It would be fair to say that overall, the players of yesteryear were less skilled with only some exceptions.  But it is because of this that they worked better as a team, with each player depending on the next, and no one player dominating the ball.  Rather than each player trying to score on their own, the players passed the ball around and moved without the ball until they got the best possible shot.  This is what basketball is all about.\n\nUnfortunately, even some of today's best basketball players suffer from the \"be like Mike\" mentality.  As unselfish as LeBron James can be, he has shown almost an inability to play without the ball.  Rather than cut back door, or do something as simple as setting an off the ball screen, he does what most players of this generation do...nothing.  Without the ball, nothing.\n\nThe most ironic part of the \"be like Mike\" effect is that Michael Jordan was one of the most fundamentally sound players in history.  He was effective with and without the ball.  He set screens.  He passed with purpose more often than out of necessity.  And his shots, though seemingly difficult at times, were almost always balanced and under control.  Somehow, these aspects of his game were lost in translation, overshadowed by the flashier parts of his game.\n\nMichael Jordan's influence on basketball was greater than any other player in NBA history.  My question is...was it necessarily a good thing?  I'm not so sure.\n\n"

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nBreaking Down Michael Jordan's NBA Legacy and Impact on the Game\n\nMichael Jordan meant more to basketball than six rings.\n\nHad someone like Shaquille O'Neal won those titles, it wouldn't have had the same impact. MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

His contributions on and off the court helped catapult the popularity of basketball to a new level -- one that now garners the attention of the world. Jordan and his trademark aerobatics are today an American icon, and have made him one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nBackground\n\nMichael Jeffery Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York on Feb. 17, 1963. He attended high school in Wilmington, North Carolina, and subsequently attended the University of North Carolina, where he helped the Tar Heels win the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown 63-62 with a 16-foot jump shot. He was awarded The Sporting News' College Player of the Year award as a sophomore and junior. He was also the recipient of the Naismith and Wooden Awards his junior year.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nJordan left college his junior year after being drafted by the NBA's Chicago Bulls as the third overall pick in 1984. Upon returning from his gold-medal performance at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Jordan quickly made his presence known on the professional level, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Jordan went on to lead the Bulls to six NBA championships -- 1991-93 and 1996-98 -- and was named the league's most valuable player five times, in 1988, '91, '92, '96 and '98. He was also voted on to the NBA All-Star team 14 times. Jordan would return to the Olympic Games in 1992, where he again won the gold medal.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nJordan was regarded as one of the best one-on-one defenders to ever play the game, and was a threat from practically anywhere on the court. He was particularly known for his ability to hit medium-range shots, which greatly contributed to his all-time leading 30.1 points per game average. He finished with 32,292 career points. Perhaps the one trademark that catapulted Jordan to legend status were his aerobatic slam dunks that drew awe from fans and admiration from other players. His athletic ability earned him the nickname \"Air Jordan.\" The image of Jordan flying through the air with tongue sticking out has become an iconic symbol for basketball and an important marketing tool for Nike, whom Jordan has had a partnership with for many years.\n\nGlobalization of Basketball\n\nJordan's accomplishments on the court and his affable personal style made him the ideal poster child, not only for the NBA, but for basketball all around the world. His presence greatly impacted attendance at games, no matter if they were in Chicago -- attendance at Chicago Stadium rose 87 percent in 1984-85 -- or on the road, and sparked a global interest in the game. Jordan had a special clause in his contract, known as the \"love-of-the-game\" clause, which allowed him to play basketball in the off-season to help promote the sport.\n\nReferences\n\nWriter Bio\n\nDan Harriman began writing professionally in 2009 and has a varied background in marketing, ranging from sports management to music promotion. Harriman holds a Bachelor of Science in journalism with an emphasis on strategic communications from the University of Kansas and earned the International Advertising Association's diploma in marketing communications.\n\nFitness\n\nYoga\n\nRecreation\n\nSports\n\nCopyright 2025 Leaf Group Ltd. / Leaf Group Media, All Rights Reserved.\n\n"

Michael Jordan is one such a figure for he revolutionized basketball and arguably helped redefine how people view athletes and sports for the rest of the world. Legendary performances, and awards that almost can’t be numbered, Michael Jordan’s accomplishments over the course of his career would indeed include cultural impact far beyond the court. Champions of the Chicago Bulls, changing trends in fashion, marketing, and the global reach of the sport, he altered his legacy as uniquely as any other such person, Michael Jordan.\n\nThis paper traces how Michael Jordan reshapes the course of basketball and stamps his footprint permanently on the world of sports culture, that covers the Michael Jordan career and impacts lastingly.\n\nGrowing Up and The Road to Glory Michael’s education in basketball began when, famously, he did not make the varsity team as a sophomore. This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

          "raw_content": "Rebound (basketball)\n\n\n\nIn basketball, a rebound, sometimes colloquially referred to as a board,[1] is a statistic awarded to a player who retrieves the ball after a missed field goal or free throw.[2]\n\nRebounds in basketball are a routine part in the game; if a shot is successfully made possession of the ball will change, otherwise the rebound allows the defensive team to take possession. Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on their team's offensive end. A rebound can be grabbed by either an offensive player or a defensive player.\n\nRebounds are divided into two main categories: \"offensive rebounds\", in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and \"defensive rebounds\", in which the defending team gains possession. The majority of rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (i.e., closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Offensive rebounds give the offensive team another opportunity to score whether right away or by resetting the offense. A block is not considered a rebound.\n\nA ball does not need to actually \"rebound\" off the rim or backboard for a rebound to be credited. Rebounds are credited after any missed shot, including air balls which completely miss the basket and board. If a player takes a shot and misses and the ball bounces on the ground before someone picks it up, then the person who picks up the ball is credited for a rebound. Rebounds are credited to the first player that gains clear possession of the ball or to the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score. A rebound is credited to a team when it gains possession of the ball after any missed shot that is not cleared by a single player (e.g., deflected out of bounds after the shot, blocked out of bounds, bounced directly off the rim out of bounds). A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a formality as according to the rules of basketball, every missed shot must be rebounded whether a single player controls the ball or not.\n\nGreat rebounders tend to be tall and strong. Because height is so important, most rebounds are made by centers and power forwards, who are often positioned closer to the basket. The lack of height can sometimes be compensated by the strength to box out taller players away from the ball to capture the rebound. For example, Charles Barkley once led the league in rebounding despite usually being much shorter than his counterparts.\n\nSome shorter guards can be excellent rebounders as well such as point guard Jason Kidd who led the New Jersey Nets in rebounding for several years. But height can also be an advantage for rebounding. Great rebounders must also have a keen sense of timing and positioning. Great leaping ability is an important asset, but not necessary. Players such as Larry Bird and Moses Malone were excellent rebounders, but were never known for their leaping ability. Bird has stated, \"Most rebounds are taken below the rim. That's where I get mine\").[3]\n\nContents\n\nBoxing out\n\nPlayers position themselves in the best spot to get the rebound by \"boxing out\"—i.e., by positioning themselves between an opponent and the basket, and maintaining body contact with the player he is guarding. The action can also be called \"blocking out\". A team can be boxed out by several players using this technique to stop the other team from rebounding. Because fighting for a rebound can be very physical, rebounding is often regarded as \"grunt work\" or a \"hustle\" play. Overly aggressive boxing out or preventing being boxed out can lead to personal fouls.\n\nStatistics\n\nStatistics of a player's \"rebounds per game\" or \"rebounding average\" measure a player's rebounding effectiveness by dividing the number of rebounds by the number of games played. Rebound rates go beyond raw rebound totals by taking into account external factors, such as the number of shots taken in games and the percentage of those shots that are made (the total number of rebounds available).\n\nRebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1950–51 season. Both offensive and defensive rebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973–74 season and ABA during the 1967–68 season.\n\nNew camera technology has been able to shed much more light on where missed shots will likely land.[4]\n\nNotable rebounders in the NBA\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLanguages\n\n"

          "raw_content": "What is a rebound in basketball?\n\nThe Basketball rebound: definition, technique and exercises\n\nThe missed shot is as much a part of basketball as the layup or even the legendary slam dunk. But what happens next? The rebound follows. In this article, we'll explain the difference between offensive and defensive rebounding, how to properly secure a rebound and how you can train rebounding both as a team and by yourself.\n\nWhat is a rebound in basketball?\n\nIn basketball, a rebound is the ball that bounces back after an unsuccessful basket attempt. The player who subsequently catches the ball (rebounding) is awarded the rebound.\n\nOn average, teams hit less than half of their shots in basketball. Even the best teams in the NBA rarely manage a shooting rate better than 50 percent. Once the ball hits the rim of board, whoever catches it just grabbed a rebound.\n\nYou often hearing talk of an offensive or defensive rebound, which refers to which team secures the ball:\r\n\nIf the offense grabs the ball, it's an offensive rebound. Despite a missed shot, the team now has another chance to score.\nIf the defending team grabs it, they secured a defensive rebound.\n\nWorth knowing: The best rebounders of the 2020/21 NBA season secured between 12 and 15 rebounds per game, which makes Wilt Chamberlain's performance all the more impressive: In 1960, he even managed 55 rebounds in a single game. That remains a record to this day. Over his entire career, he also grabbed the most rebounds in NBA history with 23,924.\n\nRebound training: basics, technique and workouts\n\nSize and jump height are very important for rebounding. However, those alone aren't enough to secure a rebound. The other aspect of a rebound in basketball comes down to technique. Let's first take a look at the basics for successful rebounding.\n\nRebound Basics\n\nOnly the interaction of different components enables you to regularly stand exactly where the ball lands and to reach it before your opponent. You should therefore train the following components specifically.\n\nJump height\n\nSure, the basket hangs at a height of 3.05 meters, and the ball flys upwards after a missed shot. The higher up you can get your hands on the leather, the better your chance of getting the rebound. Jump can compensate for a few missing centimeters.\n\nAnticipation, experience and positional play\n\nNot every ball bounces off the hoop in the same way and in the same direction. A three-pointer, for example, bounces further away than a shot from the center distance. If the ball hits the hoop after a high trajectory, it will also bounce higher, but shorter, than if it hits at a shallower angle. It is therefore important that you learn how the ball behaves so that you can position yourself accordingly. On the one hand, theoretical analysis helps, on the other hand, experience and precise observation. Rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, for example, even studied the way the ball rotates and how it affects his rebounding behaviour.\r\nIn this video clip, Rodman himself explains how he practised rebounding:\n\nUnboxing\n\nUnboxing - the favorite of almost every coach. Size and bounce alone do not guarantee a rebound in basketball. Dennis Rodman (career average: around 13 rebounds per game), for example, is one of the best rebounders in NBA history at \"only\" a good six feet. He made up for a lack of body length with an incredible feel for the path of the ball after a missed shot. He also had a talent for keeping his opponent fairly away from the ball: boxing out.\n\nBy cleverly placing yourself between the opponent and the basket, you'll block your opponent's path to the ball. Although you bend your knees, you make sure that even taller players can't simply reach over you. Because by bending forward slightly, you put more distance between the opponent and the ball.\n\nWillpower\n\nRebounding in basketball is work - and thus also serves as proof against the myth of basketball as a disembodied sport. Physicality dominates under the boards. If two players want to box out at the same time, friction occurs. There is a little pushing, but only within the rules. To hold your own there, even against bigger, stronger players, requires willpower.\n\nTiming\n\nJumping too early is no more helpful than still being on your knees when the ball has long since passed its highest point. Over time, you will develop a feeling for the right timing. So you jump off exactly when you can grab the rebound at the highest point for you personally. Because your own jumping abilities also play a central role.\n\nReactivity\n\nNo matter how well you anticipate, everything cannot be completely balanced in advance. Sometimes the ball hits the ring a few millimeters further down, so it bounces back toward the thrower instead of sliding straight forward. Other times, it claps back and forth inside the ring cylinder a few times, then falls toward the ground on one side. The faster you react in such cases, the higher the chance of the rebound.\n\nTechnique: 3 phases for a successful basketball rebound\n\nEvery rebound in basketball can be divided into three phases - and for each one, you can increase the chance of a successful rebound by keeping the following things in mind:\n\n1st phase - the flight of the ball\n\nThe work for the rebound does not start when the ball reaches the ring. Instead, immediately after it leaves the thrower's fingertips, you anticipate at what angle it might hit the ring and where.Accordingly, you move towards your position.\r\nFor the necessary stability, bend your knees slightly and take your opponent on your back, so to speak, for boxing out. First make contact with his chest and only then turn towards the basket. You should not actively hold him back with your arms. This will quickly lead to a foul whistle. Instead, raise your hands above shoulder height to shorten the way up when the ball bounces off the ring. It is important that you never position yourself statically, but always on the ball of the forefoot to remain mobile at all times.\n\n2nd phase - Rebounding the ball\n\nIf the ball bounces off the hoop, jump off at the right time. Aim to touch the ball with your hands at the highest point of your jump. To do this, raise both arms, as the two-handed basketball rebound makes it easier for you to secure the ball. You can reach a little higher if you first touch the ball with one hand and then with the other. Once you have secured the ball, pull it towards your chest while it is still in the air.\n\nPhase 3 - sticking the landing\n\nWhen landing, always make sure to bend your knees slightly and not to land stiffly. This protects the joints. To secure the ball after the rebound, spread your elbows outwards. However, do not swing them wildly back and forth. On the one hand, there is the danger of hitting the opponent in the head, and on the other hand, of committing a foul and having to give away the rebound you just secured.\n\nThen turn into the next movement - in the case of a defensive rebound, either a pass to the build-up player or your own dribbling towards the opponent's basket; in the case of an offensive rebound, a quick lay-up directly in the hoop. Make sure you do not lift your supporting leg. Otherwise you will make a step mistake. It is best to use the star step, where you only move with your free foot, to find a good angle for the next action.\n\n3 rebound exercises to improve your game\n\nThere are many aspects to rebounding. Technique, physicality and the mental aspect all play a role. At the same time, you can practice rebounding not only indidually but also as a team. Therefore, you can pick and choose the drill you need to improve your game.\n\nMental rebound training\n\nMental training has long had a footing in sports. Not only can it help with decision making but it can also increase your ability to concentrate. Both of these will definitely help with your basketball rebound. The more you can focus on the ball, its trajectory and the rebound angle, the better you can position yourself.\n\nRebound drills to do alone\n\nEven by yourself, there are plenty of ways to train effectively.\n\nOff the wall single hand catch\r\nAs safe as it would be to grab the ball directly with both hands, it actually makes more sense to grab the ball with one hand at first when rebounding. If you stretch the left hand a little further upwards, this allows a higher jump. As soon as you have one hand on the ball, immediately pull the other one up. This way you can reach for the ball at a higher point to secure it as quickly as possible afterwards.\n\nYou can practise this rebounding technique by throwing the basketball high against the wall of the house. From the rebounding position, jump up and grab it with one hand.\n\nOff the Wall Catch & Turn\r\nThe faster you turn after the rebound, the faster you can initiate the counter-attack, the fastbreak. To practise this turn, throw the basketball against the wall of the house as well. Instead of just jumping up and landing, you already turn in the air towards the imaginary other basket. A quarter turn is also enough to start with. Approach slowly and try it in both directions.\n\nOff the Wall Moving Catch\r\nSince the ball does not always bounce off the ring in the same way, do not always just stand directly in front of the wall. Try different angles and distances to prepare for rebounds that bounce different distances.\n\nReactive Bounce Catch\r\nA quick second or even third jump increases the chance of the rebound. Often, the ball does bounce directly form the rim to your hands. Zion Williamson, for example, is particularly good at this skill and often beats the opponent to the ball. To practise this movement, first hold the basketball in both hands. Now jump and slam the ball to the ground at the highest point of your jump. Once landed, jump off again to secure the rebound.\n\nWall Box Out Bounce & Catch\r\nBoxing out your opponents is a great option to help secure a rebound. However, make sure you don't push anyone - otherwise you'll draw a foul. Instead, use your arms like a shield to keep the opponents at a distance. You can even practise this at home.  Start by resting your forearm against the wall. With the other hand, bounce the basketball on the floor with pressure and then grab the rebound.\n\nRecommended: Also read up on basketball drills you can do at home.\n\nBasketball rebound drills as a team\n\nBoth the ball and the opponents are constantly moving. Communication and coordination are essential in basketball to win. This also applies to rebounding. Therefore, it's a good idea to do some rebounding exercises as a team.\n\nRotation-Rebounding\r\nThree or four offensive and three or four defensive players each run around the zone. The offense runs clockwise while the defense runs counterclockwise. As soon as the coach throws the ball, each defender looks for an offensive player to block out. Only then does the fight for the rebound begin. If the offensive team grabs the ball, it tries to score. If the defending team gets the rebound, they play to the opposite basket.\n\nSlide Rebounding\r\nSpacing - i.e. spreading the field by several distance shooters - against rebounding: The offence places itself around the three-point line, the defense lined up centrally in the zone between the baseline and the free-throw line. There, the defending players move from left to right and back again within the zone until the coach passes the ball to an offensive player and calls the name of a defender. The defender sprints towards the player with the ball, while his teammates have to find an offensive player to box out. It is important to communicate in such a way that everyone reaches an opponent as quickly as possible. After that, it is up to the defending team to secure the rebound.\n\nGolden Egg\r\nIn four pairs, the offense and defense places themselves around the circle at the free-throw line, with the defenders standing further inside. A basketball is placed in the middle. When called by the coach, the offensive players try to grab the ball by fair means, while the defenders do everything they can to stop them by boxing them out. If no offensive player has a hand on the basketball for five seconds, the defense has won and the next round is on. After a few rounds, you can switch roles.\n\nTo keep fit outside of basketball training, the best way to do this is to try indoors.\n\nBasketball rebound: definition and training tips\n\nCrucial basics, the right technique, forms of training for you alone and in a team - now you have everything you need to improve your rebounding in basketball. And to either use it to defend your own basket and get your offence going or to score quickly in attack after a missed shot by your team-mate. Possibly even with a dunk.\n\nOur tips on basketball attack and defense strategies will teach you the best way to set up your offense and defense Make sure you look the part with our customized basketball jerseys.\n\nImage Credits: Title Image: Drazen_/gettyimages; Image 2: NoSystem images/gettyimages; Image 3: South_agency/gettyimages; Image 4: gremlin /gettyimages; Image 5: technotr/gettyimages\n\nMore magazine articles\n\n"

The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

So this group of Bulls stands as not only the best Bulls team of the Jordan era but the greatest team of all time.\n\nThey won 86.7 percent of all games they played, a ridiculous percentage that places them among the most dominant teams in any major U.S. pro sport. This was the fourth Bulls championship, earned in the first full season after Michael Jordan returned from his mid-90s “retirement.” They had winning streaks of 13 and 18 games and only once lost consecutive games, to the Nuggets and Suns on an early February trip West.\n\nThey won 14 of their first 15 games in the playoffs, and the loss to the Knicks came in overtime. Of the 15 postseason victories necessary to claim the NBA title, 10 came by double-digit margins.\n\n2. 1996-97\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nAlthough there is no question the 1996 team was superior, coming back a year later and nearly matching that performance might was, at its essence, even more impressive. Jordan and Pippen ranked among the top 20 in the league in minutes, even though each already had four championship rings. Toni Kukoc’s versatility off the bench continued to escalate. He ranked third on the team in shots and scoring and second in assists, behind Pippen. They opened the season with a 12-game winning streak, an amazing feat given this was a team that knew very well the championship was not going to be won in November.\n\n3. 1991-92\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the year of Jordan’s famous shrug, a gesture during Game 1 of the Finals series with the Blazers that underscored not only a moment, but an era. It was an acknowledgment that, indeed, even he could not believe he’d gotten so good. He earned 80 of a possible 96 first-place votes for MVP, 93.8 percent of a perfect score.\n\nCartwright missed 18 games because of injury but was back for a strong run in the playoffs, when he averaged 28 minutes, including a challenging matchup with Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing in which Ewing shot 8-of-19 from the field in the decisive game.\n\n4. 1990-91\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was not a strong year for the NBA overall, still absorbing the expansion by four teams in the previous three years. Detroit’s Bad Boys were showing wear and won only 50 games. The team with the best record in the league, the Trail Blazers, proved not ready for the spotlight and fell easily to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Bulls had to surmount mental hurdles to at last win a championship with Jordan on their side. Most notable among those was getting past the Pistons, but they also had to conquer a Lakers team accustomed to winning titles (but not used to doing it without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). John Paxson’s 44 percent shooting from 3-poit range and Horace Grant’s growth into a 34-minute player were essential to the breakthrough.\n\n5. 1997-98\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThe injury that kept Pippen out at the beginning of “The Last Dance” season led to him starting only 44 games to Kukoc’s 52. By the time they Bulls were back to the playoffs, they were again using the rotation similar to what worked so beautifully the previous two years, albeit with Kukoc frequently filling Rodman’s spot as a starter.\n\nEven with Pippen missing for so long, the controversy regarding the declaration by Bulls management that Jackson would not return the following season and the distraction of Jordan constantly being asked about his future plans, the team still managed to tie the Jazz for best record in the league. It was another example of Jordan and the Bulls demonstrating that when it would be easy to relax – explicable, even – they still discovered the motivation to push through toward greatness.\n\nThere never was a \"Super Bowl hangover\" with Jordan's Bulls. Their Finals series against Utah was the most competitive of the six title teams; five of the six games were decided by two or fewer possessions. The title was won on a Jordan step-back jumper that has become among the most iconic shots in the game’s history.\n\n6. 1992-93\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the only Bulls title team that didn’t reach the 60-win plateau, with the offense fading and more reliant on Jordan than at any point during the team’s championship run. Cartwright needed more help from Scott Williams to man the middle. They essentially split time at the center spot, and together they produced a double-figure rebound average.\n\nThere was a shaky moment in the conference finals against the blossoming Knicks, who rode the tough-guy front line Ewing, Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley to 60 victories and the No. 1 seed in the East. The Bulls lost the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, then blew out the Knicks in the next two games to remind them what they were facing in challenging this dynasty.\n\nThe closest the Bulls came to losing a championship arrived then, with each having won two games and the Bulls ahead by a point with 20 seconds remaining. Forward Charles Smith got the ball inside and had four attempts to make a game-winning layup, but all were challenged and/or blocked by Bulls defenders. That was it for the Knicks. No one ever came so close again to eliminating a full-strength Jordan/Bulls team.\n\nMike DeCourcy\n\nMike DeCourcy has been the college basketball columnist at The Sporting News since 1995.

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nMichael Jordan: Why He's a 6-Time Finals MVP, 6-for-6 Champion and G.O.A.T.\n\nMichael Jordan is the only player in NBA history to never score less than 20 points in any of his Finals games but that is just one reason that every time the greatest player ever never once let his team lose in the Finals and was named Finals MVP all six times.\n\nThe truth is that although he did record the best Finals and playoff stats of any player ever it was that he was never a sidekick and he took control of every single Finals game he played in and JUST ABSOLUTELY REFUSED to let his team lose a Finals series, which no one else can really say (Duncan is 4 for 4). He never even let it get to seven games - not even once, which is sick.\n\nWilt lost in the Finals numerous times, Russell lost in the 18=958 Finals, Bird lost in the Finals, Erving lost in the Finals, West lost in the Finals, Shaq lost in the Finals (2004) and Kobe lost in the Finals twice (2004 and 2008), Kareem lost in the Finals and Magic lost in the Finals, including against MJ himself.\n\nWhy is Jordan the greatest. His stats? Yep. 10 time scoring champion? Yep. Defensive Player of the Year? Yep. Five time NBA MVP? Yep. Perfection in the Finals with 6 MVP's? Yep and Yep.\n\nHere we see why no one can can in this guys rare air.\n\nMan you should'a seen this kids! Yo, this was straight sick. MJ went up against Magic and went out and busted through with four straight wins to take his first title.\n\nThe fabled Lakers couldn't hang with this one man. Don't even try the Pippen statement. Believe me, I was there dude. Pippen could do nothing on his own and he actually kinda sucked, except on defense. But Jordan was just dirty with it. He scored and passed better than Magic himself and averaged over 10 assists and 30 points. WTF?\n\nIn game one he scored 36 points had eight rebounds, 12 assists and three steals.\n\nIn game two he scored 33 points on 15/18 shooting, seven rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a block.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 29 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, four steals and two blocks.\n\nIn game four he scored 28 points, dished off for 13 assists and had five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nIn the closer MJ had 30 points, 10 assists and five steals.\n\nCan't hate on that. That is the GOAT right there.\n\n6'7\" Drexler was in his all-around prime and the Portlans team had way more options than Chicago who had uh....Michael Jordan.\n\nHe showed what was up in the first 24 minutes of the series. No one, even if they were bigger, heavier or stronger ever could or did stop him. Did they? Nope.\n\nIn game one he scored 39 points in 34 minutes and added 11 assists, but the six threes before halftime is the most exciting half in Finals history. 35 points at halftime is still a Finals record beeatches!\n\nIn game two MJ had 39 points and 10 assists.\n\nIn game three Jordan scored 26 and had seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 32 and added five rebounds and six assists.\n\nIn game five MJ went off on 14/23 from the field and 16/19 from the line and 2/3 from threes and schooled for 46 points.\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 33 points, had four steals, four rebounds and four assists and one block.\n\nTotally unstoppable man.\n\nAll MJ went out and did was record the highest scoring average in a Finals series ever with 41.0 ppg. Yep, let's see anyone in the league today be that dirty in the Finals. IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nJust put it this way: Game one 31 points, game two 42 points, game three 44 points, game four 55 points, game five 41 points and in the closer 33 points versus Barkley, Ainge, KJ, Chambers and Majerle.\n\nYes, that was FOUR STRAIGHT FINALS GAMES WITH OVER 40 POINTS. Get yourselves a reality check people. I saw every game MJ was obviously the best player in history and Pippen wasn't really that awesome in this series. Get it real: MJ is the only reason they won against a superior team.\n\nMan, this guy was greater at age 32-33 than any player ever. He had come out of retirement in 1995 and led the Bulls to a 13-4 record to finish the 1994-95 season but the Bulls didn't make it to the Finals. MJ was rusty really, after not playing for 18 months.\n\nSo he said to himself and his teammates - watch this!\n\nHe proceeded to lead his team to the greatest single season in NBA history with a 72-10 regular season record.\n\nIn game one of the Finals MJ scored 28 points and added seven rebounds.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 29 points and added six rebounds, eight assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 36 and had five assists and two steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 23 but the rest of the Bulls were actually on fire.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 26 points and added four rebounds.\n\nIn the closer MJ and the Bulls won so easily that MJ only needed to score 22, which is the least points he has ever scored in the Finals.\n\nPayton and Kemp could stop every one but not MJ.\n\nThe Bulls were led by 34 year old Michael to the second best record in NBA history with a 69-13 record. They have the top place too with 72-10. Over two season MJ led them to 141 wins and 23 loss record.\n\nMJ was there for every game and led the NBA in scoring both times, shooting 50%.\n\nIn game one of the Finals vs Stockton and Malone and Hornacek -  MJ scored 31 points and added eight assists.\n\nIn game two he scored 38 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three he scored 26 points and had six assists.\n\nIn game four MJ scored a game high for either team with 22 points.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 38 points (he was sick that day too).\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 39 points and added 11 rebounds.\n\nMan, this dude was 34 and schooling these guys still. Jordan will not be topped we was that freaking great.\n\nAt age 35 MJ became the oldest MVP and scoring champion ever.\n\nHe also led the Bulls to a 62-20 record and took them to face Utah again.\n\nIn game one MJ had 33 points.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 37.\n\nIn game three he had 24 points in 32 minutes, because the Bulls were SO ahead.\n\nIn game four MJ scored 34 and added eight rebounds and two steals.\n\nIn game five Jordan scored 28 and had three steals.\n\nIn his last ever Finals game (cuz he retired again after this one) Jordan scored 45 points! One of his four steals led to him hitting the greatest and most famous and momentous last shot of a Finals series ever.\n\nThey way he held his hand in the air was so cool. No one left has such style.\n\nThere are over 100 reasons I can think of to explain how MJ is the greatest player who cannot be passed, especially by any player in the NBA today, but the whole point of this story is to show one thing.\n\nYes, there are player of great will and desire like Kobe, but Kobe lost in the Finals in 2004 and 2008. If Jordan was on the 2004 Lakers they would have won for damn sure. The 2004 Pistons would get stomped by the 1991 Pistons and the Lakers lost to them 4-1.\n\nKobe didn't do anything to make them win (and he had Malone, Shaq and Payton on his team so there's no excuse for losing), so he aint even in the conversation. In 2008 the Lakers lost even though they had Gasol. MJ never had a center worth much, but he never lost anyway.\n\nPut prime Jordan on the 2008 Lakers and they'd be champs for sure. You know how I know? MJ NEVER ONCE LOST IN THE FNALS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat is why Jordan is the greatest ever: they all lost and he didn't.\n\nLebron? Nope.\n\nWade? Nope.\n\nCarmelo? Nope.\n\nHoward? Nope.\n\nRose? Nope.\n\nDurant? Nope.\n\nKobe? Nope.\n\nMJ is the GOAT and you must accept it in order to be happy.\n\n"

Of those 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls for 13 (1984-93; 1995-98) and the Washington Wizards for a couple (2001-03).\n\nWhile he did record remarkable numbers for a player closer to 40 than 35, he was clearly in the twilight of his career with the WIzards. His greatest years came with the Bulls, predominantly in the 1990s when he led the franchise to six championships in as many Finals appearances over eight years.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at when Jordan won each of his six NBA titles, the numbers he put up in those seasons and the teams he beat en route to those championships:\n\n1991\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1991 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 31.5 points (1st in NBA), 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.7 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a conference-best 61-21 regular-season record (2nd in NBA). In the playoffs, Jordan averaged 31.1 points, 8.4 assists, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals as the Bulls dropped just two games en route to their first-ever title, with both losses only coming by two points.\n\nThe most iconic moment of this championship series came in Game 2 when Jordan pulled 'the spectacular move' by switching from a dunk to a left-handed layup mid-air:\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1992 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 30.1 points (1st in NBA), 6.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a league-best 67-15 record. It was the first time in franchise history that the Bulls had recorded the league's best regular-season record.\n\nIn the playoffs, this time around, the Bulls faced a lot more competition. Dropping seven games in the 1992 postseason, Jordan led the Bulls with playoff averages of 34.5 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.0 steals. With this title, the Bulls, at that time, became only the third franchise after the Lakers and the Celtics to win back-to-back championships.\n\nMORE: How Jordan dominated Drexler in the 1992 Finals\n\nWhile there were plenty of other notable 'Jordan' moments in this postseason run, including a 54-point Game 4 performance against the Knicks, arguably the most memorable is the Shrug Game - Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n#OTD: The Shrug GameMichael Jordan sets #NBAFinals record for points (35) & threes (6) in a half in Game 1 of the 1992 #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/C73Gs4T8hQ\n\n1993\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1993 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 32.6 points (1st in NBA), 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals (1st in NBA), Jordan led the Bulls to a 57-25 record (3rd in NBA).\n\nIn the quest to become only the second franchise since the Celtics of the 1960s to win three straight titles, Jordan averaged a playoff career-high 35.1 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.1 steals.\n\nDuring the 1993 postseason, he recorded two 50-point games including a 55-point masterpiece in Game 4 of the Finals:\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1996 NBA Championship:\n\nPlaying his first full season since 1993, when he led the Bulls to a 3-peat, Jordan averaged 30.4 points (1st in NBA), 6.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals. He led the Bulls to a league-best 72-10, then an NBA record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\n\nIn the postseason, Jordan averaged 30.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.8 steals as the Bulls dropped just one game en route to the Finals. In the championship series, they quickly jumped to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and SuperSonics. While Sonics retaliated and won two straight, Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\n1997\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1997 NBA Championship:\n\nFor the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as he played all 82 games. Coming off the NBA record 72 wins, the Bulls finished with a league-best 69-13 record.\n\nJust like the regular season, the Bulls breezed past the East in the playoffs and were set to face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. In the extremely competitive series, that saw an average winning margin of just six points, the defending champions came out on top.\n\n\n\nJordan averaged 31.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 steals in the playoffs. More notably, in the Finals - Game 5 to be precise - he had one of the most iconic and memorable games of his career - 'The Flu Game'.\n\n\n\nBattling the Flu, Jordan finished with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 44 minutes on the court.\n\n1998\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1998 NBA Championship:\n\nComing off 72 and 69 wins in the previous two years, the Bulls kept the momentum rolling. They tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best record of 62-20 as Jordan averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists while playing all 82 games.\n\nThe Bulls cruised past the first two rounds but in the Conference Finals, just for the second time in the Bulls championship seasons, they were taken to a Game 7 by the Indiana Pacers. After narrowly beating them, they were set for a rematch with the Jazz but this contest ended in six games as well.\n\nMORE: The most underappreciated play of MJ's career\n\nJordan ended his Bulls career with one of the best sequences of his career - a steal on Malone followed by the game-winner over Byron Russell.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nYash Matange\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\nPartners\n\n"

            "raw_content": "NBA Champions by Year: Complete History and Results of the NBA Finals\n\nJoe Lago | Apr 7, 2025\n\nBasketball's most cherished records are set in the regular season, but the playoffs is where lasting legacies are created.\n\nEach National Basketball Association season culminates in the NBA Finals, which determine the season's champion between the winners of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference. The best-of-seven game series finale also serves as the stage for players and teams to carve their places in hoops history.\n\nThe Origins of the NBA Finals\n\nThe NBA recognizes its first champion as the winner of the six-team Basketball Association of America, which began in 1947. The Philadelphia Warriors defeated the Chicago Staggs 4-1 and clinched the title behind Hall of Famer Joe Fulks, who scored 21 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5.\n\nThe Finals format of determining a champion in a first-to-four-victories series was modeled after Major League Baseball's World Series, which was the brainchild of John T. Brush. The New York Giants principal owner proposed a best-of-seven games contest between the American League and National League champs, and the \"Brush Rules\" were adopted in February 1905.\n\nThe BAA played its games in major venues, such as Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium, but the best players competed in the National Basketball League. After the NBL's four best teams joined the BAA before the 1948-49 season, the competitors merged in 1949 to create a new pro basketball leagueâthe NBA.\n\nWhen the NBA expanded from 10 to 12 teams in 1968, the basketball market in America had room for a new upstart league in the American Basketball Association. The ABA promoted a flashy, high-scoring brand of hoops, including the three-point shot, but in 1976, the league folded with four of its teams joining the NBA â Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEvery NBA Champion in History\n\nGeorge Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers won the first NBA Finals in 1950, defeating the Syracuse Nationals 4-2. The Lakers featured Hall of Famers in Mikan, Jim Pollard, Slater Martin and Vern Mikkelsen, and with the 6'10\" Mikan, they dominated defensively on their narrow home court at Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nMinneapolis would win three more NBA Finals before the league's defining dynasty took over.\n\nIn 1957, the Boston Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks 4-3 to capture their first-ever NBA championship. Under legendary coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won 10 more league crowns over the next 12 seasons. Bill Russell served as the inspirational leader and defensive anchor for all 11 title teams and is the record holder for most NBA championships by a player.\n\nThe Celtics enjoyed another run of success in the 1980s, but it coincided with the emergence of a new Lakers dynasty in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson rivalry that elevated college basketball to new heights had the same game-changing impact on the NBA. The two all-time greats faced off in some of the league's most memorable Finals battles and combined for eight championships in the 80sâJohnson outdueling Bird 5-3 in Larry O'Brien Trophy wins.\n\nMore dynasties would rule the NBA.\n\nIn the 1990s, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls achieved not one but two three-peats by winning three consecutive titles from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998. Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors ushered in a new era of prioritizing the three-pointer when they won the 2015 crown, the first of four championships in an eight-year period.\n\nThe Celtics have won the most NBA titles with 18, one more than the Lakers. The Warriors rank third with seven championships. The Bulls and Spurs have won six and five NBA crowns, respectively.\n\nYear | Winning Team | Losing Team | Series Result | Finals MVP\n1947 | Philadelphia Warriors | Chicago Stags | 4-1 | \n1948 |

in NBA Finals History\n\nThe NBA's all-time greats each have produced an iconic Finals moment that lives on in the memories of basketball fans and in perpetuity on YouTube. The most celebrated plays are the clutch shots that helped their teams secure the championship.\n\nArguably the most iconic shot in NBA history is Michael Jordan's 20-foot jumper that clinched the Bulls' 1998 title against the Utah Jazz. Expected to retire after the series, the 34-year-old Jordan scored on a layup to cut Chicago's deficit to one point, stole the ball from Karl Malone and then crossed over Bryon Russell to bury the go-ahead basket with 5.2 seconds left.\n\nJordan walked away from basketball (temporarily) after winning his sixth NBA championship.\n\nLeBron James, who shares the \"Greatest of All Time\" status with Jordan, has his own Finals highlight with the most historic display of championship-level defense for his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIn Game 7 of perhaps the greatest NBA Finals ever against the record-setting 73-win Warriors in 2016, James chased down Andre Iguodala to block his layup attempt and keep the score tied at 89 with less than two minutes remaining. Kyrie Irving's three-pointer with 53.0 seconds left gave the Cavaliers the lead for good as Cleveland completed a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nNBA Finals lore also features dominant one-man performances.\n\nMagic Johnson famously filled in for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals, and the 20-year-old rookie totaled 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists to lead the Lakers to a title-clinching 123-107 victory.\n\nOn one historic occasion, the mere presence of a player provided the inspiration to win the championship. That uplifting scenario took place in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals with New York Knicks center Willis Reed.\n\nReed wasn't expected to play the series finale against the Lakers after suffering a muscle tear in his right thigh, but he shocked his teammates when he walked onto the court for pregame warmups. The Madison Square Garden crowd greeted him with a standing ovation.\n\nReed summoned the will and energy to play \"on one leg\" while trying to defend Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks captain played 27 minutes and finished with only four points, well below his 21.7-point average, but New York rallied behind Walt Frazier's 36 points and 19 assists to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\nLow TV ratings relegated the NBA Finals to be broadcast on tape delay in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, viewers who tuned in to Game 5 of the 1976 Finals were treated to an epic three-overtime battle between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe craziest sequence took place at the end of the second OT when John Havlicek banked in a 15-foot shot for what appeared to be the game-winner. One second was still on the clock, and it was more than enough time for Garfield Heard to sink a 20-foot turnaround jumper to force a third overtime.\n\nBoston eventually would win 128-126 to take a 3-2 series lead en route to the franchise's 13th NBA crown.\n\nEvolution of the NBA Finals Format\n\nIn 1985, the NBA changed its Finals format from 2-2-1-1-1âplaying consecutive games on each team's home court before alternating venues with single contestsâto a more travel-friendly 2-3-2 schedule.\n\nThe late David Stern admitted he made the change in his first year as NBA commissioner at the behest of  Celtics patriarch Auerbach, who saw the inconveniences of long cross-country travel during the 1984 Finals between the Celtics and Lakers.\n\n\"Although he's not here to defend himself and deny it, I tell you that Red said to me back in '84, 'This is too much. Play, travel, play, travel, play, travel,' \" Stern told reporters in 2008. \"In subsequent years he said it was terrible that we changed it to 2-3-2, but a young commissioner was motivated by the father of us all.\"\n\nHigher-seeded teams (due to a better regular-season record) still had the luxury of starting the series at home, but over the years, the 2-3-2 format favored the lower-seeded squad, which got to spend an entire week in its home city playing Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) on its court.\n\nIn 2013, the NBA approved a return to the 2-2-1-1 format. It has served as the Finals schedule since 2014 with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 2, 5 and 7 and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 3, 4 and 6.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\n\n\nÂ© 2025  ABG-SI LLC - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

He was an excellent on-ball defender, using his quickness and agility to stay in front of his opponents and disrupt their shots. He was also a great help defender, always aware of where his teammates were on the court and ready to step in and provie support when needed.\n\nIn addition to his DPOY award, Jordan was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, tied for the most in league history. He shares that honor with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant. Jordan’s defensive prowess was recognized by his peers and coaches alike, as evidenced by his numerous All-Defensive selections.\n\nJordan’s defensive efforts were not limited to the regular season, either. He was a key part of the Chicago Bulls’ championship teams in the 1990s, and his defense played a crucial role in those victories. In the NBA Finals, Jordan was named the Most Valuable Player six times, and his defensive efforts were a big reason why.\n\nMichael Jordan’s defensive abilities were a major part of his success as a basketball player. His quickness, agility, and awareness on the court made him a formidable opponent for any player he faced.

            "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nMichael Jordan also dominated the NBA on defense\n\nDespite having a size disadvantage, Michael Jordan repeatedly wins his defensive matchups in the paint against Charles Barkley. (0:29)\n\nIF THERE'S ONE thing that \"The Last Dance\" has demonstrated, it's that Michael Jordan was nearly impossible to guard. But nearly as impossible was trying to score when Jordan was guarding you.\n\n\"He's the best superstar defender in the history of the game,\" LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers says. As a player, Rivers often experienced the misfortune of trying to bring the ball up the floor with Jordan tracking him end line to end line.\n\nUsually, \"imposing his will\" referred to Jordan's gravity-defying dunks or artistic layups in traffic. But it also applies to the countless times he jumped passing lanes, blocked shots of 7-footers or merely saddled up so far into the grill of perimeter shooters that they could literally smell his sweat. Jordan is the only player since 1973-74 (when steals and blocks were first recorded) to submit 200 steals and 100 blocks in two different seasons. Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon are the only other players to reach that milestone once.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nDennis Rodman wants to set the record straight on Scottie Pippen5yJackie MacMullan\n\nThe Michael Jordan I knew is about to be revealed to the world5yJackie MacMullan\n\n\"In my mind, Michael was actually a defensive player who also happened to be an exceptionally talented offensive player,\" says B.J. Armstrong, his former Bulls teammate. \"In many ways, he knew the game on that side of the ball better. The way he moved, anticipated and invented ways to score based off what he saw on the defensive end ... he never cheated the process.\"\n\nJordan's defensive acumen was apparent in real time; he was selected first team All-Defense on nine occasions, tied with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant for most ever. And during the Bulls' three-year title run featuring Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Chicago led the league in defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Bulls were perpetually on a seek-and-destroy defensive mission, aiming not just to disrupt their opponents' offensive sets but to ultimately leave them in disarray.\n\nAnd no one relished that assignment more than Jordan.\n\n\"I've always thought players who talk trash defensively are far more devastating than the scorers who say stuff,\" Rivers says. \"Michael would say, 'I know what you want to do, you're not going right at all today.' And for me, that was tough, because I was always going right.\"\n\nJordan fastidiously studied the offensive sets of opponents and committed them to memory. He expected his teammates to do the same. Missing a shot was acceptable, but if you missed a defensive assignment, you would incur the wrath of His Airness.\n\n\"All anyone wants to talk about with the Bulls is the triangle. And that's fine, I have nothing against that,\" says Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who played against Jordan in the 1992 NBA Finals with the Portland Trail Blazers and again the following year with the Phoenix Suns. \"But it was the defense that made Chicago special. We could not score against them in the last five minutes of Game 6 [in 1993].\n\n\"Charles Barkley was the MVP of the league that year and Michael just loved the challenge of shutting him down. It was personal. He was going to make sure that no one could ever think they were in his category. Not Charles, not Clyde [Drexler], not anyone.\"\n\nMichael Jordan shows off his instincts as he helps on defense and rejects Patrick Ewing's shot out of bounds.\n\nJORDAN DIDN'T MAKE his first All-Defense team until the 1987-88 season, his fourth year in the league. He led the league in steals and was 14th in blocks -- the only guard in the top 40 that season.\n\n\"He got me a couple of times,\" says former New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing. \"The thing about him and Scottie was they were big enough, strong enough and athletic enough to challenge a guy like me. Michael could take that initial bump. Most guys couldn't or didn't want to absorb the contact. He didn't care.\"\n\nJordan habitually was knocked to the floor by the team he loathed most, the Detroit Pistons, who punctured his title dreams for three consecutive seasons with a physical, defensive-oriented style. But in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals, Jordan turned the tables on the Bad Boys.\n\nIn that series, Detroit averaged just 0.79 points per play with Jordan as the primary defender, and shot just 35%, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Jordan relentlessly tracked guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, pickpocketing them in the backcourt or springing out of his low defensive stance with catlike quickness to flood their passing lanes.\n\n\"Michael had very quick hands,\" Rivers says. \"And he was very smart in how he used them. The more athletic and dominant you are, the less people give you credit for your intelligence. It's funny, [Larry] Bird and Magic [Johnson], neither of them was a super athlete, so we gave them all this credit for their brains. Well, Michael was just as clever.\n\n\"That, combined with his athleticism, made him a suffocating defender. You're bringing the ball up thinking, 'Man, is this guy even going to let me get over half court?' It was unbearable.\"\n\nIn the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, Michael Jordan gets a series of steals and blocks en route to the Bulls' first-ever NBA Finals appearance.\n\nIn 1992, Ainge finished the season with Portland. Jordan was in town as a member of the Dream Team to play exhibition games in the Tournament of the Americas. The two hit the links for 36 holes the morning of Team USA's first game against Cuba. When they were finished, Ainge hustled to drop the league MVP at the hotel so Jordan could quickly shower and join the Olympic team on the bus.\n\n\"I get to the game,\" Ainge says, \"and I'm beat. The sun was really hot that day. I'm sitting there watching Michael, and he was just unbelievable. He was picking up guys full court on every possession for the entire 30 minutes he played. I couldn't believe how much energy he had.\n\n\"We played golf the next day, too, and I asked him, 'Why were you playing so hard in an exhibition game?' And he told me, 'I don't want anyone thinking they belong on the court with me.'\"\n\nIN HIS FINAL season with the Bulls, Jordan's ability to alter a game defensively was still on display at 35 years old. He finished fourth in Defensive Player of the Year voting behind Dikembe Mutombo,  Payton and David Robinson -- 10 years after his first and only DPOY award.\n\nAntoine Walker experienced his forcefulness on opening night of the 1997-98 season. The Celtics forward was en route to a 31-point night with Jason Caffey and Scott Burrell drawing the assignment for much of the game. An exasperated Jordan, who missed 16 of his 23 shots in that game, waved off his teammates and guarded Walker for the final minutes.\n\n\"He told me he was going to shut me down,\" Walker says, \"but it was too late. We won the game. We were celebrating in the hallway afterwards and Michael saw me. He said, 'You'll never beat us again.'\n\n\"And we didn't.\"\n\nAfter sweeping the New Jersey Nets in the opening round of the 1998 playoffs, the Bulls beat Charlotte in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Hornets coach Dave Cowens made an adjustment. Cowens knew the triangle provided Jordan and Pippen post-ups 6 to 7 feet from the basket, which both players favored, so he put bruising power forward Anthony Mason, his best post defender, on Jordan. This required Jordan to track Mason defensively in transition.\n\n\"Our rotations got so crazy that our guard, David Wesley, was guarding [7-foot center] Luc Longley under the basket -- and they still wouldn't throw him the ball,\" Cowens says now.\n\nThe other adjustment the Hornets made was to position sharpshooters Glen Rice and Dell Curry on the same side of the floor offensively, so Pippen and Jordan would skew to that side to guard them. That left the Hornets the other half of the floor to run pick-and-roll without interference from the Bulls' defensive stars. Charlotte stunned Chicago in Game 2, 78-76.\n\n\"Michael knew exactly what we were doing,\" says Armstrong, who was a reserve on that Hornets team. \"So when I checked in during Game 3, he immediately said, 'I'll take him.' Now, I wasn't one of our primary offensive threats, but Jordan understood we were trying to keep him away from the ball. What better way to keep track of the ball than guarding the guy with the ball?\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he made that adjustment himself. The guy's attention to detail was impeccable. People were wondering, 'Why is Jordan guarding the backup point guard on this team?' Because those are the little differences between winning and losing.\"\n\nThe Hornets didn't win another game in the series.\n\nThe Bulls advanced to play the Indiana Pacers in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals, triggering sour memories for point guard Mark Jackson, who previously had battled Chicago while he was a member of the Knicks. Jackson warned his Pacers teammates about Jordan's uncommon defensive resolve.\n\n\"You'd beat him with a move,\" Jackson says, \"and before you know it, he was right back there in front of you. His recovery skills were exceptional.\"\n\nESPN Daily podcast\n\nMonday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nThe Bulls put Pippen on Jackson to prevent him from posting up. Jordan matched up with, among others, Reggie Miller, an assignment he once complained was like \"chicken-fighting with a woman\" because of Miller's slender frame. Miller, a legendary trash-talker, objected, dishing barbs of his own.\n\n\"I think Reggie got under Michael's skin,\" Jackson says. \"Reggie had great respect for Michael, but he wasn't afraid. Michael's saying, 'I'm going to lock you up,' but we countered with, 'It's not just you and Reggie. It's you, Reggie and the 100 picks we're going to set for him.'\" Miller rejoiced when his famous \"push-off\" game-winning jumper over Jordan fell through in Game 4, but Jordan and the Bulls had the final say, holding Miller to just one shot in the fourth quarter of the series-deciding Game 7.\n\n\"Their defense,\" Pacers coach Larry Bird said in the immediate aftermath of the loss, \"is relentless.\"\n\nMichael Jordan doubles Karl Malone in the post and comes up with a steal before sinking an iconic game-winning shot to capture the 1998 NBA championship.\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN HYPERBOLE is at an all-time high as \"The Last Dance\" nears its conclusion, and one favorite mantra is that No. 23 never took a play off on either end. Ainge says that's not entirely accurate.\n\n\"When he was averaging 38 a game, and even later, when he 'slowed down' to 30 a game, Michael was still talented enough, savvy enough and prepared enough not to exert too much energy defensively,\" Ainge says. \"I liken it to a five-speed car. He could play in third gear and be better than most. And, when he shifted into that fifth gear, which he did at the end of games, he was Scottie-like.\"\n\nIn June 1998, as Jordan's career in Chicago dwindled to its final days, he challenged his teammates to close out their \"last dance\" by dominating the game on the defensive end. Chicago's opponent, the Utah Jazz, led the NBA in offensive efficiency during the regular season (110.9 points per 100 possession), but was held to just 94.3 in those 1998 Finals. If you combine the 1997 and 1998 Finals, the Jazz failed to score 90 points in 11 of the 12 games they played.\n\nJordan ended his career with the Bulls in poetic fashion: nailing the game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the Finals, his shooting motion frozen in time. It's an unforgettable image, but what people often fail to remember is how the Bulls first got possession.\n\nSeconds earlier, John Stockton had dumped the ball into Karl Malone in the post. Rodman was denying him on the left side when Jordan burst from behind on the right, swatting the ball free and taking off up the court to make history -- again.\n\nThat's right. Jordan's most iconic moment was the result of his defense.\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James Finals Record: Reviewing LeBron James's six NBA Finals losses\n\nLeBron James is inarguably one of the best in basketball history, for some people he is the greatest of all time, but his finals record might be the Achilles heel of his legacy.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the seventh player in NBA history that reached nine finals in a career, and the fifth ever to do so eight straight seasons.\n\nGolden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-85 to sweep the series and give LeBron his sixth NBA Finals loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was also the fourth final loss for \"The King\" in five years. In nine NBA Finals James' teams have been favorites only twice, both with the Miami Heat, winning one of two.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nHowever, LeBron still has three NBA trophies and three NBA Finals MVP awards to his name and his 15th season proved he is still in his prime.\n\nAlso check out: Lebron James’ Finals Appearances and stats\n\nHere's a look at the six NBA Finals losses of LeBron James:\n\n2007 - The First Sweep: against San Antonio Spurs (0-4)\n\nJames' first trip to an NBA Finals was one to forget.\n\nLeBron led the Cavs to their first finals in franchise history just to be swept by the Spurs.\n\nCleveland was considered underdog to a San Antonio team that won its fourth NBA title with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker all in their prime.\n\nThe then 22-year-old James and Cleveland went through a hard Eastern Conference playoff, where they defeated Washington Wizards, the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons on their way to the finals.\n\nSan Antonio defeated the Cavs in the first two games easily. James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

Combined, he has scored 49,999 points in NBA games.\n\nHe will hit a milestone on Tuesday night: 50,000 points scored, regular season and playoffs combined. It’s a total nobody else is within 5,000 points of reaching, a truly historic number that will become part of his legacy. Here is everything you need to know about LeBron’s milestone.\n\nHow many career points does LeBron James have?\n\nLeBron is the NBA’s all-time leader in regular season points scored at 41,837 — he is the only player in the league’s history with more than 40,000 regular season points. LeBron has scored 8,162 points in the playoffs, also more than anyone else in the history of the league.\n\nCombined, that is 49,999 points.\n\nWhen will LeBron James break 50,000 career points?\n\nMost likely in the opening minutes of the Lakers game at home Tuesday night against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLeBron, who is averaging 24.8 points a game this season, needs just one point to hit the milestone. You can be sure Luka Doncic and every other Laker knows it and will be feeding LeBron the rock early.\n\nLeBron James vs Kareem Abdul Jabbar career points\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar has to be in any NBA GOAT conversation and owned a record that seemed unreachable: 38,387 points scored in regular season games.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2023, with Abdul-Jabbar looking on in the building, LeBron passed Kareem for the most points in NBA history with a fadeaway jumper.\n\n38,388 POINTSLeBron James hits the fadeaway jumper to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer! #ScoringKing pic.twitter.com/P5LyTZAZn3\n\nIt was an iconic moment for LeBron and a big part of his GOAT case—he has played longer at a high level than any player in NBA history.

LeBron also has won three Olympic gold medals with USA Basketball, most recently last summer in the Paris Olympics.\n\nWhat other records can LeBron break?\n\nAs impressive as that resume — and scoring 50,000 points — is, there are a couple of other records LeBron could set before he hangs up his Nikes.\n\nLeBron is currently third in regular season games played in NBA history at 1,547, which is 13 behind Abdul-Jabbar for second (1,560). Celtics legend and Hall of Famer Robert Parish has the most games played at 1,611, a number LeBron could pass next season if he plays and remains mostly healthy.\n\nMichael Jordan holds the record for most 30+ point games in NBA history at 562, but LeBron is just two short of tying that number.\n\nA Division of NBCUniversal.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

In his 21-year career, LeBron James has never shown signs of slowing down. Looking at his recent seasons, it almost seems like he has just reached his peak.\n\nLeBron James entered the NBA as the first overall pick in the 2003 Draft, and from there, he became a four-time MVP and a perennial All-Star, ranking second in both All-Star selections and games played. He is the first player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a record that will likely remain unbeaten for decades. Moreover, on February 8, 2023, he became the all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nThe debate over the greatest of all time has never been as heated as it has been since 2012, the year of his first NBA championship.

            "raw_content": "Has LeBron James ever won Defensive Player of the Year? A closer look at the four-time champion's accolades\n\nThroughout his 21-year NBA career, LeBron James has racked up individual and team awards. He ranks among the most talented and highly decorated players to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA and international competition.\n\nHowever, for all of his accomplishments throughout his career, there seems to be one award that has eluded him thus far. That award is the Hakeem Olajuwon trophy, better known as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nAt this point in his career, LeBron has yet to win the NBA's DPOY, which is perhaps the only individual accomplishment he has yet to add to his trophy collection. However, he has come close several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nTwice in his career, he finished the season as the runner-up for this particular award. The first time was in 2009 when he came in behind Dwight Howard. The then-Orlando Magic Center ended up with 105 first-place votes while LeBron James came in second at 4 votes.\n\nThe second time LeBron came in second in DPOY voting was in 2013. Marc Gasol ended up winning with 30 first-place votes while LeBron James finished with 18.\n\nDespite never winning the DPOY award, he has been named to five NBA All-Defensive First teams from 2009 to 2013 and an NBA All-Defensive Second team in 2014.\n\nAlso read: LeBron James dons driving gloves for 1am drive after getting swept by Kings\n\n\n\nTaking a look at LeBron James' other awards\n\nWhile he's never been the NBA's DPOY, LeBron James has won plenty of accolades. He started his career strong by winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year award in 2004 over Carmelo Anthony and from there, the awards only kept rolling in.\n\nIn his second season in the league (2004-05), he was already named to the first of his three All-NBA Second Teams. The two other times were in 2007 and 2021. He has also been on the All-NBA Third Team three times and a part of the All-NBA First Team 13 times.\n\nHe has also been an All-Star from 2005 through 2024 and has earned the All-Star MVP award three times (2006, 2008, 2018).\n\nLeBron also won the scoring title in 2008 and has since then taken over as the league's best scorer. He is the first and only player so far to ever score over 40,000 career points and he's not done yet. He has also validated his status as an elite playmaker by being the league's assists leader in 2020.\n\nPerhaps some of the most prestigious awards in LeBron's trophy case are the four NBA MVPs he won in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013. As well as the four Finals MVPs he's earned alongside each one of his four NBA titles in 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2020 with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and the LA Lakers.\n\nHe's also earned his place among the league's greatest athletes of all time as a part of the NBA 75th Anniversary team.\n\nWhile LeBron James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year, he has certainly amassed an impressive collection of other awards.\n\nMiguel de Guzman\n\nMiguel is a basketball writer at Sportskeeda with an overall experience of 7 years. A lover of the sport owing to its mental aspect, he has played it throughout high school and college as a power forward and small forward, and has also coached high school and college basketball teams. These experiences have given him a unique perspective on the game, which translates into insightful content.\n\nFor Miguel, the San Antonio Spurs, especially during the Tim Duncan era, were the embodiment of team basketball. He respects Gregg Popovich's empathy toward his players and his understanding of the game. The Spurs' titles, Kobe Bryant's poignant \"Dear Basketball\" tribute, Derrick Rose's remarkable 50-point game with Minnesota and Magic Johnson's remarkable comeback are among Miguel's top basketball moments.\n\nFor his articles, he conducts thorough research, cross verifies information with at least three sources, and sometimes sacrifices speed for accuracy.

            "raw_content": "Listing LeBron James' Top 3 finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award\n\nMany believe LeBron James is still the best player in the NBA today, even in his 19th campaign.\n\nJames is an incredible all-around player who can score with ease and is also good at distributing the basketball after he's attracted the defense's entire attention. He is a solid passer, and many consider him one of the best ever in that aspect of the game.\n\nMoreover, 'The King' has been a solid defender throughout his career. He has used his physicality and his basketball IQ effectively, especially during fastbreaks for the opposing team, or during big moments down the stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn't always guarded the opposing team's best player in the clutch, but James was a great defender during his best days. And he's still able to produce great displays on that end of the court, even at age 37.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James' top three finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting\n\nOne of the biggest notions seen in the NBA about LeBron James is that he was 'robbed' of the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year award won by Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol.\n\nJames was more than extraordinary in 2012-13, putting up arguably his greatest display of talent for the 66-16 Miami Heat. Miami had a 27-game winning streak at one point and went on to win the title after a dramatic 2013 Finals against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nJames won the MVP award and finished second in the DPOY in what was perhaps his best chance to win that award in his career. However, he's had some other extraordinary seasons, even backed by advanced stats.\n\nIn this article, we will look into those seasons and rank James' top three finishes in the DPOY award voting.\n\nNo. 3: 2011-12 season | 4th\n\nLeBron James has finished in the top five of the Defensive Player of the Year award voting five times. He was fourth in 2011-12, when he was named the Most Valuable Player.\n\nThat year, James led the NBA in Player Efficiency Rating, Defensive Box Plus/Minus, finished second in Defensive Win Shares and put up the best Defensive Rating of his career so far, with a 97.\n\nHe was fourth in the DPOY voting with seven first-place votes and 112 points, behind Tyson Chandler, Serge Ibaka and Dwight Howard.\n\nNo. 2: 2008-09 season | 2nd\n\nThe 2008-09 season saw James win the first MVP award of his illustrious career. And he came close to winning the DPOY award as he finished second behind Orlando Magic's Dwight Howard.\n\nJames' Cleveland Cavaliers put up the league's best record in the regular season at 66-16, while LeBron led the league in PER, was second in Defensive Win Shares, second in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and third in Defensive Rating.\n\nAlthough he finished second in DPOY voting, James really did not have a chance to win as Howard had 105 first-place votes against James' four.\n\nNo. 1: 2012-13 season | 2nd\n\nAlthough 2012-13 ended tremendously for James and his Miami Heat, with an NBA title, the MVP and the Finals MVP award, the Defensive Player of the Year award escaped from James' hands, controversially.\n\nJames was the favorite in the eyes of many, only to be robbed instead. Marc Gasol won the trophy, and James' best chance to win the DPOY ended with another second place.\n\nGasol grabbed 30 first-place votes, and James was second with 18. However, advanced stats do not really show it was a great defensive year for James. But he was in the top 10 in Defensive Win Shares and Defensive Box Plus/Minus.\n\nMoreover, the eye test truly showed James dominated during the 2012-13 season, whether on offense or on defense. Teams tried to stay away from him defensively. Only Indiana Pacers forward Paul George was arguably as impactful on defense as James was.\n\nSince the 2012-13 season, James has finished in the top five of the DPOY voting only once (2016-17).\n\nAlso read: “Michael Jordan came up in the era where everybody hated each other, they did not f*** with each other” – Al Harrington says LeBron James can’t dominate an era like Michael Jordan\n\nVictor R.

James was also named the men's basketball tournament MVP and the Summer Olympics All-Star First Team.\n\nIt was the LA Lakers star's third Olympic gold medal and fourth overall, winning bronze in 2004. He won gold at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics. He skipped the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and 2020 Tokyo games before returning this year after Team USA's fourth-place finish in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nApart from four Olympic medals and one tournament MVP, James won a bronze for Team USA in the 2006 FIBA World Cup and a gold in the 2007 FIBA Americup. He was also a two-time USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year in 2008 and 2012. There's a good chance he could win that award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - High School\n\nBefore getting to the NBA, LeBron James was the most hyped high school basketball player in history.\n\nHe famously got a cover story from Sports Illustrated in 2002, where he was called \"The Chosen One.\" He has lived up to the hype but already had many accomplishments in high school for St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, Ohio.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - NBA\n\nLeBron James will likely end up with the greatest career in NBA history due to his longevity and durability.\n\nJames' greatness shone when he entered the league out of his school, and he continues to impress as the oldest player in the NBA. He won the Rookie of the Year out of the gate before moving up the ladder and cementing his legacy.\n\nHere are all the awards won by James in his career so far:\n\nApart from his accomplishments, LeBron James also holds a lot of NBA records in the regular season and playoffs.\n\nHe's the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and the only player to reach 40,000 points. He's also fourth in assists, second in minutes played, second in field goals made and the first in 20-point games.\n\nJames is even better in the playoffs, as he has the most points, field goals made, free throws made, steals, minutes played, games played, defensive rebounds and consecutive games scoring. If he continues to play into his 40s and makes the postseason, he will likely also be atop the assists and possibly triple-doubles leaderboards too.\n\nJuan Paolo David\n\nJuan Paolo is a journalist for Sportskeeda who covers the NBA and WNBA. He's been writing about basketball since 2015 and has been with Sportskeeda since 2021.\n\nJuan's allegiance lies with the Golden State Warriors and his journey with the Warriors began with their memorable victory over the Lakers in 2000, and he experienced the successes of the 'We Believe' era and the rise of Steph Curry. \n\nWhat Juan loves most about basketball is its ability to evoke a range of emotions, from adrenaline-fueled excitement to the highs of victory and the lows of defeat. To ensure complete accuracy in articles, he conducts thorough research before writing his articles.\n\nThe Warriors' victories in the 2022 and 2017 championships hold a special place in Juan's memories, as well as iconic moments like Baron Davis' dunk over Andrei Kirilenko and Goran Dragic's performance in the 2010 Western Conference semifinals.\n\nOff the court, Juan enjoys watching football, TV and movies, caring for his numerous cats, and cooking whenever time permits.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?

His impact on the league is so profound that it's almost impossible to imagine the NBA without him. From his jaw-dropping dunks to his clutch performances, Jordan didn't just play the game; he redefined it. In this article, we're going to dive deep into the impact of Michael Jordan on the NBA, exploring how he changed the game, influenced culture, and left a legacy that continues to inspire. Buckle up, because we're in for a ride!\n\nThe Rise of a Legend\n\nMichael Jordan's journey to becoming the greatest basketball player of all time began in the early 1980s. Drafted by the Chicago Bulls in 1984, Jordan quickly made a name for himself with his explosive athleticism and competitive spirit. His rookie season was a glimpse of what was to come—he averaged 28.2 points per game, won the Rookie of the Year award, and made the All-Star team. It was clear from the start that Jordan was something special.\n\nRedefining the Game\n\nJordan's impact on the game itself is immense. He wasn't just a scorer; he was a complete player who could do it all. His ability to drive to the basket, shoot from mid-range, and defend made him a nightmare for opponents. But it was his aerial acrobatics that truly set him apart. Jordan's dunks were not just highlights; they were statements. He used his athleticism to intimidate and dominate, changing the way the game was played.\n\nOne of the most iconic moments of Jordan's career was his free-throw line dunk in the 1988 Slam Dunk Contest. That dunk, along with his other aerial feats, inspired a generation of players to focus on athleticism and verticality. The NBA became a league of high-flyers, with players like Vince Carter and Kobe Bryant following in Jordan's footsteps.\n\nThe Jordan Rules and Competitive Spirit\n\nJordan's competitive spirit was legendary. He was known for his intense work ethic and his refusal to accept anything less than perfection. This attitude was contagious, and it spread throughout the Bulls organization. The so-called 'Jordan Rules'—a defensive strategy employed by the Detroit Pistons to contain Jordan—were a testament to his dominance. The Pistons knew that to beat the Bulls, they had to stop Jordan. But even with multiple defenders swarming him, Jordan found ways to score and lead his team to victory.\n\nHis competitive spirit wasn't just about winning; it was about pushing the limits of what was possible. Jordan's relentless drive inspired his teammates and opponents alike. Players like Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman thrived under Jordan's leadership, and the Bulls became a dynasty, winning six championships in the 1990s.\n\nThe Global Impact of Air Jordan\n\nBeyond his on-court achievements, Jordan's impact extended to the global stage. His endorsement deal with Nike led to the creation of the Air Jordan brand, which became a cultural phenomenon. The Air Jordan sneakers were not just shoes; they were a statement of style and performance. Kids and adults alike wanted to 'Be Like Mike,' and the Air Jordan brand became a symbol of excellence and coolness.\n\nThe global reach of the Air Jordan brand helped popularize the NBA around the world. Basketball became more than just an American sport; it became a global phenomenon. Players from all over the world began to dream of playing in the NBA, and the league expanded its reach to new markets.\n\nThe Flu Game and Other Iconic Moments\n\nJordan's career is filled with iconic moments that have become part of basketball lore. One of the most famous is the 'Flu Game' during the 1997 NBA Finals. Despite being severely ill, Jordan scored 38 points, including a crucial three-pointer that helped the Bulls win the game and eventually the championship. This performance showcased Jordan's unmatched will to win and his ability to rise to the occasion when it mattered most.\n\nOther memorable moments include his game-winning shot against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 1989 playoffs, his 63-point performance against the Boston Celtics in the 1986 playoffs, and his final shot as a Bull in the 1998 NBA Finals. Each of these moments added to Jordan's legend and solidified his status as the greatest of all time.\n\nInfluence on the Next Generation\n\nJordan's impact on the NBA didn't end with his retirement. His influence continues to be felt through the next generation of players. Stars like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade have all cited Jordan as a major inspiration. They grew up watching Jordan and modeled their games after his. The competitive spirit, the work ethic, and the desire to be the best—these are all traits that Jordan passed down to the next generation.\n\nEven today, young players entering the league aspire to be like Jordan. They study his game, watch his highlights, and try to emulate his success. Jordan's legacy serves as a blueprint for what it takes to be a champion, both on and off the court.\n\nThe Jordan Brand and Business Acumen\n\nOff the court, Jordan's impact is just as significant. His business acumen and the success of the Jordan Brand have made him one of the wealthiest athletes in the world. The Jordan Brand, now a subsidiary of Nike, continues to be a major player in the sports apparel market. Jordan's involvement in the brand has ensured that it remains relevant and innovative, always pushing the boundaries of design and performance.\n\nJordan's success in business has also inspired other athletes to think beyond their playing careers. Players like LeBron James and Kevin Durant have followed Jordan's lead, investing in various ventures and building their own brands. Jordan's example has shown that athletes can be more than just players; they can be entrepreneurs and business leaders.\n\nThe Last Dance and Cultural Legacy\n\nThe release of 'The Last Dance' documentary in 2020 brought Jordan's legacy back into the spotlight. The series provided an in-depth look at Jordan's final season with the Bulls and offered insights into his competitive nature, leadership, and impact on the game. The documentary was a cultural phenomenon, drawing in both basketball fans and casual viewers alike.\n\nThrough 'The Last Dance,' a new generation of fans got to experience Jordan's greatness firsthand. The series highlighted not just his on-court achievements but also his cultural impact. It reminded viewers of Jordan's influence on fashion, music, and popular culture. The documentary solidified Jordan's status as a cultural icon and ensured that his legacy will continue to inspire future generations.\n\nCriticisms and Controversies\n\nOf course, no legend is without criticism. Jordan has faced his share of controversies and criticisms throughout his career. Some have questioned his leadership style, accusing him of being too harsh on his teammates. Others have criticized his gambling habits and his initial reluctance to speak out on social issues.\n\nHowever, despite these criticisms, Jordan's impact on the NBA remains undeniable. His competitive spirit, work ethic, and on-court achievements have left a lasting legacy that continues to inspire.

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nMichael Jordan's Effect on NBA Basketball: Was It a Good Thing?\n\nHis legacy is one of personified greatness.  His name has become  synonymous with being the best as it is not uncommon to use his it as a standard bearer of sorts.  His game was beautiful, elegant and graceful and it inspired an entire generation of children all over America to \"be like Mike.\"\n\nYes, Michael Jordan brought the NBA and basketball's popularity in general to new heights.  His ability to soar to the basket and do things we'd never before seen captured the world's attention and helped make basketball more of a global sport than it had ever been.  Unfortunately this came with a price.\n\nMichael Jordan made scoring sexy.  His reverse layups, slam dunks, and  fadeaway shots were exciting to say the least.  But as more and more of basketball's youth tried to emulate and  imitate their favorite No. 23, we started to see that  being like Mike was easier said than done.  And as that basketball youth grew, so did the me mentality that Michael Jordan unintentionally created.\n\nSuddenly, basketball became less about five guys playing with synergy and more about one guy trying to do it all himself.  One on one play became the new style of the NBA and of youthful basketball in America and as a result, the quality of play suffered.  The ball stopped moving, the fundamentals eroded, and the shot selection fell off the map.\n\nPlayers were faster and more athletic than ever before, but they were more athletes than basketball players.  All too often, player's only goal was to score, passing only when they had to.  The end result was lower overall scores in the NBA and a poor product on the floor.  The league even changed the rules, to open things up for offenses, akin to what the NFL did to protect receivers and quarterbacks and increase scoring.  While this succeeded in inflating the scores, it has only served as a crutch for unsound basketball.  Rather than teach unselfish basketball, they've chosen to reward selfish basketball even more with cheap fouls and lousy defense.\n\nIf you watch basketball from yesteryear, the first thing you'd notice (aside from the embarrassingly short shorts) is the ball movement; the quality of shots; and how easily the overall scores reach over 100.  This is not a result of each player being better than today's, but rather quite the opposite.  It would be fair to say that overall, the players of yesteryear were less skilled with only some exceptions.  But it is because of this that they worked better as a team, with each player depending on the next, and no one player dominating the ball.  Rather than each player trying to score on their own, the players passed the ball around and moved without the ball until they got the best possible shot.  This is what basketball is all about.\n\nUnfortunately, even some of today's best basketball players suffer from the \"be like Mike\" mentality.  As unselfish as LeBron James can be, he has shown almost an inability to play without the ball.  Rather than cut back door, or do something as simple as setting an off the ball screen, he does what most players of this generation do...nothing.  Without the ball, nothing.\n\nThe most ironic part of the \"be like Mike\" effect is that Michael Jordan was one of the most fundamentally sound players in history.  He was effective with and without the ball.  He set screens.  He passed with purpose more often than out of necessity.  And his shots, though seemingly difficult at times, were almost always balanced and under control.  Somehow, these aspects of his game were lost in translation, overshadowed by the flashier parts of his game.\n\nMichael Jordan's influence on basketball was greater than any other player in NBA history.  My question is...was it necessarily a good thing?  I'm not so sure.\n\n"

MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

His contributions on and off the court helped catapult the popularity of basketball to a new level -- one that now garners the attention of the world. Jordan and his trademark aerobatics are today an American icon, and have made him one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nBackground\n\nMichael Jeffery Jordan was born in Brooklyn, New York on Feb. 17, 1963. He attended high school in Wilmington, North Carolina, and subsequently attended the University of North Carolina, where he helped the Tar Heels win the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown 63-62 with a 16-foot jump shot. He was awarded The Sporting News' College Player of the Year award as a sophomore and junior. He was also the recipient of the Naismith and Wooden Awards his junior year.\n\nProfessional Career\n\nJordan left college his junior year after being drafted by the NBA's Chicago Bulls as the third overall pick in 1984. Upon returning from his gold-medal performance at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Jordan quickly made his presence known on the professional level, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Jordan went on to lead the Bulls to six NBA championships -- 1991-93 and 1996-98 -- and was named the league's most valuable player five times, in 1988, '91, '92, '96 and '98. He was also voted on to the NBA All-Star team 14 times. Jordan would return to the Olympic Games in 1992, where he again won the gold medal.\n\nPlaying Style\n\nJordan was regarded as one of the best one-on-one defenders to ever play the game, and was a threat from practically anywhere on the court. He was particularly known for his ability to hit medium-range shots, which greatly contributed to his all-time leading 30.1 points per game average. He finished with 32,292 career points. Perhaps the one trademark that catapulted Jordan to legend status were his aerobatic slam dunks that drew awe from fans and admiration from other players. His athletic ability earned him the nickname \"Air Jordan.\" The image of Jordan flying through the air with tongue sticking out has become an iconic symbol for basketball and an important marketing tool for Nike, whom Jordan has had a partnership with for many years.\n\nGlobalization of Basketball\n\nJordan's accomplishments on the court and his affable personal style made him the ideal poster child, not only for the NBA, but for basketball all around the world. His presence greatly impacted attendance at games, no matter if they were in Chicago -- attendance at Chicago Stadium rose 87 percent in 1984-85 -- or on the road, and sparked a global interest in the game. Jordan had a special clause in his contract, known as the \"love-of-the-game\" clause, which allowed him to play basketball in the off-season to help promote the sport.\n\nReferences\n\nWriter Bio\n\nDan Harriman began writing professionally in 2009 and has a varied background in marketing, ranging from sports management to music promotion.

Michael Jordan is one such a figure for he revolutionized basketball and arguably helped redefine how people view athletes and sports for the rest of the world. Legendary performances, and awards that almost can’t be numbered, Michael Jordan’s accomplishments over the course of his career would indeed include cultural impact far beyond the court. Champions of the Chicago Bulls, changing trends in fashion, marketing, and the global reach of the sport, he altered his legacy as uniquely as any other such person, Michael Jordan.\n\nThis paper traces how Michael Jordan reshapes the course of basketball and stamps his footprint permanently on the world of sports culture, that covers the Michael Jordan career and impacts lastingly.\n\nGrowing Up and The Road to Glory Michael’s education in basketball began when, famously, he did not make the varsity team as a sophomore. This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

Rebounds are also given to a player who tips in a missed shot on their team's offensive end. A rebound can be grabbed by either an offensive player or a defensive player.\n\nRebounds are divided into two main categories: \"offensive rebounds\", in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and \"defensive rebounds\", in which the defending team gains possession. The majority of rebounds are defensive because the team on defense tends to be in better position (i.e., closer to the basket) to recover missed shots. Offensive rebounds give the offensive team another opportunity to score whether right away or by resetting the offense. A block is not considered a rebound.\n\nA ball does not need to actually \"rebound\" off the rim or backboard for a rebound to be credited. Rebounds are credited after any missed shot, including air balls which completely miss the basket and board. If a player takes a shot and misses and the ball bounces on the ground before someone picks it up, then the person who picks up the ball is credited for a rebound. Rebounds are credited to the first player that gains clear possession of the ball or to the player that successfully deflects the ball into the basket for a score. A rebound is credited to a team when it gains possession of the ball after any missed shot that is not cleared by a single player (e.g., deflected out of bounds after the shot, blocked out of bounds, bounced directly off the rim out of bounds). A team rebound is never credited to any player, and is generally considered to be a formality as according to the rules of basketball, every missed shot must be rebounded whether a single player controls the ball or not.\n\nGreat rebounders tend to be tall and strong. Because height is so important, most rebounds are made by centers and power forwards, who are often positioned closer to the basket. The lack of height can sometimes be compensated by the strength to box out taller players away from the ball to capture the rebound. For example, Charles Barkley once led the league in rebounding despite usually being much shorter than his counterparts.\n\nSome shorter guards can be excellent rebounders as well such as point guard Jason Kidd who led the New Jersey Nets in rebounding for several years. But height can also be an advantage for rebounding. Great rebounders must also have a keen sense of timing and positioning. Great leaping ability is an important asset, but not necessary. Players such as Larry Bird and Moses Malone were excellent rebounders, but were never known for their leaping ability. Bird has stated, \"Most rebounds are taken below the rim. That's where I get mine\").[3]\n\nContents\n\nBoxing out\n\nPlayers position themselves in the best spot to get the rebound by \"boxing out\"—i.e., by positioning themselves between an opponent and the basket, and maintaining body contact with the player he is guarding. The action can also be called \"blocking out\". A team can be boxed out by several players using this technique to stop the other team from rebounding. Because fighting for a rebound can be very physical, rebounding is often regarded as \"grunt work\" or a \"hustle\" play. Overly aggressive boxing out or preventing being boxed out can lead to personal fouls.\n\nStatistics\n\nStatistics of a player's \"rebounds per game\" or \"rebounding average\" measure a player's rebounding effectiveness by dividing the number of rebounds by the number of games played. Rebound rates go beyond raw rebound totals by taking into account external factors, such as the number of shots taken in games and the percentage of those shots that are made (the total number of rebounds available).\n\nRebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1950–51 season. Both offensive and defensive rebounds were first officially recorded in the NBA during the 1973–74 season and ABA during the 1967–68 season.\n\nNew camera technology has been able to shed much more light on where missed shots will likely land.[4]\n\nNotable rebounders in the NBA\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLanguages\n\n"

            "raw_content": "What is a rebound in basketball?\n\nThe Basketball rebound: definition, technique and exercises\n\nThe missed shot is as much a part of basketball as the layup or even the legendary slam dunk. But what happens next? The rebound follows. In this article, we'll explain the difference between offensive and defensive rebounding, how to properly secure a rebound and how you can train rebounding both as a team and by yourself.\n\nWhat is a rebound in basketball?\n\nIn basketball, a rebound is the ball that bounces back after an unsuccessful basket attempt. The player who subsequently catches the ball (rebounding) is awarded the rebound.\n\nOn average, teams hit less than half of their shots in basketball. Even the best teams in the NBA rarely manage a shooting rate better than 50 percent. Once the ball hits the rim of board, whoever catches it just grabbed a rebound.\n\nYou often hearing talk of an offensive or defensive rebound, which refers to which team secures the ball:\r\n\nIf the offense grabs the ball, it's an offensive rebound. Despite a missed shot, the team now has another chance to score.\nIf the defending team grabs it, they secured a defensive rebound.\n\nWorth knowing: The best rebounders of the 2020/21 NBA season secured between 12 and 15 rebounds per game, which makes Wilt Chamberlain's performance all the more impressive: In 1960, he even managed 55 rebounds in a single game. That remains a record to this day. Over his entire career, he also grabbed the most rebounds in NBA history with 23,924.\n\nRebound training: basics, technique and workouts\n\nSize and jump height are very important for rebounding. However, those alone aren't enough to secure a rebound. The other aspect of a rebound in basketball comes down to technique. Let's first take a look at the basics for successful rebounding.\n\nRebound Basics\n\nOnly the interaction of different components enables you to regularly stand exactly where the ball lands and to reach it before your opponent. You should therefore train the following components specifically.\n\nJump height\n\nSure, the basket hangs at a height of 3.05 meters, and the ball flys upwards after a missed shot. The higher up you can get your hands on the leather, the better your chance of getting the rebound. Jump can compensate for a few missing centimeters.\n\nAnticipation, experience and positional play\n\nNot every ball bounces off the hoop in the same way and in the same direction. A three-pointer, for example, bounces further away than a shot from the center distance. If the ball hits the hoop after a high trajectory, it will also bounce higher, but shorter, than if it hits at a shallower angle. It is therefore important that you learn how the ball behaves so that you can position yourself accordingly. On the one hand, theoretical analysis helps, on the other hand, experience and precise observation. Rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, for example, even studied the way the ball rotates and how it affects his rebounding behaviour.\r\nIn this video clip, Rodman himself explains how he practised rebounding:\n\nUnboxing\n\nUnboxing - the favorite of almost every coach. Size and bounce alone do not guarantee a rebound in basketball. Dennis Rodman (career average: around 13 rebounds per game), for example, is one of the best rebounders in NBA history at \"only\" a good six feet. He made up for a lack of body length with an incredible feel for the path of the ball after a missed shot. He also had a talent for keeping his opponent fairly away from the ball: boxing out.\n\nBy cleverly placing yourself between the opponent and the basket, you'll block your opponent's path to the ball. Although you bend your knees, you make sure that even taller players can't simply reach over you. Because by bending forward slightly, you put more distance between the opponent and the ball.\n\nWillpower\n\nRebounding in basketball is work - and thus also serves as proof against the myth of basketball as a disembodied sport. Physicality dominates under the boards. If two players want to box out at the same time, friction occurs. There is a little pushing, but only within the rules. To hold your own there, even against bigger, stronger players, requires willpower.\n\nTiming\n\nJumping too early is no more helpful than still being on your knees when the ball has long since passed its highest point. Over time, you will develop a feeling for the right timing. So you jump off exactly when you can grab the rebound at the highest point for you personally. Because your own jumping abilities also play a central role.\n\nReactivity\n\nNo matter how well you anticipate, everything cannot be completely balanced in advance. Sometimes the ball hits the ring a few millimeters further down, so it bounces back toward the thrower instead of sliding straight forward. Other times, it claps back and forth inside the ring cylinder a few times, then falls toward the ground on one side. The faster you react in such cases, the higher the chance of the rebound.\n\nTechnique: 3 phases for a successful basketball rebound\n\nEvery rebound in basketball can be divided into three phases - and for each one, you can increase the chance of a successful rebound by keeping the following things in mind:\n\n1st phase - the flight of the ball\n\nThe work for the rebound does not start when the ball reaches the ring. Instead, immediately after it leaves the thrower's fingertips, you anticipate at what angle it might hit the ring and where.Accordingly, you move towards your position.\r\nFor the necessary stability, bend your knees slightly and take your opponent on your back, so to speak, for boxing out. First make contact with his chest and only then turn towards the basket. You should not actively hold him back with your arms. This will quickly lead to a foul whistle. Instead, raise your hands above shoulder height to shorten the way up when the ball bounces off the ring. It is important that you never position yourself statically, but always on the ball of the forefoot to remain mobile at all times.\n\n2nd phase - Rebounding the ball\n\nIf the ball bounces off the hoop, jump off at the right time. Aim to touch the ball with your hands at the highest point of your jump. To do this, raise both arms, as the two-handed basketball rebound makes it easier for you to secure the ball. You can reach a little higher if you first touch the ball with one hand and then with the other. Once you have secured the ball, pull it towards your chest while it is still in the air.\n\nPhase 3 - sticking the landing\n\nWhen landing, always make sure to bend your knees slightly and not to land stiffly. This protects the joints. To secure the ball after the rebound, spread your elbows outwards. However, do not swing them wildly back and forth. On the one hand, there is the danger of hitting the opponent in the head, and on the other hand, of committing a foul and having to give away the rebound you just secured.\n\nThen turn into the next movement - in the case of a defensive rebound, either a pass to the build-up player or your own dribbling towards the opponent's basket; in the case of an offensive rebound, a quick lay-up directly in the hoop. Make sure you do not lift your supporting leg. Otherwise you will make a step mistake. It is best to use the star step, where you only move with your free foot, to find a good angle for the next action.\n\n3 rebound exercises to improve your game\n\nThere are many aspects to rebounding. Technique, physicality and the mental aspect all play a role. At the same time, you can practice rebounding not only indidually but also as a team. Therefore, you can pick and choose the drill you need to improve your game.\n\nMental rebound training\n\nMental training has long had a footing in sports. Not only can it help with decision making but it can also increase your ability to concentrate. Both of these will definitely help with your basketball rebound. The more you can focus on the ball, its trajectory and the rebound angle, the better you can position yourself.\n\nRebound drills to do alone\n\nEven by yourself, there are plenty of ways to train effectively.\n\nOff the wall single hand catch\r\nAs safe as it would be to grab the ball directly with both hands, it actually makes more sense to grab the ball with one hand at first when rebounding. If you stretch the left hand a little further upwards, this allows a higher jump. As soon as you have one hand on the ball, immediately pull the other one up. This way you can reach for the ball at a higher point to secure it as quickly as possible afterwards.\n\nYou can practise this rebounding technique by throwing the basketball high against the wall of the house. From the rebounding position, jump up and grab it with one hand.\n\nOff the Wall Catch & Turn\r\nThe faster you turn after the rebound, the faster you can initiate the counter-attack, the fastbreak. To practise this turn, throw the basketball against the wall of the house as well. Instead of just jumping up and landing, you already turn in the air towards the imaginary other basket. A quarter turn is also enough to start with. Approach slowly and try it in both directions.\n\nOff the Wall Moving Catch\r\nSince the ball does not always bounce off the ring in the same way, do not always just stand directly in front of the wall. Try different angles and distances to prepare for rebounds that bounce different distances.\n\nReactive Bounce Catch\r\nA quick second or even third jump increases the chance of the rebound. Often, the ball does bounce directly form the rim to your hands. Zion Williamson, for example, is particularly good at this skill and often beats the opponent to the ball. To practise this movement, first hold the basketball in both hands. Now jump and slam the ball to the ground at the highest point of your jump. Once landed, jump off again to secure the rebound.\n\nWall Box Out Bounce & Catch\r\nBoxing out your opponents is a great option to help secure a rebound. However, make sure you don't push anyone - otherwise you'll draw a foul. Instead, use your arms like a shield to keep the opponents at a distance. You can even practise this at home.  Start by resting your forearm against the wall. With the other hand, bounce the basketball on the floor with pressure and then grab the rebound.\n\nRecommended: Also read up on basketball drills you can do at home.\n\nBasketball rebound drills as a team\n\nBoth the ball and the opponents are constantly moving. Communication and coordination are essential in basketball to win. This also applies to rebounding. Therefore, it's a good idea to do some rebounding exercises as a team.\n\nRotation-Rebounding\r\nThree or four offensive and three or four defensive players each run around the zone. The offense runs clockwise while the defense runs counterclockwise. As soon as the coach throws the ball, each defender looks for an offensive player to block out. Only then does the fight for the rebound begin. If the offensive team grabs the ball, it tries to score. If the defending team gets the rebound, they play to the opposite basket.\n\nSlide Rebounding\r\nSpacing - i.e. spreading the field by several distance shooters - against rebounding: The offence places itself around the three-point line, the defense lined up centrally in the zone between the baseline and the free-throw line. There, the defending players move from left to right and back again within the zone until the coach passes the ball to an offensive player and calls the name of a defender. The defender sprints towards the player with the ball, while his teammates have to find an offensive player to box out. It is important to communicate in such a way that everyone reaches an opponent as quickly as possible. After that, it is up to the defending team to secure the rebound.\n\nGolden Egg\r\nIn four pairs, the offense and defense places themselves around the circle at the free-throw line, with the defenders standing further inside. A basketball is placed in the middle. When called by the coach, the offensive players try to grab the ball by fair means, while the defenders do everything they can to stop them by boxing them out. If no offensive player has a hand on the basketball for five seconds, the defense has won and the next round is on. After a few rounds, you can switch roles.\n\nTo keep fit outside of basketball training, the best way to do this is to try indoors.\n\nBasketball rebound: definition and training tips\n\nCrucial basics, the right technique, forms of training for you alone and in a team - now you have everything you need to improve your rebounding in basketball. And to either use it to defend your own basket and get your offence going or to score quickly in attack after a missed shot by your team-mate. Possibly even with a dunk.\n\nOur tips on basketball attack and defense strategies will teach you the best way to set up your offense and defense Make sure you look the part with our customized basketball jerseys.\n\nImage Credits: Title Image: Drazen_/gettyimages; Image 2: NoSystem images/gettyimages; Image 3: South_agency/gettyimages; Image 4: gremlin /gettyimages; Image 5: technotr/gettyimages\n\nMore magazine articles\n\n"
