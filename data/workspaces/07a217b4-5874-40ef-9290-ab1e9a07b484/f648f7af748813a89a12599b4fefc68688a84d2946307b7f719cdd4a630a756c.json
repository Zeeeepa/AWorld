        "raw_content": "Has LeBron James ever won Defensive Player of the Year? A closer look at the four-time champion's accolades\n\nThroughout his 21-year NBA career, LeBron James has racked up individual and team awards. He ranks among the most talented and highly decorated players to set foot on a basketball court in the NBA and international competition.\n\nHowever, for all of his accomplishments throughout his career, there seems to be one award that has eluded him thus far. That award is the Hakeem Olajuwon trophy, better known as the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nAt this point in his career, LeBron has yet to win the NBA's DPOY, which is perhaps the only individual accomplishment he has yet to add to his trophy collection. However, he has come close several times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nTwice in his career, he finished the season as the runner-up for this particular award. The first time was in 2009 when he came in behind Dwight Howard. The then-Orlando Magic Center ended up with 105 first-place votes while LeBron James came in second at 4 votes.\n\nThe second time LeBron came in second in DPOY voting was in 2013. Marc Gasol ended up winning with 30 first-place votes while LeBron James finished with 18.\n\nDespite never winning the DPOY award, he has been named to five NBA All-Defensive First teams from 2009 to 2013 and an NBA All-Defensive Second team in 2014.\n\nAlso read: LeBron James dons driving gloves for 1am drive after getting swept by Kings\n\n\n\nTaking a look at LeBron James' other awards\n\nWhile he's never been the NBA's DPOY, LeBron James has won plenty of accolades. He started his career strong by winning the NBA's Rookie of the Year award in 2004 over Carmelo Anthony and from there, the awards only kept rolling in.\n\nIn his second season in the league (2004-05), he was already named to the first of his three All-NBA Second Teams. The two other times were in 2007 and 2021. He has also been on the All-NBA Third Team three times and a part of the All-NBA First Team 13 times.\n\nHe has also been an All-Star from 2005 through 2024 and has earned the All-Star MVP award three times (2006, 2008, 2018).\n\nLeBron also won the scoring title in 2008 and has since then taken over as the league's best scorer. He is the first and only player so far to ever score over 40,000 career points and he's not done yet. He has also validated his status as an elite playmaker by being the league's assists leader in 2020.\n\nPerhaps some of the most prestigious awards in LeBron's trophy case are the four NBA MVPs he won in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013. As well as the four Finals MVPs he's earned alongside each one of his four NBA titles in 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2020 with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers and the LA Lakers.\n\nHe's also earned his place among the league's greatest athletes of all time as a part of the NBA 75th Anniversary team.\n\nWhile LeBron James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year, he has certainly amassed an impressive collection of other awards.\n\nMiguel de Guzman\n\nMiguel is a basketball writer at Sportskeeda with an overall experience of 7 years. A lover of the sport owing to its mental aspect, he has played it throughout high school and college as a power forward and small forward, and has also coached high school and college basketball teams. These experiences have given him a unique perspective on the game, which translates into insightful content.\n\nFor Miguel, the San Antonio Spurs, especially during the Tim Duncan era, were the embodiment of team basketball. He respects Gregg Popovich's empathy toward his players and his understanding of the game.

        "raw_content": "Listing LeBron James' Top 3 finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award\n\nMany believe LeBron James is still the best player in the NBA today, even in his 19th campaign.\n\nJames is an incredible all-around player who can score with ease and is also good at distributing the basketball after he's attracted the defense's entire attention. He is a solid passer, and many consider him one of the best ever in that aspect of the game.\n\nMoreover, 'The King' has been a solid defender throughout his career. He has used his physicality and his basketball IQ effectively, especially during fastbreaks for the opposing team, or during big moments down the stretch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn't always guarded the opposing team's best player in the clutch, but James was a great defender during his best days. And he's still able to produce great displays on that end of the court, even at age 37.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James' top three finishes in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting\n\nOne of the biggest notions seen in the NBA about LeBron James is that he was 'robbed' of the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year award won by Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol.\n\nJames was more than extraordinary in 2012-13, putting up arguably his greatest display of talent for the 66-16 Miami Heat. Miami had a 27-game winning streak at one point and went on to win the title after a dramatic 2013 Finals against the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nJames won the MVP award and finished second in the DPOY in what was perhaps his best chance to win that award in his career. However, he's had some other extraordinary seasons, even backed by advanced stats.\n\nIn this article, we will look into those seasons and rank James' top three finishes in the DPOY award voting.\n\nNo. 3: 2011-12 season | 4th\n\nLeBron James has finished in the top five of the Defensive Player of the Year award voting five times. He was fourth in 2011-12, when he was named the Most Valuable Player.\n\nThat year, James led the NBA in Player Efficiency Rating, Defensive Box Plus/Minus, finished second in Defensive Win Shares and put up the best Defensive Rating of his career so far, with a 97.\n\nHe was fourth in the DPOY voting with seven first-place votes and 112 points, behind Tyson Chandler, Serge Ibaka and Dwight Howard.\n\nNo. 2: 2008-09 season | 2nd\n\nThe 2008-09 season saw James win the first MVP award of his illustrious career. And he came close to winning the DPOY award as he finished second behind Orlando Magic's Dwight Howard.\n\nJames' Cleveland Cavaliers put up the league's best record in the regular season at 66-16, while LeBron led the league in PER, was second in Defensive Win Shares, second in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and third in Defensive Rating.\n\nAlthough he finished second in DPOY voting, James really did not have a chance to win as Howard had 105 first-place votes against James' four.\n\nNo. 1: 2012-13 season | 2nd\n\nAlthough 2012-13 ended tremendously for James and his Miami Heat, with an NBA title, the MVP and the Finals MVP award, the Defensive Player of the Year award escaped from James' hands, controversially.\n\nJames was the favorite in the eyes of many, only to be robbed instead. Marc Gasol won the trophy, and James' best chance to win the DPOY ended with another second place.\n\nGasol grabbed 30 first-place votes, and James was second with 18. However, advanced stats do not really show it was a great defensive year for James. But he was in the top 10 in Defensive Win Shares and Defensive Box Plus/Minus.\n\nMoreover, the eye test truly showed James dominated during the 2012-13 season, whether on offense or on defense. Teams tried to stay away from him defensively. Only Indiana Pacers forward Paul George was arguably as impactful on defense as James was.\n\nSince the 2012-13 season, James has finished in the top five of the DPOY voting only once (2016-17).\n\nAlso read: “Michael Jordan came up in the era where everybody hated each other, they did not f*** with each other” – Al Harrington says LeBron James can’t dominate an era like Michael Jordan\n\nVictor R.

James was also named the men's basketball tournament MVP and the Summer Olympics All-Star First Team.\n\nIt was the LA Lakers star's third Olympic gold medal and fourth overall, winning bronze in 2004. He won gold at the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Olympics. He skipped the 2016 Rio de Janeiro and 2020 Tokyo games before returning this year after Team USA's fourth-place finish in the 2023 FIBA World Cup.\n\nApart from four Olympic medals and one tournament MVP, James won a bronze for Team USA in the 2006 FIBA World Cup and a gold in the 2007 FIBA Americup. He was also a two-time USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year in 2008 and 2012. There's a good chance he could win that award again this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - High School\n\nBefore getting to the NBA, LeBron James was the most hyped high school basketball player in history.\n\nHe famously got a cover story from Sports Illustrated in 2002, where he was called \"The Chosen One.\" He has lived up to the hype but already had many accomplishments in high school for St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, Ohio.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nLeBron James Trophies and Achievements - NBA\n\nLeBron James will likely end up with the greatest career in NBA history due to his longevity and durability.\n\nJames' greatness shone when he entered the league out of his school, and he continues to impress as the oldest player in the NBA. He won the Rookie of the Year out of the gate before moving up the ladder and cementing his legacy.\n\nHere are all the awards won by James in his career so far:\n\nApart from his accomplishments, LeBron James also holds a lot of NBA records in the regular season and playoffs.\n\nHe's the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and the only player to reach 40,000 points. He's also fourth in assists, second in minutes played, second in field goals made and the first in 20-point games.\n\nJames is even better in the playoffs, as he has the most points, field goals made, free throws made, steals, minutes played, games played, defensive rebounds and consecutive games scoring. If he continues to play into his 40s and makes the postseason, he will likely also be atop the assists and possibly triple-doubles leaderboards too.\n\nJuan Paolo David\n\nJuan Paolo is a journalist for Sportskeeda who covers the NBA and WNBA. He's been writing about basketball since 2015 and has been with Sportskeeda since 2021.\n\nJuan's allegiance lies with the Golden State Warriors and his journey with the Warriors began with their memorable victory over the Lakers in 2000, and he experienced the successes of the 'We Believe' era and the rise of Steph Curry. \n\nWhat Juan loves most about basketball is its ability to evoke a range of emotions, from adrenaline-fueled excitement to the highs of victory and the lows of defeat. To ensure complete accuracy in articles, he conducts thorough research before writing his articles.\n\nThe Warriors' victories in the 2022 and 2017 championships hold a special place in Juan's memories, as well as iconic moments like Baron Davis' dunk over Andrei Kirilenko and Goran Dragic's performance in the 2010 Western Conference semifinals.\n\nOff the court, Juan enjoys watching football, TV and movies, caring for his numerous cats, and cooking whenever time permits.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?
