Combined, he has scored 49,999 points in NBA games.\n\nHe will hit a milestone on Tuesday night: 50,000 points scored, regular season and playoffs combined. It’s a total nobody else is within 5,000 points of reaching, a truly historic number that will become part of his legacy. Here is everything you need to know about LeBron’s milestone.\n\nHow many career points does LeBron James have?\n\nLeBron is the NBA’s all-time leader in regular season points scored at 41,837 — he is the only player in the league’s history with more than 40,000 regular season points. LeBron has scored 8,162 points in the playoffs, also more than anyone else in the history of the league.\n\nCombined, that is 49,999 points.\n\nWhen will LeBron James break 50,000 career points?\n\nMost likely in the opening minutes of the Lakers game at home Tuesday night against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nLeBron, who is averaging 24.8 points a game this season, needs just one point to hit the milestone. You can be sure Luka Doncic and every other Laker knows it and will be feeding LeBron the rock early.\n\nLeBron James vs Kareem Abdul Jabbar career points\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar has to be in any NBA GOAT conversation and owned a record that seemed unreachable: 38,387 points scored in regular season games.\n\nOn Feb. 7, 2023, with Abdul-Jabbar looking on in the building, LeBron passed Kareem for the most points in NBA history with a fadeaway jumper.\n\n38,388 POINTSLeBron James hits the fadeaway jumper to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer! #ScoringKing pic.twitter.com/P5LyTZAZn3\n\nIt was an iconic moment for LeBron and a big part of his GOAT case—he has played longer at a high level than any player in NBA history. His reaching 50,000 points in regular-season and playoff games adds to that resume.\n\nNBA all-time scoring list (regular season and playoffs)\n\nHere is the NBA all-time scoring list, counting both regular season and playoff games:\n\n1.

Dan Issel 30,416\n\nLeBron James career stats, awards and record\n\nLeBron’s resume is mind-boggling:\n\n• Four-time NBA champion• Four-time MVP• 20-time All-NBA player (that will become 21 after this season)• 21-time All-Star• Siix-time All-Defensive team• Won the league’s scoring title in 2008\n\nOver the course of 22 seasons, he has averaged 27 points, 7.5 points, and 7.4 rebounds a game while shooting 50.7% (including 35% from 3). LeBron also has won three Olympic gold medals with USA Basketball, most recently last summer in the Paris Olympics.\n\nWhat other records can LeBron break?\n\nAs impressive as that resume — and scoring 50,000 points — is, there are a couple of other records LeBron could set before he hangs up his Nikes.\n\nLeBron is currently third in regular season games played in NBA history at 1,547, which is 13 behind Abdul-Jabbar for second (1,560). Celtics legend and Hall of Famer Robert Parish has the most games played at 1,611, a number LeBron could pass next season if he plays and remains mostly healthy.\n\nMichael Jordan holds the record for most 30+ point games in NBA history at 562, but LeBron is just two short of tying that number.\n\nA Division of NBCUniversal.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This site and the products offered are for entertainment purposes only, and there is no gambling offered on this site.

In his 21-year career, LeBron James has never shown signs of slowing down. Looking at his recent seasons, it almost seems like he has just reached his peak.\n\nLeBron James entered the NBA as the first overall pick in the 2003 Draft, and from there, he became a four-time MVP and a perennial All-Star, ranking second in both All-Star selections and games played. He is the first player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a record that will likely remain unbeaten for decades. Moreover, on February 8, 2023, he became the all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nThe debate over the greatest of all time has never been as heated as it has been since 2012, the year of his first NBA championship. Since then, LeBron James has climbed the pyramid, surpassing other legends such as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Wilt Chamberlain.\n\nToday, we present to you all of LeBron James’ statistics for the Regular Season and Playoffs, indicating his position in the all-time rankings for each category.\n\nConsidering LeBron’s desire to play alongside his two sons, Bronny and Bryce, what other records will “The Chosen One” be able to break?\n\nLeBron James Stats\n\nStats | Regular Season | Playoffs\nGames Played | 7° (1.506) | 1° (287)\nMinutes Played | 1°(57,446) | 1° (11.654)\nMinutes per Game | 15° (37,17) | 13° (41,0)\nTotal Points | 1° (40.803) | 1° (8.162)\nPoints per Game | 6° (27,20) | 6° (28,5)\nPoints in a Single Game | 43° (61) | 20° (51)\nTotal Assists | 4° (11.141) | 2° (2.067)\nAssists per Game | 24° (7,40) | 16° (7,20)\nAssists in a Single Game | ND (19) | 77° (16)\nTotal Rebounds | 28° (11.315) | 6° (2.348)\nRebounds per Game | 182° (7,5) | 80° (9,03)\nTotal Blocks | 84° (1.109) | 10° (252)\nBlocks per Game | 238° (0,76) | 114° (0,96)\nTotal Steals | 10° (2.255) | 1° (454)\nSteals per Game | 68° (1,57) | 26° (1,71)\nField Goals Made | 2° (14.670) | 1° (2.857)\nThree-Pointers Made | 10° (2.381) | 2° (456)\nFree Throws Made | 4° (8.296) | 1° (1.813)\nTriple Doubles | 4° (110) | 2° (28)\nGames with 20+ Points | 1° (1220) | 1° (237)\nLeBron James’ Top Plays of the Decade\n\nLeBron James Awards\n\nAward | Title\nNBA champion | 4\nMVP | 4\nMVP Finals | 4\nNBA CUP | 1\nNBA In-Season Tournament MVP | 1\nAll NBA | 13x First Team3x Second Team1x Third Team\nNBA All Defensive | 5x First Team1x Second Team\nAll Star | 20\nAll Star Game MVP | 3\nRookie of the Year | 1\nTop Scorer | 1\nMore playing time | 3\nBest assistman | 1\nOlympic titles | 2 Gold, 1 Bronze\nFIBA World Cup | 1 Bronze\nFIBA AmeriCup | 1 Gold\nUn post condiviso da Dunkest (@dunkest)\n\nLeBron James Records\n\nHis resume is so full of accolades and broken records that we could fill a 200-page book.
