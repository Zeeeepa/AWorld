The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

So this group of Bulls stands as not only the best Bulls team of the Jordan era but the greatest team of all time.\n\nThey won 86.7 percent of all games they played, a ridiculous percentage that places them among the most dominant teams in any major U.S. pro sport. This was the fourth Bulls championship, earned in the first full season after Michael Jordan returned from his mid-90s “retirement.” They had winning streaks of 13 and 18 games and only once lost consecutive games, to the Nuggets and Suns on an early February trip West.\n\nThey won 14 of their first 15 games in the playoffs, and the loss to the Knicks came in overtime. Of the 15 postseason victories necessary to claim the NBA title, 10 came by double-digit margins.\n\n2. 1996-97\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nAlthough there is no question the 1996 team was superior, coming back a year later and nearly matching that performance might was, at its essence, even more impressive. Jordan and Pippen ranked among the top 20 in the league in minutes, even though each already had four championship rings. Toni Kukoc’s versatility off the bench continued to escalate. He ranked third on the team in shots and scoring and second in assists, behind Pippen. They opened the season with a 12-game winning streak, an amazing feat given this was a team that knew very well the championship was not going to be won in November.\n\n3. 1991-92\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the year of Jordan’s famous shrug, a gesture during Game 1 of the Finals series with the Blazers that underscored not only a moment, but an era. It was an acknowledgment that, indeed, even he could not believe he’d gotten so good. He earned 80 of a possible 96 first-place votes for MVP, 93.8 percent of a perfect score.\n\nCartwright missed 18 games because of injury but was back for a strong run in the playoffs, when he averaged 28 minutes, including a challenging matchup with Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing in which Ewing shot 8-of-19 from the field in the decisive game.\n\n4. 1990-91\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was not a strong year for the NBA overall, still absorbing the expansion by four teams in the previous three years. Detroit’s Bad Boys were showing wear and won only 50 games. The team with the best record in the league, the Trail Blazers, proved not ready for the spotlight and fell easily to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Bulls had to surmount mental hurdles to at last win a championship with Jordan on their side. Most notable among those was getting past the Pistons, but they also had to conquer a Lakers team accustomed to winning titles (but not used to doing it without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). John Paxson’s 44 percent shooting from 3-poit range and Horace Grant’s growth into a 34-minute player were essential to the breakthrough.\n\n5. 1997-98\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThe injury that kept Pippen out at the beginning of “The Last Dance” season led to him starting only 44 games to Kukoc’s 52. By the time they Bulls were back to the playoffs, they were again using the rotation similar to what worked so beautifully the previous two years, albeit with Kukoc frequently filling Rodman’s spot as a starter.\n\nEven with Pippen missing for so long, the controversy regarding the declaration by Bulls management that Jackson would not return the following season and the distraction of Jordan constantly being asked about his future plans, the team still managed to tie the Jazz for best record in the league. It was another example of Jordan and the Bulls demonstrating that when it would be easy to relax – explicable, even – they still discovered the motivation to push through toward greatness.\n\nThere never was a \"Super Bowl hangover\" with Jordan's Bulls. Their Finals series against Utah was the most competitive of the six title teams; five of the six games were decided by two or fewer possessions. The title was won on a Jordan step-back jumper that has become among the most iconic shots in the game’s history.\n\n6. 1992-93\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the only Bulls title team that didn’t reach the 60-win plateau, with the offense fading and more reliant on Jordan than at any point during the team’s championship run. Cartwright needed more help from Scott Williams to man the middle. They essentially split time at the center spot, and together they produced a double-figure rebound average.\n\nThere was a shaky moment in the conference finals against the blossoming Knicks, who rode the tough-guy front line Ewing, Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley to 60 victories and the No. 1 seed in the East. The Bulls lost the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, then blew out the Knicks in the next two games to remind them what they were facing in challenging this dynasty.\n\nThe closest the Bulls came to losing a championship arrived then, with each having won two games and the Bulls ahead by a point with 20 seconds remaining. Forward Charles Smith got the ball inside and had four attempts to make a game-winning layup, but all were challenged and/or blocked by Bulls defenders. That was it for the Knicks. No one ever came so close again to eliminating a full-strength Jordan/Bulls team.\n\nMike DeCourcy\n\nMike DeCourcy has been the college basketball columnist at The Sporting News since 1995.

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nMichael Jordan: Why He's a 6-Time Finals MVP, 6-for-6 Champion and G.O.A.T.\n\nMichael Jordan is the only player in NBA history to never score less than 20 points in any of his Finals games but that is just one reason that every time the greatest player ever never once let his team lose in the Finals and was named Finals MVP all six times.\n\nThe truth is that although he did record the best Finals and playoff stats of any player ever it was that he was never a sidekick and he took control of every single Finals game he played in and JUST ABSOLUTELY REFUSED to let his team lose a Finals series, which no one else can really say (Duncan is 4 for 4). He never even let it get to seven games - not even once, which is sick.\n\nWilt lost in the Finals numerous times, Russell lost in the 18=958 Finals, Bird lost in the Finals, Erving lost in the Finals, West lost in the Finals, Shaq lost in the Finals (2004) and Kobe lost in the Finals twice (2004 and 2008), Kareem lost in the Finals and Magic lost in the Finals, including against MJ himself.\n\nWhy is Jordan the greatest. His stats? Yep. 10 time scoring champion? Yep. Defensive Player of the Year? Yep. Five time NBA MVP? Yep. Perfection in the Finals with 6 MVP's? Yep and Yep.\n\nHere we see why no one can can in this guys rare air.\n\nMan you should'a seen this kids! Yo, this was straight sick. MJ went up against Magic and went out and busted through with four straight wins to take his first title.\n\nThe fabled Lakers couldn't hang with this one man. Don't even try the Pippen statement. Believe me, I was there dude. Pippen could do nothing on his own and he actually kinda sucked, except on defense. But Jordan was just dirty with it. He scored and passed better than Magic himself and averaged over 10 assists and 30 points. WTF?\n\nIn game one he scored 36 points had eight rebounds, 12 assists and three steals.\n\nIn game two he scored 33 points on 15/18 shooting, seven rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a block.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 29 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, four steals and two blocks.\n\nIn game four he scored 28 points, dished off for 13 assists and had five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nIn the closer MJ had 30 points, 10 assists and five steals.\n\nCan't hate on that. That is the GOAT right there.\n\n6'7\" Drexler was in his all-around prime and the Portlans team had way more options than Chicago who had uh....Michael Jordan.\n\nHe showed what was up in the first 24 minutes of the series. No one, even if they were bigger, heavier or stronger ever could or did stop him. Did they? Nope.\n\nIn game one he scored 39 points in 34 minutes and added 11 assists, but the six threes before halftime is the most exciting half in Finals history. 35 points at halftime is still a Finals record beeatches!\n\nIn game two MJ had 39 points and 10 assists.\n\nIn game three Jordan scored 26 and had seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 32 and added five rebounds and six assists.\n\nIn game five MJ went off on 14/23 from the field and 16/19 from the line and 2/3 from threes and schooled for 46 points.\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 33 points, had four steals, four rebounds and four assists and one block.\n\nTotally unstoppable man.\n\nAll MJ went out and did was record the highest scoring average in a Finals series ever with 41.0 ppg. Yep, let's see anyone in the league today be that dirty in the Finals. IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nJust put it this way: Game one 31 points, game two 42 points, game three 44 points, game four 55 points, game five 41 points and in the closer 33 points versus Barkley, Ainge, KJ, Chambers and Majerle.\n\nYes, that was FOUR STRAIGHT FINALS GAMES WITH OVER 40 POINTS. Get yourselves a reality check people. I saw every game MJ was obviously the best player in history and Pippen wasn't really that awesome in this series. Get it real: MJ is the only reason they won against a superior team.\n\nMan, this guy was greater at age 32-33 than any player ever. He had come out of retirement in 1995 and led the Bulls to a 13-4 record to finish the 1994-95 season but the Bulls didn't make it to the Finals. MJ was rusty really, after not playing for 18 months.\n\nSo he said to himself and his teammates - watch this!\n\nHe proceeded to lead his team to the greatest single season in NBA history with a 72-10 regular season record.\n\nIn game one of the Finals MJ scored 28 points and added seven rebounds.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 29 points and added six rebounds, eight assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 36 and had five assists and two steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 23 but the rest of the Bulls were actually on fire.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 26 points and added four rebounds.\n\nIn the closer MJ and the Bulls won so easily that MJ only needed to score 22, which is the least points he has ever scored in the Finals.\n\nPayton and Kemp could stop every one but not MJ.\n\nThe Bulls were led by 34 year old Michael to the second best record in NBA history with a 69-13 record. They have the top place too with 72-10. Over two season MJ led them to 141 wins and 23 loss record.\n\nMJ was there for every game and led the NBA in scoring both times, shooting 50%.\n\nIn game one of the Finals vs Stockton and Malone and Hornacek -  MJ scored 31 points and added eight assists.\n\nIn game two he scored 38 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three he scored 26 points and had six assists.\n\nIn game four MJ scored a game high for either team with 22 points.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 38 points (he was sick that day too).\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 39 points and added 11 rebounds.\n\nMan, this dude was 34 and schooling these guys still. Jordan will not be topped we was that freaking great.\n\nAt age 35 MJ became the oldest MVP and scoring champion ever.\n\nHe also led the Bulls to a 62-20 record and took them to face Utah again.\n\nIn game one MJ had 33 points.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 37.\n\nIn game three he had 24 points in 32 minutes, because the Bulls were SO ahead.\n\nIn game four MJ scored 34 and added eight rebounds and two steals.\n\nIn game five Jordan scored 28 and had three steals.\n\nIn his last ever Finals game (cuz he retired again after this one) Jordan scored 45 points! One of his four steals led to him hitting the greatest and most famous and momentous last shot of a Finals series ever.\n\nThey way he held his hand in the air was so cool. No one left has such style.\n\nThere are over 100 reasons I can think of to explain how MJ is the greatest player who cannot be passed, especially by any player in the NBA today, but the whole point of this story is to show one thing.\n\nYes, there are player of great will and desire like Kobe, but Kobe lost in the Finals in 2004 and 2008. If Jordan was on the 2004 Lakers they would have won for damn sure. The 2004 Pistons would get stomped by the 1991 Pistons and the Lakers lost to them 4-1.\n\nKobe didn't do anything to make them win (and he had Malone, Shaq and Payton on his team so there's no excuse for losing), so he aint even in the conversation. In 2008 the Lakers lost even though they had Gasol. MJ never had a center worth much, but he never lost anyway.\n\nPut prime Jordan on the 2008 Lakers and they'd be champs for sure. You know how I know? MJ NEVER ONCE LOST IN THE FNALS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat is why Jordan is the greatest ever: they all lost and he didn't.\n\nLebron? Nope.\n\nWade? Nope.\n\nCarmelo? Nope.\n\nHoward? Nope.\n\nRose? Nope.\n\nDurant? Nope.\n\nKobe? Nope.\n\nMJ is the GOAT and you must accept it in order to be happy.\n\n"

Of those 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls for 13 (1984-93; 1995-98) and the Washington Wizards for a couple (2001-03).\n\nWhile he did record remarkable numbers for a player closer to 40 than 35, he was clearly in the twilight of his career with the WIzards. His greatest years came with the Bulls, predominantly in the 1990s when he led the franchise to six championships in as many Finals appearances over eight years.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at when Jordan won each of his six NBA titles, the numbers he put up in those seasons and the teams he beat en route to those championships:\n\n1991\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1991 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 31.5 points (1st in NBA), 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.7 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a conference-best 61-21 regular-season record (2nd in NBA). In the playoffs, Jordan averaged 31.1 points, 8.4 assists, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals as the Bulls dropped just two games en route to their first-ever title, with both losses only coming by two points.\n\nThe most iconic moment of this championship series came in Game 2 when Jordan pulled 'the spectacular move' by switching from a dunk to a left-handed layup mid-air:\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1992 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 30.1 points (1st in NBA), 6.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a league-best 67-15 record. It was the first time in franchise history that the Bulls had recorded the league's best regular-season record.\n\nIn the playoffs, this time around, the Bulls faced a lot more competition. Dropping seven games in the 1992 postseason, Jordan led the Bulls with playoff averages of 34.5 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.0 steals. With this title, the Bulls, at that time, became only the third franchise after the Lakers and the Celtics to win back-to-back championships.\n\nMORE: How Jordan dominated Drexler in the 1992 Finals\n\nWhile there were plenty of other notable 'Jordan' moments in this postseason run, including a 54-point Game 4 performance against the Knicks, arguably the most memorable is the Shrug Game - Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n#OTD: The Shrug GameMichael Jordan sets #NBAFinals record for points (35) & threes (6) in a half in Game 1 of the 1992 #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/C73Gs4T8hQ\n\n1993\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1993 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 32.6 points (1st in NBA), 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals (1st in NBA), Jordan led the Bulls to a 57-25 record (3rd in NBA).\n\nIn the quest to become only the second franchise since the Celtics of the 1960s to win three straight titles, Jordan averaged a playoff career-high 35.1 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.1 steals.\n\nDuring the 1993 postseason, he recorded two 50-point games including a 55-point masterpiece in Game 4 of the Finals:\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1996 NBA Championship:\n\nPlaying his first full season since 1993, when he led the Bulls to a 3-peat, Jordan averaged 30.4 points (1st in NBA), 6.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals. He led the Bulls to a league-best 72-10, then an NBA record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\n\nIn the postseason, Jordan averaged 30.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.8 steals as the Bulls dropped just one game en route to the Finals. In the championship series, they quickly jumped to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and SuperSonics. While Sonics retaliated and won two straight, Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\n1997\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1997 NBA Championship:\n\nFor the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as he played all 82 games. Coming off the NBA record 72 wins, the Bulls finished with a league-best 69-13 record.\n\nJust like the regular season, the Bulls breezed past the East in the playoffs and were set to face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. In the extremely competitive series, that saw an average winning margin of just six points, the defending champions came out on top.\n\n\n\nJordan averaged 31.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 steals in the playoffs. More notably, in the Finals - Game 5 to be precise - he had one of the most iconic and memorable games of his career - 'The Flu Game'.\n\n\n\nBattling the Flu, Jordan finished with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 44 minutes on the court.\n\n1998\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1998 NBA Championship:\n\nComing off 72 and 69 wins in the previous two years, the Bulls kept the momentum rolling. They tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best record of 62-20 as Jordan averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists while playing all 82 games.\n\nThe Bulls cruised past the first two rounds but in the Conference Finals, just for the second time in the Bulls championship seasons, they were taken to a Game 7 by the Indiana Pacers. After narrowly beating them, they were set for a rematch with the Jazz but this contest ended in six games as well.\n\nMORE: The most underappreciated play of MJ's career\n\nJordan ended his Bulls career with one of the best sequences of his career - a steal on Malone followed by the game-winner over Byron Russell.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nYash Matange\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\nPartners\n\n"

          "raw_content": "NBA Champions by Year: Complete History and Results of the NBA Finals\n\nJoe Lago | Apr 7, 2025\n\nBasketball's most cherished records are set in the regular season, but the playoffs is where lasting legacies are created.\n\nEach National Basketball Association season culminates in the NBA Finals, which determine the season's champion between the winners of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference. The best-of-seven game series finale also serves as the stage for players and teams to carve their places in hoops history.\n\nThe Origins of the NBA Finals\n\nThe NBA recognizes its first champion as the winner of the six-team Basketball Association of America, which began in 1947. The Philadelphia Warriors defeated the Chicago Staggs 4-1 and clinched the title behind Hall of Famer Joe Fulks, who scored 21 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5.\n\nThe Finals format of determining a champion in a first-to-four-victories series was modeled after Major League Baseball's World Series, which was the brainchild of John T. Brush. The New York Giants principal owner proposed a best-of-seven games contest between the American League and National League champs, and the \"Brush Rules\" were adopted in February 1905.\n\nThe BAA played its games in major venues, such as Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium, but the best players competed in the National Basketball League. After the NBL's four best teams joined the BAA before the 1948-49 season, the competitors merged in 1949 to create a new pro basketball leagueâthe NBA.\n\nWhen the NBA expanded from 10 to 12 teams in 1968, the basketball market in America had room for a new upstart league in the American Basketball Association. The ABA promoted a flashy, high-scoring brand of hoops, including the three-point shot, but in 1976, the league folded with four of its teams joining the NBA â Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEvery NBA Champion in History\n\nGeorge Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers won the first NBA Finals in 1950, defeating the Syracuse Nationals 4-2. The Lakers featured Hall of Famers in Mikan, Jim Pollard, Slater Martin and Vern Mikkelsen, and with the 6'10\" Mikan, they dominated defensively on their narrow home court at Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nMinneapolis would win three more NBA Finals before the league's defining dynasty took over.\n\nIn 1957, the Boston Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks 4-3 to capture their first-ever NBA championship. Under legendary coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won 10 more league crowns over the next 12 seasons. Bill Russell served as the inspirational leader and defensive anchor for all 11 title teams and is the record holder for most NBA championships by a player.\n\nThe Celtics enjoyed another run of success in the 1980s, but it coincided with the emergence of a new Lakers dynasty in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson rivalry that elevated college basketball to new heights had the same game-changing impact on the NBA. The two all-time greats faced off in some of the league's most memorable Finals battles and combined for eight championships in the 80sâJohnson outdueling Bird 5-3 in Larry O'Brien Trophy wins.\n\nMore dynasties would rule the NBA.\n\nIn the 1990s, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls achieved not one but two three-peats by winning three consecutive titles from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998. Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors ushered in a new era of prioritizing the three-pointer when they won the 2015 crown, the first of four championships in an eight-year period.\n\nThe Celtics have won the most NBA titles with 18, one more than the Lakers. The Warriors rank third with seven championships. The Bulls and Spurs have won six and five NBA crowns, respectively.\n\nYear | Winning Team | Losing Team | Series Result | Finals MVP\n1947 | Philadelphia Warriors | Chicago Stags | 4-1 | \n1948 |

in NBA Finals History\n\nThe NBA's all-time greats each have produced an iconic Finals moment that lives on in the memories of basketball fans and in perpetuity on YouTube. The most celebrated plays are the clutch shots that helped their teams secure the championship.\n\nArguably the most iconic shot in NBA history is Michael Jordan's 20-foot jumper that clinched the Bulls' 1998 title against the Utah Jazz. Expected to retire after the series, the 34-year-old Jordan scored on a layup to cut Chicago's deficit to one point, stole the ball from Karl Malone and then crossed over Bryon Russell to bury the go-ahead basket with 5.2 seconds left.\n\nJordan walked away from basketball (temporarily) after winning his sixth NBA championship.\n\nLeBron James, who shares the \"Greatest of All Time\" status with Jordan, has his own Finals highlight with the most historic display of championship-level defense for his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIn Game 7 of perhaps the greatest NBA Finals ever against the record-setting 73-win Warriors in 2016, James chased down Andre Iguodala to block his layup attempt and keep the score tied at 89 with less than two minutes remaining. Kyrie Irving's three-pointer with 53.0 seconds left gave the Cavaliers the lead for good as Cleveland completed a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nNBA Finals lore also features dominant one-man performances.\n\nMagic Johnson famously filled in for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals, and the 20-year-old rookie totaled 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists to lead the Lakers to a title-clinching 123-107 victory.\n\nOn one historic occasion, the mere presence of a player provided the inspiration to win the championship. That uplifting scenario took place in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals with New York Knicks center Willis Reed.\n\nReed wasn't expected to play the series finale against the Lakers after suffering a muscle tear in his right thigh, but he shocked his teammates when he walked onto the court for pregame warmups. The Madison Square Garden crowd greeted him with a standing ovation.\n\nReed summoned the will and energy to play \"on one leg\" while trying to defend Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks captain played 27 minutes and finished with only four points, well below his 21.7-point average, but New York rallied behind Walt Frazier's 36 points and 19 assists to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\nLow TV ratings relegated the NBA Finals to be broadcast on tape delay in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, viewers who tuned in to Game 5 of the 1976 Finals were treated to an epic three-overtime battle between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe craziest sequence took place at the end of the second OT when John Havlicek banked in a 15-foot shot for what appeared to be the game-winner. One second was still on the clock, and it was more than enough time for Garfield Heard to sink a 20-foot turnaround jumper to force a third overtime.\n\nBoston eventually would win 128-126 to take a 3-2 series lead en route to the franchise's 13th NBA crown.\n\nEvolution of the NBA Finals Format\n\nIn 1985, the NBA changed its Finals format from 2-2-1-1-1âplaying consecutive games on each team's home court before alternating venues with single contestsâto a more travel-friendly 2-3-2 schedule.\n\nThe late David Stern admitted he made the change in his first year as NBA commissioner at the behest of  Celtics patriarch Auerbach, who saw the inconveniences of long cross-country travel during the 1984 Finals between the Celtics and Lakers.\n\n\"Although he's not here to defend himself and deny it, I tell you that Red said to me back in '84, 'This is too much. Play, travel, play, travel, play, travel,' \" Stern told reporters in 2008. \"In subsequent years he said it was terrible that we changed it to 2-3-2, but a young commissioner was motivated by the father of us all.\"\n\nHigher-seeded teams (due to a better regular-season record) still had the luxury of starting the series at home, but over the years, the 2-3-2 format favored the lower-seeded squad, which got to spend an entire week in its home city playing Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) on its court.\n\nIn 2013, the NBA approved a return to the 2-2-1-1 format. It has served as the Finals schedule since 2014 with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 2, 5 and 7 and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 3, 4 and 6.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\n\n\nÂ© 2025  ABG-SI LLC - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

He was an excellent on-ball defender, using his quickness and agility to stay in front of his opponents and disrupt their shots. He was also a great help defender, always aware of where his teammates were on the court and ready to step in and provie support when needed.\n\nIn addition to his DPOY award, Jordan was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, tied for the most in league history. He shares that honor with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant. Jordan’s defensive prowess was recognized by his peers and coaches alike, as evidenced by his numerous All-Defensive selections.\n\nJordan’s defensive efforts were not limited to the regular season, either. He was a key part of the Chicago Bulls’ championship teams in the 1990s, and his defense played a crucial role in those victories. In the NBA Finals, Jordan was named the Most Valuable Player six times, and his defensive efforts were a big reason why.\n\nMichael Jordan’s defensive abilities were a major part of his success as a basketball player. His quickness, agility, and awareness on the court made him a formidable opponent for any player he faced.

          "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nMichael Jordan also dominated the NBA on defense\n\nDespite having a size disadvantage, Michael Jordan repeatedly wins his defensive matchups in the paint against Charles Barkley. (0:29)\n\nIF THERE'S ONE thing that \"The Last Dance\" has demonstrated, it's that Michael Jordan was nearly impossible to guard. But nearly as impossible was trying to score when Jordan was guarding you.\n\n\"He's the best superstar defender in the history of the game,\" LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers says. As a player, Rivers often experienced the misfortune of trying to bring the ball up the floor with Jordan tracking him end line to end line.\n\nUsually, \"imposing his will\" referred to Jordan's gravity-defying dunks or artistic layups in traffic. But it also applies to the countless times he jumped passing lanes, blocked shots of 7-footers or merely saddled up so far into the grill of perimeter shooters that they could literally smell his sweat. Jordan is the only player since 1973-74 (when steals and blocks were first recorded) to submit 200 steals and 100 blocks in two different seasons. Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon are the only other players to reach that milestone once.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nDennis Rodman wants to set the record straight on Scottie Pippen5yJackie MacMullan\n\nThe Michael Jordan I knew is about to be revealed to the world5yJackie MacMullan\n\n\"In my mind, Michael was actually a defensive player who also happened to be an exceptionally talented offensive player,\" says B.J. Armstrong, his former Bulls teammate. \"In many ways, he knew the game on that side of the ball better. The way he moved, anticipated and invented ways to score based off what he saw on the defensive end ... he never cheated the process.\"\n\nJordan's defensive acumen was apparent in real time; he was selected first team All-Defense on nine occasions, tied with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant for most ever. And during the Bulls' three-year title run featuring Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Chicago led the league in defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Bulls were perpetually on a seek-and-destroy defensive mission, aiming not just to disrupt their opponents' offensive sets but to ultimately leave them in disarray.\n\nAnd no one relished that assignment more than Jordan.\n\n\"I've always thought players who talk trash defensively are far more devastating than the scorers who say stuff,\" Rivers says. \"Michael would say, 'I know what you want to do, you're not going right at all today.' And for me, that was tough, because I was always going right.\"\n\nJordan fastidiously studied the offensive sets of opponents and committed them to memory. He expected his teammates to do the same. Missing a shot was acceptable, but if you missed a defensive assignment, you would incur the wrath of His Airness.\n\n\"All anyone wants to talk about with the Bulls is the triangle. And that's fine, I have nothing against that,\" says Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who played against Jordan in the 1992 NBA Finals with the Portland Trail Blazers and again the following year with the Phoenix Suns. \"But it was the defense that made Chicago special. We could not score against them in the last five minutes of Game 6 [in 1993].\n\n\"Charles Barkley was the MVP of the league that year and Michael just loved the challenge of shutting him down. It was personal. He was going to make sure that no one could ever think they were in his category. Not Charles, not Clyde [Drexler], not anyone.\"\n\nMichael Jordan shows off his instincts as he helps on defense and rejects Patrick Ewing's shot out of bounds.\n\nJORDAN DIDN'T MAKE his first All-Defense team until the 1987-88 season, his fourth year in the league. He led the league in steals and was 14th in blocks -- the only guard in the top 40 that season.\n\n\"He got me a couple of times,\" says former New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing. \"The thing about him and Scottie was they were big enough, strong enough and athletic enough to challenge a guy like me. Michael could take that initial bump. Most guys couldn't or didn't want to absorb the contact. He didn't care.\"\n\nJordan habitually was knocked to the floor by the team he loathed most, the Detroit Pistons, who punctured his title dreams for three consecutive seasons with a physical, defensive-oriented style. But in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals, Jordan turned the tables on the Bad Boys.\n\nIn that series, Detroit averaged just 0.79 points per play with Jordan as the primary defender, and shot just 35%, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Jordan relentlessly tracked guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, pickpocketing them in the backcourt or springing out of his low defensive stance with catlike quickness to flood their passing lanes.\n\n\"Michael had very quick hands,\" Rivers says. \"And he was very smart in how he used them. The more athletic and dominant you are, the less people give you credit for your intelligence. It's funny, [Larry] Bird and Magic [Johnson], neither of them was a super athlete, so we gave them all this credit for their brains. Well, Michael was just as clever.\n\n\"That, combined with his athleticism, made him a suffocating defender. You're bringing the ball up thinking, 'Man, is this guy even going to let me get over half court?' It was unbearable.\"\n\nIn the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, Michael Jordan gets a series of steals and blocks en route to the Bulls' first-ever NBA Finals appearance.\n\nIn 1992, Ainge finished the season with Portland. Jordan was in town as a member of the Dream Team to play exhibition games in the Tournament of the Americas. The two hit the links for 36 holes the morning of Team USA's first game against Cuba. When they were finished, Ainge hustled to drop the league MVP at the hotel so Jordan could quickly shower and join the Olympic team on the bus.\n\n\"I get to the game,\" Ainge says, \"and I'm beat. The sun was really hot that day. I'm sitting there watching Michael, and he was just unbelievable. He was picking up guys full court on every possession for the entire 30 minutes he played. I couldn't believe how much energy he had.\n\n\"We played golf the next day, too, and I asked him, 'Why were you playing so hard in an exhibition game?' And he told me, 'I don't want anyone thinking they belong on the court with me.'\"\n\nIN HIS FINAL season with the Bulls, Jordan's ability to alter a game defensively was still on display at 35 years old. He finished fourth in Defensive Player of the Year voting behind Dikembe Mutombo,  Payton and David Robinson -- 10 years after his first and only DPOY award.\n\nAntoine Walker experienced his forcefulness on opening night of the 1997-98 season. The Celtics forward was en route to a 31-point night with Jason Caffey and Scott Burrell drawing the assignment for much of the game. An exasperated Jordan, who missed 16 of his 23 shots in that game, waved off his teammates and guarded Walker for the final minutes.\n\n\"He told me he was going to shut me down,\" Walker says, \"but it was too late. We won the game. We were celebrating in the hallway afterwards and Michael saw me. He said, 'You'll never beat us again.'\n\n\"And we didn't.\"\n\nAfter sweeping the New Jersey Nets in the opening round of the 1998 playoffs, the Bulls beat Charlotte in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Hornets coach Dave Cowens made an adjustment. Cowens knew the triangle provided Jordan and Pippen post-ups 6 to 7 feet from the basket, which both players favored, so he put bruising power forward Anthony Mason, his best post defender, on Jordan. This required Jordan to track Mason defensively in transition.\n\n\"Our rotations got so crazy that our guard, David Wesley, was guarding [7-foot center] Luc Longley under the basket -- and they still wouldn't throw him the ball,\" Cowens says now.\n\nThe other adjustment the Hornets made was to position sharpshooters Glen Rice and Dell Curry on the same side of the floor offensively, so Pippen and Jordan would skew to that side to guard them. That left the Hornets the other half of the floor to run pick-and-roll without interference from the Bulls' defensive stars. Charlotte stunned Chicago in Game 2, 78-76.\n\n\"Michael knew exactly what we were doing,\" says Armstrong, who was a reserve on that Hornets team. \"So when I checked in during Game 3, he immediately said, 'I'll take him.' Now, I wasn't one of our primary offensive threats, but Jordan understood we were trying to keep him away from the ball. What better way to keep track of the ball than guarding the guy with the ball?\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he made that adjustment himself. The guy's attention to detail was impeccable. People were wondering, 'Why is Jordan guarding the backup point guard on this team?' Because those are the little differences between winning and losing.\"\n\nThe Hornets didn't win another game in the series.\n\nThe Bulls advanced to play the Indiana Pacers in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals, triggering sour memories for point guard Mark Jackson, who previously had battled Chicago while he was a member of the Knicks. Jackson warned his Pacers teammates about Jordan's uncommon defensive resolve.\n\n\"You'd beat him with a move,\" Jackson says, \"and before you know it, he was right back there in front of you. His recovery skills were exceptional.\"\n\nESPN Daily podcast\n\nMonday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nThe Bulls put Pippen on Jackson to prevent him from posting up. Jordan matched up with, among others, Reggie Miller, an assignment he once complained was like \"chicken-fighting with a woman\" because of Miller's slender frame. Miller, a legendary trash-talker, objected, dishing barbs of his own.\n\n\"I think Reggie got under Michael's skin,\" Jackson says. \"Reggie had great respect for Michael, but he wasn't afraid. Michael's saying, 'I'm going to lock you up,' but we countered with, 'It's not just you and Reggie. It's you, Reggie and the 100 picks we're going to set for him.'\" Miller rejoiced when his famous \"push-off\" game-winning jumper over Jordan fell through in Game 4, but Jordan and the Bulls had the final say, holding Miller to just one shot in the fourth quarter of the series-deciding Game 7.\n\n\"Their defense,\" Pacers coach Larry Bird said in the immediate aftermath of the loss, \"is relentless.\"\n\nMichael Jordan doubles Karl Malone in the post and comes up with a steal before sinking an iconic game-winning shot to capture the 1998 NBA championship.\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN HYPERBOLE is at an all-time high as \"The Last Dance\" nears its conclusion, and one favorite mantra is that No. 23 never took a play off on either end. Ainge says that's not entirely accurate.\n\n\"When he was averaging 38 a game, and even later, when he 'slowed down' to 30 a game, Michael was still talented enough, savvy enough and prepared enough not to exert too much energy defensively,\" Ainge says. \"I liken it to a five-speed car. He could play in third gear and be better than most. And, when he shifted into that fifth gear, which he did at the end of games, he was Scottie-like.\"\n\nIn June 1998, as Jordan's career in Chicago dwindled to its final days, he challenged his teammates to close out their \"last dance\" by dominating the game on the defensive end. Chicago's opponent, the Utah Jazz, led the NBA in offensive efficiency during the regular season (110.9 points per 100 possession), but was held to just 94.3 in those 1998 Finals. If you combine the 1997 and 1998 Finals, the Jazz failed to score 90 points in 11 of the 12 games they played.\n\nJordan ended his career with the Bulls in poetic fashion: nailing the game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the Finals, his shooting motion frozen in time. It's an unforgettable image, but what people often fail to remember is how the Bulls first got possession.\n\nSeconds earlier, John Stockton had dumped the ball into Karl Malone in the post. Rodman was denying him on the left side when Jordan burst from behind on the right, swatting the ball free and taking off up the court to make history -- again.\n\nThat's right. Jordan's most iconic moment was the result of his defense.\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

So this group of Bulls stands as not only the best Bulls team of the Jordan era but the greatest team of all time.\n\nThey won 86.7 percent of all games they played, a ridiculous percentage that places them among the most dominant teams in any major U.S. pro sport. This was the fourth Bulls championship, earned in the first full season after Michael Jordan returned from his mid-90s “retirement.” They had winning streaks of 13 and 18 games and only once lost consecutive games, to the Nuggets and Suns on an early February trip West.\n\nThey won 14 of their first 15 games in the playoffs, and the loss to the Knicks came in overtime. Of the 15 postseason victories necessary to claim the NBA title, 10 came by double-digit margins.\n\n2. 1996-97\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nAlthough there is no question the 1996 team was superior, coming back a year later and nearly matching that performance might was, at its essence, even more impressive. Jordan and Pippen ranked among the top 20 in the league in minutes, even though each already had four championship rings. Toni Kukoc’s versatility off the bench continued to escalate. He ranked third on the team in shots and scoring and second in assists, behind Pippen. They opened the season with a 12-game winning streak, an amazing feat given this was a team that knew very well the championship was not going to be won in November.\n\n3. 1991-92\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the year of Jordan’s famous shrug, a gesture during Game 1 of the Finals series with the Blazers that underscored not only a moment, but an era. It was an acknowledgment that, indeed, even he could not believe he’d gotten so good. He earned 80 of a possible 96 first-place votes for MVP, 93.8 percent of a perfect score.\n\nCartwright missed 18 games because of injury but was back for a strong run in the playoffs, when he averaged 28 minutes, including a challenging matchup with Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing in which Ewing shot 8-of-19 from the field in the decisive game.\n\n4. 1990-91\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was not a strong year for the NBA overall, still absorbing the expansion by four teams in the previous three years. Detroit’s Bad Boys were showing wear and won only 50 games. The team with the best record in the league, the Trail Blazers, proved not ready for the spotlight and fell easily to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThe Bulls had to surmount mental hurdles to at last win a championship with Jordan on their side. Most notable among those was getting past the Pistons, but they also had to conquer a Lakers team accustomed to winning titles (but not used to doing it without Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). John Paxson’s 44 percent shooting from 3-poit range and Horace Grant’s growth into a 34-minute player were essential to the breakthrough.\n\n5. 1997-98\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThe injury that kept Pippen out at the beginning of “The Last Dance” season led to him starting only 44 games to Kukoc’s 52. By the time they Bulls were back to the playoffs, they were again using the rotation similar to what worked so beautifully the previous two years, albeit with Kukoc frequently filling Rodman’s spot as a starter.\n\nEven with Pippen missing for so long, the controversy regarding the declaration by Bulls management that Jackson would not return the following season and the distraction of Jordan constantly being asked about his future plans, the team still managed to tie the Jazz for best record in the league. It was another example of Jordan and the Bulls demonstrating that when it would be easy to relax – explicable, even – they still discovered the motivation to push through toward greatness.\n\nThere never was a \"Super Bowl hangover\" with Jordan's Bulls. Their Finals series against Utah was the most competitive of the six title teams; five of the six games were decided by two or fewer possessions. The title was won on a Jordan step-back jumper that has become among the most iconic shots in the game’s history.\n\n6. 1992-93\n\nThe stats\n\nWhat made them great\n\nThis was the only Bulls title team that didn’t reach the 60-win plateau, with the offense fading and more reliant on Jordan than at any point during the team’s championship run. Cartwright needed more help from Scott Williams to man the middle. They essentially split time at the center spot, and together they produced a double-figure rebound average.\n\nThere was a shaky moment in the conference finals against the blossoming Knicks, who rode the tough-guy front line Ewing, Anthony Mason and Charles Oakley to 60 victories and the No. 1 seed in the East. The Bulls lost the first two games of the series at Madison Square Garden, then blew out the Knicks in the next two games to remind them what they were facing in challenging this dynasty.\n\nThe closest the Bulls came to losing a championship arrived then, with each having won two games and the Bulls ahead by a point with 20 seconds remaining. Forward Charles Smith got the ball inside and had four attempts to make a game-winning layup, but all were challenged and/or blocked by Bulls defenders. That was it for the Knicks. No one ever came so close again to eliminating a full-strength Jordan/Bulls team.\n\nMike DeCourcy\n\nMike DeCourcy has been the college basketball columnist at The Sporting News since 1995.

He never even let it get to seven games - not even once, which is sick.\n\nWilt lost in the Finals numerous times, Russell lost in the 18=958 Finals, Bird lost in the Finals, Erving lost in the Finals, West lost in the Finals, Shaq lost in the Finals (2004) and Kobe lost in the Finals twice (2004 and 2008), Kareem lost in the Finals and Magic lost in the Finals, including against MJ himself.\n\nWhy is Jordan the greatest. His stats? Yep. 10 time scoring champion? Yep. Defensive Player of the Year? Yep. Five time NBA MVP? Yep. Perfection in the Finals with 6 MVP's? Yep and Yep.\n\nHere we see why no one can can in this guys rare air.\n\nMan you should'a seen this kids! Yo, this was straight sick. MJ went up against Magic and went out and busted through with four straight wins to take his first title.\n\nThe fabled Lakers couldn't hang with this one man. Don't even try the Pippen statement. Believe me, I was there dude. Pippen could do nothing on his own and he actually kinda sucked, except on defense. But Jordan was just dirty with it. He scored and passed better than Magic himself and averaged over 10 assists and 30 points. WTF?\n\nIn game one he scored 36 points had eight rebounds, 12 assists and three steals.\n\nIn game two he scored 33 points on 15/18 shooting, seven rebounds, 13 assists, two steals and a block.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 29 points and had nine rebounds and nine assists, four steals and two blocks.\n\nIn game four he scored 28 points, dished off for 13 assists and had five rebounds and two blocks.\n\nIn the closer MJ had 30 points, 10 assists and five steals.\n\nCan't hate on that. That is the GOAT right there.\n\n6'7\" Drexler was in his all-around prime and the Portlans team had way more options than Chicago who had uh....Michael Jordan.\n\nHe showed what was up in the first 24 minutes of the series. No one, even if they were bigger, heavier or stronger ever could or did stop him. Did they? Nope.\n\nIn game one he scored 39 points in 34 minutes and added 11 assists, but the six threes before halftime is the most exciting half in Finals history. 35 points at halftime is still a Finals record beeatches!\n\nIn game two MJ had 39 points and 10 assists.\n\nIn game three Jordan scored 26 and had seven rebounds, four assists and three steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 32 and added five rebounds and six assists.\n\nIn game five MJ went off on 14/23 from the field and 16/19 from the line and 2/3 from threes and schooled for 46 points.\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 33 points, had four steals, four rebounds and four assists and one block.\n\nTotally unstoppable man.\n\nAll MJ went out and did was record the highest scoring average in a Finals series ever with 41.0 ppg. Yep, let's see anyone in the league today be that dirty in the Finals. IMPOSSIBLE!\n\nJust put it this way: Game one 31 points, game two 42 points, game three 44 points, game four 55 points, game five 41 points and in the closer 33 points versus Barkley, Ainge, KJ, Chambers and Majerle.\n\nYes, that was FOUR STRAIGHT FINALS GAMES WITH OVER 40 POINTS. Get yourselves a reality check people. I saw every game MJ was obviously the best player in history and Pippen wasn't really that awesome in this series. Get it real: MJ is the only reason they won against a superior team.\n\nMan, this guy was greater at age 32-33 than any player ever. He had come out of retirement in 1995 and led the Bulls to a 13-4 record to finish the 1994-95 season but the Bulls didn't make it to the Finals. MJ was rusty really, after not playing for 18 months.\n\nSo he said to himself and his teammates - watch this!\n\nHe proceeded to lead his team to the greatest single season in NBA history with a 72-10 regular season record.\n\nIn game one of the Finals MJ scored 28 points and added seven rebounds.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 29 points and added six rebounds, eight assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three MJ scored 36 and had five assists and two steals.\n\nIn game four he scored 23 but the rest of the Bulls were actually on fire.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 26 points and added four rebounds.\n\nIn the closer MJ and the Bulls won so easily that MJ only needed to score 22, which is the least points he has ever scored in the Finals.\n\nPayton and Kemp could stop every one but not MJ.\n\nThe Bulls were led by 34 year old Michael to the second best record in NBA history with a 69-13 record. They have the top place too with 72-10. Over two season MJ led them to 141 wins and 23 loss record.\n\nMJ was there for every game and led the NBA in scoring both times, shooting 50%.\n\nIn game one of the Finals vs Stockton and Malone and Hornacek -  MJ scored 31 points and added eight assists.\n\nIn game two he scored 38 points with 13 rebounds and nine assists and two steals.\n\nIn game three he scored 26 points and had six assists.\n\nIn game four MJ scored a game high for either team with 22 points.\n\nIn game five MJ scored 38 points (he was sick that day too).\n\nIn the closer MJ scored 39 points and added 11 rebounds.\n\nMan, this dude was 34 and schooling these guys still. Jordan will not be topped we was that freaking great.\n\nAt age 35 MJ became the oldest MVP and scoring champion ever.\n\nHe also led the Bulls to a 62-20 record and took them to face Utah again.\n\nIn game one MJ had 33 points.\n\nIn game two MJ scored 37.\n\nIn game three he had 24 points in 32 minutes, because the Bulls were SO ahead.\n\nIn game four MJ scored 34 and added eight rebounds and two steals.\n\nIn game five Jordan scored 28 and had three steals.\n\nIn his last ever Finals game (cuz he retired again after this one) Jordan scored 45 points! One of his four steals led to him hitting the greatest and most famous and momentous last shot of a Finals series ever.\n\nThey way he held his hand in the air was so cool. No one left has such style.\n\nThere are over 100 reasons I can think of to explain how MJ is the greatest player who cannot be passed, especially by any player in the NBA today, but the whole point of this story is to show one thing.\n\nYes, there are player of great will and desire like Kobe, but Kobe lost in the Finals in 2004 and 2008. If Jordan was on the 2004 Lakers they would have won for damn sure. The 2004 Pistons would get stomped by the 1991 Pistons and the Lakers lost to them 4-1.\n\nKobe didn't do anything to make them win (and he had Malone, Shaq and Payton on his team so there's no excuse for losing), so he aint even in the conversation. In 2008 the Lakers lost even though they had Gasol. MJ never had a center worth much, but he never lost anyway.\n\nPut prime Jordan on the 2008 Lakers and they'd be champs for sure. You know how I know? MJ NEVER ONCE LOST IN THE FNALS BECAUSE HE WOULD NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN.\n\nThat is why Jordan is the greatest ever: they all lost and he didn't.\n\nLebron? Nope.\n\nWade? Nope.\n\nCarmelo? Nope.\n\nHoward? Nope.\n\nRose? Nope.\n\nDurant? Nope.\n\nKobe? Nope.\n\nMJ is the GOAT and you must accept it in order to be happy.\n\n"

Of those 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls for 13 (1984-93; 1995-98) and the Washington Wizards for a couple (2001-03).\n\nWhile he did record remarkable numbers for a player closer to 40 than 35, he was clearly in the twilight of his career with the WIzards. His greatest years came with the Bulls, predominantly in the 1990s when he led the franchise to six championships in as many Finals appearances over eight years.\n\n\n\nHere's a look at when Jordan won each of his six NBA titles, the numbers he put up in those seasons and the teams he beat en route to those championships:\n\n1991\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1991 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 31.5 points (1st in NBA), 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.7 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a conference-best 61-21 regular-season record (2nd in NBA). In the playoffs, Jordan averaged 31.1 points, 8.4 assists, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals as the Bulls dropped just two games en route to their first-ever title, with both losses only coming by two points.\n\nThe most iconic moment of this championship series came in Game 2 when Jordan pulled 'the spectacular move' by switching from a dunk to a left-handed layup mid-air:\n\n\n\n1992\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1992 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 30.1 points (1st in NBA), 6.4 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals, Jordan led the Bulls to a league-best 67-15 record. It was the first time in franchise history that the Bulls had recorded the league's best regular-season record.\n\nIn the playoffs, this time around, the Bulls faced a lot more competition. Dropping seven games in the 1992 postseason, Jordan led the Bulls with playoff averages of 34.5 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 2.0 steals. With this title, the Bulls, at that time, became only the third franchise after the Lakers and the Celtics to win back-to-back championships.\n\nMORE: How Jordan dominated Drexler in the 1992 Finals\n\nWhile there were plenty of other notable 'Jordan' moments in this postseason run, including a 54-point Game 4 performance against the Knicks, arguably the most memorable is the Shrug Game - Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n#OTD: The Shrug GameMichael Jordan sets #NBAFinals record for points (35) & threes (6) in a half in Game 1 of the 1992 #NBAFinals pic.twitter.com/C73Gs4T8hQ\n\n1993\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1993 NBA Championship:\n\nAveraging 32.6 points (1st in NBA), 6.7 rebounds, 5.5 assists, and 2.8 steals (1st in NBA), Jordan led the Bulls to a 57-25 record (3rd in NBA).\n\nIn the quest to become only the second franchise since the Celtics of the 1960s to win three straight titles, Jordan averaged a playoff career-high 35.1 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 2.1 steals.\n\nDuring the 1993 postseason, he recorded two 50-point games including a 55-point masterpiece in Game 4 of the Finals:\n\n\n\n1996\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1996 NBA Championship:\n\nPlaying his first full season since 1993, when he led the Bulls to a 3-peat, Jordan averaged 30.4 points (1st in NBA), 6.6 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.2 steals. He led the Bulls to a league-best 72-10, then an NBA record for most wins in a single season.\n\n\n\nIn the postseason, Jordan averaged 30.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.8 steals as the Bulls dropped just one game en route to the Finals. In the championship series, they quickly jumped to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and SuperSonics. While Sonics retaliated and won two straight, Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\n1997\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1997 NBA Championship:\n\nFor the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists as he played all 82 games. Coming off the NBA record 72 wins, the Bulls finished with a league-best 69-13 record.\n\nJust like the regular season, the Bulls breezed past the East in the playoffs and were set to face the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals. In the extremely competitive series, that saw an average winning margin of just six points, the defending champions came out on top.\n\n\n\nJordan averaged 31.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 4.8 assists, and 1.6 steals in the playoffs. More notably, in the Finals - Game 5 to be precise - he had one of the most iconic and memorable games of his career - 'The Flu Game'.\n\n\n\nBattling the Flu, Jordan finished with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and three steals in 44 minutes on the court.\n\n1998\n\n\n\nRoad to the 1998 NBA Championship:\n\nComing off 72 and 69 wins in the previous two years, the Bulls kept the momentum rolling. They tied the Utah Jazz for the league's best record of 62-20 as Jordan averaged 28.7 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists while playing all 82 games.\n\nThe Bulls cruised past the first two rounds but in the Conference Finals, just for the second time in the Bulls championship seasons, they were taken to a Game 7 by the Indiana Pacers. After narrowly beating them, they were set for a rematch with the Jazz but this contest ended in six games as well.\n\nMORE: The most underappreciated play of MJ's career\n\nJordan ended his Bulls career with one of the best sequences of his career - a steal on Malone followed by the game-winner over Byron Russell.\n\n\n\nThe views expressed here do not represent those of the NBA or its clubs.\n\nYash Matange\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\nPartners\n\n"

            "raw_content": "NBA Champions by Year: Complete History and Results of the NBA Finals\n\nJoe Lago | Apr 7, 2025\n\nBasketball's most cherished records are set in the regular season, but the playoffs is where lasting legacies are created.\n\nEach National Basketball Association season culminates in the NBA Finals, which determine the season's champion between the winners of the Western Conference and Eastern Conference. The best-of-seven game series finale also serves as the stage for players and teams to carve their places in hoops history.\n\nThe Origins of the NBA Finals\n\nThe NBA recognizes its first champion as the winner of the six-team Basketball Association of America, which began in 1947. The Philadelphia Warriors defeated the Chicago Staggs 4-1 and clinched the title behind Hall of Famer Joe Fulks, who scored 21 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5.\n\nThe Finals format of determining a champion in a first-to-four-victories series was modeled after Major League Baseball's World Series, which was the brainchild of John T. Brush. The New York Giants principal owner proposed a best-of-seven games contest between the American League and National League champs, and the \"Brush Rules\" were adopted in February 1905.\n\nThe BAA played its games in major venues, such as Madison Square Garden, Boston Garden and Chicago Stadium, but the best players competed in the National Basketball League. After the NBL's four best teams joined the BAA before the 1948-49 season, the competitors merged in 1949 to create a new pro basketball leagueâthe NBA.\n\nWhen the NBA expanded from 10 to 12 teams in 1968, the basketball market in America had room for a new upstart league in the American Basketball Association. The ABA promoted a flashy, high-scoring brand of hoops, including the three-point shot, but in 1976, the league folded with four of its teams joining the NBA â Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nEvery NBA Champion in History\n\nGeorge Mikan and the Minneapolis Lakers won the first NBA Finals in 1950, defeating the Syracuse Nationals 4-2. The Lakers featured Hall of Famers in Mikan, Jim Pollard, Slater Martin and Vern Mikkelsen, and with the 6'10\" Mikan, they dominated defensively on their narrow home court at Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nMinneapolis would win three more NBA Finals before the league's defining dynasty took over.\n\nIn 1957, the Boston Celtics defeated the St. Louis Hawks 4-3 to capture their first-ever NBA championship. Under legendary coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won 10 more league crowns over the next 12 seasons. Bill Russell served as the inspirational leader and defensive anchor for all 11 title teams and is the record holder for most NBA championships by a player.\n\nThe Celtics enjoyed another run of success in the 1980s, but it coincided with the emergence of a new Lakers dynasty in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Larry Bird vs. Magic Johnson rivalry that elevated college basketball to new heights had the same game-changing impact on the NBA. The two all-time greats faced off in some of the league's most memorable Finals battles and combined for eight championships in the 80sâJohnson outdueling Bird 5-3 in Larry O'Brien Trophy wins.\n\nMore dynasties would rule the NBA.\n\nIn the 1990s, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls achieved not one but two three-peats by winning three consecutive titles from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998. Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors ushered in a new era of prioritizing the three-pointer when they won the 2015 crown, the first of four championships in an eight-year period.\n\nThe Celtics have won the most NBA titles with 18, one more than the Lakers. The Warriors rank third with seven championships. The Bulls and Spurs have won six and five NBA crowns, respectively.\n\nYear | Winning Team | Losing Team | Series Result | Finals MVP\n1947 | Philadelphia Warriors | Chicago Stags | 4-1 | \n1948 |

in NBA Finals History\n\nThe NBA's all-time greats each have produced an iconic Finals moment that lives on in the memories of basketball fans and in perpetuity on YouTube. The most celebrated plays are the clutch shots that helped their teams secure the championship.\n\nArguably the most iconic shot in NBA history is Michael Jordan's 20-foot jumper that clinched the Bulls' 1998 title against the Utah Jazz. Expected to retire after the series, the 34-year-old Jordan scored on a layup to cut Chicago's deficit to one point, stole the ball from Karl Malone and then crossed over Bryon Russell to bury the go-ahead basket with 5.2 seconds left.\n\nJordan walked away from basketball (temporarily) after winning his sixth NBA championship.\n\nLeBron James, who shares the \"Greatest of All Time\" status with Jordan, has his own Finals highlight with the most historic display of championship-level defense for his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIn Game 7 of perhaps the greatest NBA Finals ever against the record-setting 73-win Warriors in 2016, James chased down Andre Iguodala to block his layup attempt and keep the score tied at 89 with less than two minutes remaining. Kyrie Irving's three-pointer with 53.0 seconds left gave the Cavaliers the lead for good as Cleveland completed a historic comeback from a 3-1 series deficit.\n\nNBA Finals lore also features dominant one-man performances.\n\nMagic Johnson famously filled in for an injured Kareem Abdul-Jabbar at center in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals, and the 20-year-old rookie totaled 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists to lead the Lakers to a title-clinching 123-107 victory.\n\nOn one historic occasion, the mere presence of a player provided the inspiration to win the championship. That uplifting scenario took place in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals with New York Knicks center Willis Reed.\n\nReed wasn't expected to play the series finale against the Lakers after suffering a muscle tear in his right thigh, but he shocked his teammates when he walked onto the court for pregame warmups. The Madison Square Garden crowd greeted him with a standing ovation.\n\nReed summoned the will and energy to play \"on one leg\" while trying to defend Wilt Chamberlain. The Knicks captain played 27 minutes and finished with only four points, well below his 21.7-point average, but New York rallied behind Walt Frazier's 36 points and 19 assists to win the franchise's first NBA championship.\n\nLow TV ratings relegated the NBA Finals to be broadcast on tape delay in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, viewers who tuned in to Game 5 of the 1976 Finals were treated to an epic three-overtime battle between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics.\n\nThe craziest sequence took place at the end of the second OT when John Havlicek banked in a 15-foot shot for what appeared to be the game-winner. One second was still on the clock, and it was more than enough time for Garfield Heard to sink a 20-foot turnaround jumper to force a third overtime.\n\nBoston eventually would win 128-126 to take a 3-2 series lead en route to the franchise's 13th NBA crown.\n\nEvolution of the NBA Finals Format\n\nIn 1985, the NBA changed its Finals format from 2-2-1-1-1âplaying consecutive games on each team's home court before alternating venues with single contestsâto a more travel-friendly 2-3-2 schedule.\n\nThe late David Stern admitted he made the change in his first year as NBA commissioner at the behest of  Celtics patriarch Auerbach, who saw the inconveniences of long cross-country travel during the 1984 Finals between the Celtics and Lakers.\n\n\"Although he's not here to defend himself and deny it, I tell you that Red said to me back in '84, 'This is too much. Play, travel, play, travel, play, travel,' \" Stern told reporters in 2008. \"In subsequent years he said it was terrible that we changed it to 2-3-2, but a young commissioner was motivated by the father of us all.\"\n\nHigher-seeded teams (due to a better regular-season record) still had the luxury of starting the series at home, but over the years, the 2-3-2 format favored the lower-seeded squad, which got to spend an entire week in its home city playing Games 3, 4 and 5 (if necessary) on its court.\n\nIn 2013, the NBA approved a return to the 2-2-1-1 format. It has served as the Finals schedule since 2014 with the higher-seeded team hosting Games 1, 2, 5 and 7 and the lower-seeded team hosting Games 3, 4 and 6.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\n\n\nÂ© 2025  ABG-SI LLC - SPORTS ILLUSTRATED IS A REGISTERED TRADEMARK OF ABG-SI LLC. - All Rights Reserved.

He was an excellent on-ball defender, using his quickness and agility to stay in front of his opponents and disrupt their shots. He was also a great help defender, always aware of where his teammates were on the court and ready to step in and provie support when needed.\n\nIn addition to his DPOY award, Jordan was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team nine times, tied for the most in league history. He shares that honor with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant. Jordan’s defensive prowess was recognized by his peers and coaches alike, as evidenced by his numerous All-Defensive selections.\n\nJordan’s defensive efforts were not limited to the regular season, either. He was a key part of the Chicago Bulls’ championship teams in the 1990s, and his defense played a crucial role in those victories. In the NBA Finals, Jordan was named the Most Valuable Player six times, and his defensive efforts were a big reason why.\n\nMichael Jordan’s defensive abilities were a major part of his success as a basketball player. His quickness, agility, and awareness on the court made him a formidable opponent for any player he faced.

            "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nMichael Jordan also dominated the NBA on defense\n\nDespite having a size disadvantage, Michael Jordan repeatedly wins his defensive matchups in the paint against Charles Barkley. (0:29)\n\nIF THERE'S ONE thing that \"The Last Dance\" has demonstrated, it's that Michael Jordan was nearly impossible to guard. But nearly as impossible was trying to score when Jordan was guarding you.\n\n\"He's the best superstar defender in the history of the game,\" LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers says. As a player, Rivers often experienced the misfortune of trying to bring the ball up the floor with Jordan tracking him end line to end line.\n\nUsually, \"imposing his will\" referred to Jordan's gravity-defying dunks or artistic layups in traffic. But it also applies to the countless times he jumped passing lanes, blocked shots of 7-footers or merely saddled up so far into the grill of perimeter shooters that they could literally smell his sweat. Jordan is the only player since 1973-74 (when steals and blocks were first recorded) to submit 200 steals and 100 blocks in two different seasons. Scottie Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon are the only other players to reach that milestone once.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nDennis Rodman wants to set the record straight on Scottie Pippen5yJackie MacMullan\n\nThe Michael Jordan I knew is about to be revealed to the world5yJackie MacMullan\n\n\"In my mind, Michael was actually a defensive player who also happened to be an exceptionally talented offensive player,\" says B.J. Armstrong, his former Bulls teammate. \"In many ways, he knew the game on that side of the ball better. The way he moved, anticipated and invented ways to score based off what he saw on the defensive end ... he never cheated the process.\"\n\nJordan's defensive acumen was apparent in real time; he was selected first team All-Defense on nine occasions, tied with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant for most ever. And during the Bulls' three-year title run featuring Jordan, Pippen and Dennis Rodman, Chicago led the league in defensive efficiency, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The Bulls were perpetually on a seek-and-destroy defensive mission, aiming not just to disrupt their opponents' offensive sets but to ultimately leave them in disarray.\n\nAnd no one relished that assignment more than Jordan.\n\n\"I've always thought players who talk trash defensively are far more devastating than the scorers who say stuff,\" Rivers says. \"Michael would say, 'I know what you want to do, you're not going right at all today.' And for me, that was tough, because I was always going right.\"\n\nJordan fastidiously studied the offensive sets of opponents and committed them to memory. He expected his teammates to do the same. Missing a shot was acceptable, but if you missed a defensive assignment, you would incur the wrath of His Airness.\n\n\"All anyone wants to talk about with the Bulls is the triangle. And that's fine, I have nothing against that,\" says Boston Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge, who played against Jordan in the 1992 NBA Finals with the Portland Trail Blazers and again the following year with the Phoenix Suns. \"But it was the defense that made Chicago special. We could not score against them in the last five minutes of Game 6 [in 1993].\n\n\"Charles Barkley was the MVP of the league that year and Michael just loved the challenge of shutting him down. It was personal. He was going to make sure that no one could ever think they were in his category. Not Charles, not Clyde [Drexler], not anyone.\"\n\nMichael Jordan shows off his instincts as he helps on defense and rejects Patrick Ewing's shot out of bounds.\n\nJORDAN DIDN'T MAKE his first All-Defense team until the 1987-88 season, his fourth year in the league. He led the league in steals and was 14th in blocks -- the only guard in the top 40 that season.\n\n\"He got me a couple of times,\" says former New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing. \"The thing about him and Scottie was they were big enough, strong enough and athletic enough to challenge a guy like me. Michael could take that initial bump. Most guys couldn't or didn't want to absorb the contact. He didn't care.\"\n\nJordan habitually was knocked to the floor by the team he loathed most, the Detroit Pistons, who punctured his title dreams for three consecutive seasons with a physical, defensive-oriented style. But in the 1991 Eastern Conference finals, Jordan turned the tables on the Bad Boys.\n\nIn that series, Detroit averaged just 0.79 points per play with Jordan as the primary defender, and shot just 35%, according to research by ESPN Stats & Information. Jordan relentlessly tracked guards Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars, pickpocketing them in the backcourt or springing out of his low defensive stance with catlike quickness to flood their passing lanes.\n\n\"Michael had very quick hands,\" Rivers says. \"And he was very smart in how he used them. The more athletic and dominant you are, the less people give you credit for your intelligence. It's funny, [Larry] Bird and Magic [Johnson], neither of them was a super athlete, so we gave them all this credit for their brains. Well, Michael was just as clever.\n\n\"That, combined with his athleticism, made him a suffocating defender. You're bringing the ball up thinking, 'Man, is this guy even going to let me get over half court?' It was unbearable.\"\n\nIn the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, Michael Jordan gets a series of steals and blocks en route to the Bulls' first-ever NBA Finals appearance.\n\nIn 1992, Ainge finished the season with Portland. Jordan was in town as a member of the Dream Team to play exhibition games in the Tournament of the Americas. The two hit the links for 36 holes the morning of Team USA's first game against Cuba. When they were finished, Ainge hustled to drop the league MVP at the hotel so Jordan could quickly shower and join the Olympic team on the bus.\n\n\"I get to the game,\" Ainge says, \"and I'm beat. The sun was really hot that day. I'm sitting there watching Michael, and he was just unbelievable. He was picking up guys full court on every possession for the entire 30 minutes he played. I couldn't believe how much energy he had.\n\n\"We played golf the next day, too, and I asked him, 'Why were you playing so hard in an exhibition game?' And he told me, 'I don't want anyone thinking they belong on the court with me.'\"\n\nIN HIS FINAL season with the Bulls, Jordan's ability to alter a game defensively was still on display at 35 years old. He finished fourth in Defensive Player of the Year voting behind Dikembe Mutombo,  Payton and David Robinson -- 10 years after his first and only DPOY award.\n\nAntoine Walker experienced his forcefulness on opening night of the 1997-98 season. The Celtics forward was en route to a 31-point night with Jason Caffey and Scott Burrell drawing the assignment for much of the game. An exasperated Jordan, who missed 16 of his 23 shots in that game, waved off his teammates and guarded Walker for the final minutes.\n\n\"He told me he was going to shut me down,\" Walker says, \"but it was too late. We won the game. We were celebrating in the hallway afterwards and Michael saw me. He said, 'You'll never beat us again.'\n\n\"And we didn't.\"\n\nAfter sweeping the New Jersey Nets in the opening round of the 1998 playoffs, the Bulls beat Charlotte in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Hornets coach Dave Cowens made an adjustment. Cowens knew the triangle provided Jordan and Pippen post-ups 6 to 7 feet from the basket, which both players favored, so he put bruising power forward Anthony Mason, his best post defender, on Jordan. This required Jordan to track Mason defensively in transition.\n\n\"Our rotations got so crazy that our guard, David Wesley, was guarding [7-foot center] Luc Longley under the basket -- and they still wouldn't throw him the ball,\" Cowens says now.\n\nThe other adjustment the Hornets made was to position sharpshooters Glen Rice and Dell Curry on the same side of the floor offensively, so Pippen and Jordan would skew to that side to guard them. That left the Hornets the other half of the floor to run pick-and-roll without interference from the Bulls' defensive stars. Charlotte stunned Chicago in Game 2, 78-76.\n\n\"Michael knew exactly what we were doing,\" says Armstrong, who was a reserve on that Hornets team. \"So when I checked in during Game 3, he immediately said, 'I'll take him.' Now, I wasn't one of our primary offensive threats, but Jordan understood we were trying to keep him away from the ball. What better way to keep track of the ball than guarding the guy with the ball?\n\n\"I'm pretty sure he made that adjustment himself. The guy's attention to detail was impeccable. People were wondering, 'Why is Jordan guarding the backup point guard on this team?' Because those are the little differences between winning and losing.\"\n\nThe Hornets didn't win another game in the series.\n\nThe Bulls advanced to play the Indiana Pacers in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals, triggering sour memories for point guard Mark Jackson, who previously had battled Chicago while he was a member of the Knicks. Jackson warned his Pacers teammates about Jordan's uncommon defensive resolve.\n\n\"You'd beat him with a move,\" Jackson says, \"and before you know it, he was right back there in front of you. His recovery skills were exceptional.\"\n\nESPN Daily podcast\n\nMonday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nThe Bulls put Pippen on Jackson to prevent him from posting up. Jordan matched up with, among others, Reggie Miller, an assignment he once complained was like \"chicken-fighting with a woman\" because of Miller's slender frame. Miller, a legendary trash-talker, objected, dishing barbs of his own.\n\n\"I think Reggie got under Michael's skin,\" Jackson says. \"Reggie had great respect for Michael, but he wasn't afraid. Michael's saying, 'I'm going to lock you up,' but we countered with, 'It's not just you and Reggie. It's you, Reggie and the 100 picks we're going to set for him.'\" Miller rejoiced when his famous \"push-off\" game-winning jumper over Jordan fell through in Game 4, but Jordan and the Bulls had the final say, holding Miller to just one shot in the fourth quarter of the series-deciding Game 7.\n\n\"Their defense,\" Pacers coach Larry Bird said in the immediate aftermath of the loss, \"is relentless.\"\n\nMichael Jordan doubles Karl Malone in the post and comes up with a steal before sinking an iconic game-winning shot to capture the 1998 NBA championship.\n\nMICHAEL JORDAN HYPERBOLE is at an all-time high as \"The Last Dance\" nears its conclusion, and one favorite mantra is that No. 23 never took a play off on either end. Ainge says that's not entirely accurate.\n\n\"When he was averaging 38 a game, and even later, when he 'slowed down' to 30 a game, Michael was still talented enough, savvy enough and prepared enough not to exert too much energy defensively,\" Ainge says. \"I liken it to a five-speed car. He could play in third gear and be better than most. And, when he shifted into that fifth gear, which he did at the end of games, he was Scottie-like.\"\n\nIn June 1998, as Jordan's career in Chicago dwindled to its final days, he challenged his teammates to close out their \"last dance\" by dominating the game on the defensive end. Chicago's opponent, the Utah Jazz, led the NBA in offensive efficiency during the regular season (110.9 points per 100 possession), but was held to just 94.3 in those 1998 Finals. If you combine the 1997 and 1998 Finals, the Jazz failed to score 90 points in 11 of the 12 games they played.\n\nJordan ended his career with the Bulls in poetic fashion: nailing the game-winning jumper over Bryon Russell in Game 6 of the Finals, his shooting motion frozen in time. It's an unforgettable image, but what people often fail to remember is how the Bulls first got possession.\n\nSeconds earlier, John Stockton had dumped the ball into Karl Malone in the post. Rodman was denying him on the left side when Jordan burst from behind on the right, swatting the ball free and taking off up the court to make history -- again.\n\nThat's right. Jordan's most iconic moment was the result of his defense.\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.
