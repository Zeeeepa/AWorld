        "raw_content": "LeBron James Finals Record: Reviewing LeBron James's six NBA Finals losses\n\nLeBron James is inarguably one of the best in basketball history, for some people he is the greatest of all time, but his finals record might be the Achilles heel of his legacy.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the seventh player in NBA history that reached nine finals in a career, and the fifth ever to do so eight straight seasons.\n\nGolden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-85 to sweep the series and give LeBron his sixth NBA Finals loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was also the fourth final loss for \"The King\" in five years. In nine NBA Finals James' teams have been favorites only twice, both with the Miami Heat, winning one of two.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nHowever, LeBron still has three NBA trophies and three NBA Finals MVP awards to his name and his 15th season proved he is still in his prime.\n\nAlso check out: Lebron James’ Finals Appearances and stats\n\nHere's a look at the six NBA Finals losses of LeBron James:\n\n2007 - The First Sweep: against San Antonio Spurs (0-4)\n\nJames' first trip to an NBA Finals was one to forget.\n\nLeBron led the Cavs to their first finals in franchise history just to be swept by the Spurs.\n\nCleveland was considered underdog to a San Antonio team that won its fourth NBA title with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker all in their prime.\n\nThe then 22-year-old James and Cleveland went through a hard Eastern Conference playoff, where they defeated Washington Wizards, the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons on their way to the finals.\n\nSan Antonio defeated the Cavs in the first two games easily. James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!
