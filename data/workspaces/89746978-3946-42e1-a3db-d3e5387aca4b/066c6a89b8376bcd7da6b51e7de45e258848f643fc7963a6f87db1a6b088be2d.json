The rivalry began in the late 1980s and was one of the most intense in NBA history for several years, when Michael Jordan evolved into one of the league's best players and the Pistons became a playoff contender.  They represent the two largest metro areas in the Midwest and are only separated by a 280-mile (450 km) stretch of road, mostly covered by I-94, which is a factor in the two cities’ rivalries with each other in other sports besides basketball.\n\nChicago BullsDetroit Pistons\nFirst meeting | October 28, 1966Pistons 129, Bulls 117[1]\nLatest meeting | February 12, 2025Pistons 128, Bulls 110\nNext meeting | TBA\nStatistics\nMeetings total | 320\nAll-time series | 163–157 (CHI)\nRegular season series | 147–138 (CHI)\nPostseason results | 19–16 (DET)\nLongest win streak | CHI W19\nCurrent win streak | DET W3\nPostseason history\n1974 Western Conference Semifinals: Bulls won, 4–31988 Eastern Conference Semifinals: Pistons won, 4–11989 Eastern Conference Finals: Pistons won, 4–21990 Eastern Conference Finals: Pistons won, 4–31991 Eastern Conference Finals: Bulls won, 4–02007 Eastern Conference Semifinals: Pistons won, 4–2\nContents\n\nHistory\n\n1988–90: The Bad Boys and Jordan Rules\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs for the first time in the 1974 Western Conference Semifinals which the Bulls won in seven games. But the rivalry really started in the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals after the Pistons and Bulls beat the Bullets and Cavs in the first round 3–2. The aggressive Bad Boys, as Detroit became known, were the rising power in the Eastern Conference. Michael Jordan, on the other hand, was league MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and the ultimate challenge for the Pistons' top-notch defense. In a nationally televised game in Detroit on Easter Sunday, Jordan scored 59 points in a 112–110 Bulls victory. Previously, in 1987, he had scored 61 points in a 125–120 OT victory. This angered Chuck Daly, who vowed never to allow Jordan to light them up again. Despite Jordan's individual skills, the Bulls lacked the talent and mental toughness to beat Detroit, who defeated Chicago in 5 games. The Pistons went on to beat Boston in 6 and won their first Conference title since they moved from Fort Wayne.\nIn 1989, the Pistons were stronger and posted a season-best record of 63–19. They reached the Conference Finals by sweeping the Celtics and Bucks. The 6th-seeded Bulls (47–35) had surprising success in the playoffs by upsetting the Cavs 3–2 with The Shot and Knicks 4–2. The Bulls met Detroit in the Eastern Conference Finals. Bulls success continued as they took a 2–1 series lead. But the Pistons clamped down and employed the \"Jordan Rules\" (which consisted of solely targeting Jordan) which worked so well for them the year prior. While they remained silent about them when asked by the media, many Pistons today say that it was just another psychological ploy they made up to throw the Bulls off their game. According to Pistons forward Rick Mahorn,\n\nWe were just throwing stuff out there. It was just a joke. Chuck throws it out there that we had some secret plan to stop Jordan, and everybody just jumped on it. Everybody was writing stories about this strategy. When we kept reading about it, Isiah told us that we had gotten in their heads, and that's how we had them beat.[2]\n\nThe Pistons won 3 straight games and went on to win their first NBA title.\n\nWhile both teams intensely disliked each other, there was particular animosity between Michael Jordan and Pistons star Isiah Thomas. Thomas, who was a Chicago native and basketball legend in the city, is accused of feeling that Jordan was taking the city away from him and getting unearned attention.[3] Thomas was accused of leading a so-called \"freeze-out\" in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game that involved Thomas and other NBA veterans keeping the ball away from Jordan. In retaliation, when the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team was being formed Isiah was not part of the team, which people attribute to Jordan and Scottie Pippen stating that they did not want to play if Thomas was on the team, with Pippen going as far to label him as a \"cheap shot artist\".[4]\n\nFor the 1989–90 season under new coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls sought to subvert the \"Jordan Rules\" by focusing on the triangle offense refined by assistant coach Tex Winter. By sharing responsibility rather than shouldering it, Jordan led Chicago to the second-best record in the East at 55–27 behind the defending champion Pistons, who finished 59–23. The rematch was set up when Detroit swept Indiana in the opening round, then ousted New York in 5. The Bulls beat the Bucks in 4 and 76ers in 5. In an Eastern Conference Finals rematch, Chicago pushed Detroit to the limit. But the Pistons showed their dominance and won Game 7 at home. The Pistons went on to win their 2nd straight NBA title against the Blazers.\n\n1991: The Bulls finally break through\n\nFor the 1990–91 season, Bulls posted the best record in the East at 61–21, while the Pistons would drop to third with a record of 50–32. The Bulls reached the Conference Finals by sweeping the Knicks and beating the 76ers in 5, while the Pistons disposed of Atlanta in 5 and beat Boston in 6. Both teams met in the Conference Finals for the third straight year, with Chicago holding home-court advantage for the first time. Chicago swept Detroit. Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer and Mark Aguirre, in their last show of defiance, walked off the court with 7.9 seconds left so as not to congratulate them. Only Joe Dumars and John Salley shook hands with any of the Bulls.[5][6] In the NBA Finals, the Bulls defeated Magic Johnson's Lakers to win their 1st NBA title.[7][8][9]\n\nDormancy\n\nThe Pistons and Bulls would never again meet in the playoffs during the Bulls dynasty, although they came close in both 1992 and 1997. Following the 1991 sweep, James Edwards and Vinnie Johnson would leave the Pistons as free agents, and the team would see a steady decline. Chuck Daly would resign as head coach after the 1991–92 season. Following Daly's departure, the Pistons went through a lengthy transitional period, as key players either retired (Laimbeer in 1993 and Thomas in 1994) or got traded (John Salley, Dennis Rodman among others). They would bottom out in the 1993–94 season, finishing only 20–62.\n\nWith the arrival of Grant Hill (drafted 3rd overall in 1994), the Pistons once again became a playoff team in the latter half of the 1990s. Despite seeing some success during that period, they never became true title contenders.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bulls proceeded to win 6 titles in 8 years, including two three-peats, with an early retirement and return of Michael Jordan in between. Former Piston Dennis Rodman, would be traded to the Bulls in 1995 and play an integral part in the second three-peat and during that second three-peat Dennis Rodman would not interact with Jordan or Pippen outside of games[4](John Salley and James Edwards were also on the team during the record-breaking 72-win 1995–96 season). After the 6th title, the Bulls were dramatically dismantled: Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Rodman, and coach Phil Jackson all left. Afterwards, the Bulls had five losing seasons and did not yield a competitive squad until former Bull John Paxson (who was a member of the first 3 title teams) became the GM and acquired players to form a team with efficient perimeter offense and strong interior defense.\n\nAfter being swept by the Miami Heat in the 2000 playoffs, Joe Dumars was hired as President of Basketball Operations of Pistons. Dumars eventually revamped the Pistons' roster with players like Ben Wallace, Chucky Atkins, Chauncey Billups, Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton,  Tayshaun Prince.[10][11][12] and Rasheed Wallace.[13] They were constant playoff contenders with Six consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearances between 2003 and 2008. They defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for the team's third NBA championship in 2004 NBA Finals.[14][15]\n\nThe rivalry returns\n\nThe rivalry was restored in the 2006 offseason when the Bulls signed free agent Ben Wallace, the cornerstone of the Pistons' defense. The addition of Wallace was immediately felt when the Bulls won the first regular season game in a blowout against the defending champion Miami Heat, the team that defeated the Pistons in the 2006 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nThe move of Ben Wallace stymied the Pistons early in the season, as the team sought to look for consistency without him. Dumars took the initiative and signed Chris Webber, who was just released from the 76ers. The teams met in the Eastern Conference Semifinals after the Pistons swept the Magic and the Bulls swept the Heat. The Pistons dominated the early parts of the series, stifling the Bulls' guards to sub-40% shooting to win not only the first two games at home, but also the first game in Chicago, in which the Pistons came back from a 17-point deficit in the second half. The Bulls shut down the Pistons' offense in the next two games to win Games 4 and 5. However, the Pistons won Game 6 in Chicago, winning the series 4–2.\n\nAnother dormant period\n\nThe Pistons made it back to the Conference Finals in 2008. Chauncey Billups was traded early in the 2009 season, and they steadily declined. The Cleveland Cavaliers swept them in 2009. The Pistons signed free-agents Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva, and welcomed back Ben Wallace that offseason. However, injuries demoted them from an Eastern Conference power, winning only 27 games in the 2010 season, thus a rebuilding period for the team began. The team did manage to make it to the playoffs once again in 2016, once again losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in a four-game sweep.\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in a dismal 2008, the Bulls earned the first pick in the 2008 NBA draft. They selected Chicago native Derrick Rose. The Bulls steadily rose to one of the NBA's elite teams; after a pair of 41-win seasons in Rose's first two seasons, the Bulls signed free-agent forward Carlos Boozer, and with the development of Joakim Noah to one of the best centers in the league, the Bulls rose the ranks in the Eastern Conference. However, subsequent injuries to Rose demoted them from being an elite team, and the team would struggle with inconsistency for several years. After trading Rose in 2016 and star forward Jimmy Butler in 2017, another rebuilding period began for the Bulls. Later on, Jordan would reflect on the Bulls–Pistons rivalry and he still does not like the Bad Boys Pistons team.[5]\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Bulls and Pistons played the NBA Paris Game at Accor Arena in Paris, France during the regular season.[16] The Bulls, led by Zach LaVine, won the game 126–108.[17]\n\nSeason-by-season results\n\nChicago Bulls vs. Detroit Pistons Season-by-Season

Michael Jordan had many iconic games against the \"Bad Boys\" throughout his career, and perhaps the most impressive one was when he dropped 59 points on their home floor on Easter Sunday in 1988. Jordan's performance that night was miraculous, and it soon gave birth to Detroit's ultra-specific rules targeting His Airness called the \"Jordan Rules.\"\n\nIn a zone\n\nOn that April afternoon, Jordan was simply unstoppable as he connected on all but six of his 27 attempts from the field and made 17 of his 19 free-throws. He also filled the stat sheet up with six assists, four rebounds, two steals, and two blocks in what was Jordan's second-highest scoring performance against Detroit. Most importantly, Chicago came away with a 112-110 victory.\n\nThe Jordan Rules\n\nConsidering that Jordan also dropped 61 points on them a year before that game, Detroit head coach Chuck Daly was frustrated and simply had enough of Jordan beating the Pistons by himself.\n\n\"We made up our minds right then and there that Michael Jordan was not going to beat us by himself again,\" said Daly. \"We had to commit to a total team concept to get it done.\"\n\nAnd so the \"Jordan Rules\" were created. From that point on, when Jordan had the ball in his hands, he was literally double-teamed and even triple-teamed to prevent him from scoring. The Pistons were so committed to this strategy that it eventually became known as \"The Jordan Rules.\"\n\nThis hard-hitting tactic slowed down Jordan for many years, as he was unable to get past the Pistons in the playoffs until 1991. As Jordan's Bulls began to mature, they became a well-oiled machine and eventually figured out how to break \"The Jordan Rules.\" The Bulls finally conquered the Pistons in 1991 and went on to win their first championship that same year.\n\nStephen Beslic is a writer on Sports Illustrated's FanNation Network.

Were the âBad Boysâ his biggest challenge?\n\nOn Sunday, April 19, ESPN films will debut the first two installments of its highly anticipated miniseries entitled âThe Last Danceâ.Â  The ten episode documentary will focus on the 1997-1998 Chicago Bulls and is said to feature never before seen footage and stories of Michael Jordan.\n\nJordan and the Bulls faced off against a wide range of legendary opponents during their run including the Utah Jazz, Los Angeles Lakers, and Seattle Supersonics. However, these teams were no match as Jordanâs Bulls won 6 championships.\n\nBut before winning his 6 championships, Jordan had to win his 1st. And in the years leading up to his 1st championship, Jordan faced what would end up being the biggest challenge of his career: the Detroit Pistons and their âJordan Rulesâ.\n\nThe Pistons and Bulls faced off in 4 straight postseasons beginning in 1988. That season, a 24-year old Michael Jordan was ready to take over the league after winning the MVP and beating the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. The Pistons had something else to say, beating the Bulls in 5 games and sending Jordan home for the summer.\n\nJordan came back in 1989 with something to prove. The Bulls and Pistons would once again meet in the playoffs, this time in the Eastern Conference Finals. Chicago got off to a hot start, going up 2-1 in the series, with Jordan pouring in 46 points in game 3.\n\nThe Pistons needed a plan to slow down Jordan. According to interviews featured in ESPNâs 30-for-30 entitled Bad Boys, Isiah Thomas was sitting by Lake Michigan in Chicago and called teammate Joe Dumars to say, âIâve got it. I know how we can stop Jordanâ\n\nThe âJordan Rulesâ were as follows: If Michael is at the point, force him left and double him. If he is on the left wing, immediately double him. If he is on the right wing, force him middle and double him.\n\nThe only other rule: Anytime Michael goes by you â nail him. Put him on the ground on every drive.\n\nBacked by their newfound defensive strategy, Detroit went on to win three straight games, advancing to the NBA Finals (eventually winning the title). Once again, Jordanâs season had ended at the hands of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nFueled by the bad taste of defeat, Jordan came to play when the two teams met again in the 1990 Eastern Conference Finals. His series averages were insane â 32.1 points per game, 7.1 rebounds per game, and 6.3 assists.\n\nBut for the third time in a row, the Pistons won the series â this time in 7 games. Again, the Bad Boys would go on to win another championship.\n\nIt became evident during the 1990 series that even though Jordan put up amazing numbers, the Pistons were still wearing on him. This really showed at the end of games. Jordan spent the entire offseason training and lifting.\n\nHe knew he needed to add muscle before another inevitable run in with the Pistons and the âJordan Rulesâ in the playoffs.\n\nIn the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, the Bulls swept the Pistons, finally advancing to the Finals. Jordan had a great series, averaging 29.8 points per game and 7.0 assists per game, most of which went to Scottie Pippen, who had overcome his âmigraine gameâ from the season before.\n\nJust before the end of the last game of the series the Pistons infamous âwalk offâ happened, officially symbolizing the end of the Bad Boys era. In the same way the Pistons had ended the Celtics, the torch had now been passed to Jordan and the Bulls.\n\nJordan and the Bulls went on to win 3 straight championships from 1991-1993. They would also three-peat again from 1996-1998. In both runs, the Bulls faced many great teams, but none challenged them quite like the Pistons.\n\nThe Pistons possessed an elite backcourt that always gave Jordan fits. Isiah and Dumars were stronger than most guards and challenged Michael on the defensive end. In the paint, the Pistons had the personnel that would frighten just about anyone in Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and Dennis Rodman.\n\nMore from PistonPowered\n\nDetroit was also extremely balanced with scoring from Vinnie Johnson, Adrian Dantley, and Mark Aguirre. This balance, combined with the right amount of defensive intensity and grit, was enough to overwhelm Jordan and his supporting cast.\n\nThe other teams that the Bulls faced on their run had the star power, but lacked balance. The Jazz had the combination of John Stockton and Karl Malone. The Sonics possessed a similar one-two punch in Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp.\n\nThe stars would play great, but the Bulls would still tear right through them.\n\nPatrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and even Magic Johnson helplessly watched Jordan destroy their teams possession after possession. Many teams even tried to duplicate the âJordan Rulesâ, but to no avail.\n\nThe Bad Boy Pistons were Jordanâs biggest challenge and made him into the relentless champion that he would turnout to be. In his career, Jordan lost just 7 total playoff series â 3 of which were to the Pistons.\n\nIt will be interesting to tune in to âThe Last Danceâ on Sunday night to learn even more about the intense rivalry between these two teams.\n\nJust remember the rules:Â Anytime Michael goes by you â nail him. Put him on the ground on every drive.\n\nÂ© 2025 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved. The content on this site is for entertainment and educational purposes only.
