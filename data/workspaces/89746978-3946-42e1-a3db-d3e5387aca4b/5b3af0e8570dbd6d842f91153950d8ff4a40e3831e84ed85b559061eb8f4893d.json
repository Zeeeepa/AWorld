One of the defining tests of NBA superstardom is a player’s ability to positively influence his teammates’ play. Stars can improve a teammate’s play through not only their own play, but also their presence; the greatest players of all-time carry an aura with them that embodies winning.\nFour-time NBA champion and Finals MVP LeBron James has illustrated this aura throughout the entirety of his 17-year career. James has the power to thrust his teammates into an unfamiliar position — directly in the spotlight.\nIf these players deliver when they are called upon, their legacies are cemented next to role players like Steve Kerr, whose famous 1997 Finals-winning shot lives on eternally in the Role Player Hall of Fame. Failure to deliver, however, means a player will be exposed to a level of scrutiny unlike ever before. This phenomenon experienced by James’ teammates can be known as the “LeBron Effect.”\n\nNelson Chenault-USA TODAY Sports\nJames’ impact on his teammates is so profound that his influence was felt not just by younger players, but also by accomplished veterans like Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo over last season.\nHere is a look at how James impacted the play of his teammates last season.\n\nHoward, Rondo experience veteran resurgence\nBefore their tenures with the Lakers, it seemed both Howard and Rondo were more destined for stardom in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league than a return to their NBA glory. And while a lack of talent was hardly the issue for either of the former All-NBA selections, accountability was.\nAfter stops in five different cities over the past five seasons, Dwight Howard arrived in Los Angeles on a last-chance deal. Playing alongside James sparked a newfound commitment to winning in Howard. For the first time in his career, he embraced his ideal role as a rim-protecting screen setter.\nEven when Howard was scoring over 20 points a night, he was never a great low post scorer, as most of his offense depended on his otherworldly athleticism. Despite this, Howard adamantly maintained his status among the league leaders in post-ups year after year. During the 2017-18 season (Howard’s last full season before this year), he ranked third in the NBA with 331 field goal attempts off post-ups. Low post scoring requires a soft-touch and grace that has eluded Howard his entire career.\nJames and the Lakers unlocked the optimal version of Howard. Instead of stagnating their offense by throwing the ball into a stationary Howard on the low block, Los Angeles leveraged his athleticism and screen-setting ability. In 69 games this season, Howard only attempted 23 shots out of post-ups.\nWhile Howard deserves credit for making the long-overdue adjustments to his game, it’s impossible to imagine him embracing a limited role off the bench that didn’t come at the James’ behest.\nFor as good as Howard was, Rondo’s resurgence was far more vital to the Lakers’ championship run. James’ greatest impact on Rondo came in the form of trust.\nOne of the hardest parts for any great NBA player is determining what responsibilities they can delegate over the course of 48 minutes. For a player with James’ playmaking prowess, conceding touches in the postseason and allowing a teammate to initiate the offense can be risky. But having an unflappable veteran point guard capable of taking the reins of the offense goes a long way in easing that feeling.\nRondo averaged 6.6 assists per game in the playoffs and served as the guiding hand for the Lakers’ bench units. In Los Angeles’ Game 4 win in the NBA Finals, Rondo orchestrated the pick and roll that ultimately set up Anthony Davis for the game-sealing three with under a minute remaining. Rondo is unafraid of any moment, and following the Lakers’ defeat in Game 5, he took the onus upon himself to put the Miami Heat away in Game 6.\nRondo began the game shooting 5-for-5 as part of a 19-point effort in the series’ closeout game. Aggressive drives in semi-transition opportunities like the one above depict how he sliced through Miami’s defense. As the postseason continued, Rondo looked more comfortable in not only attacking the basket, but also shooting.\nFor the playoffs, Rondo shot 40 percent (20-of-50) from three, a vast improvement for the career 31.6 percent long-range shooter. Although it seems highly unlikely that Rondo’s success from deep will translate over the course of an entire season, the threat of a jump shot alone made Rondo far more dangerous in the pick and roll. Even in the games that he did not shoot well, Rondo remained engaged and did the little things crucial for winning.\n\nEstablishing a name\nWhile James helped redefine the narratives surrounding some of the Lakers veterans’ careers, he also helped shape those of the younger Lakers. Alex Caruso went from a beloved meme on NBA Twitter to an invaluable piece capable of locking down opposing perimeter players and hitting timely shots.\nIn the 560 regular minutes that James and Caruso shared the floor, Los Angeles outscored their opponents by a staggering 18.6 points per 100 possessions. It did not matter who else occupied the other three spots on the floor, as James and Caruso’s presence in a lineup alone ensured the Lakers’ success.\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. While no one has perfected the chase down quite like James, Caruso’s rejection of James Harden on the play below was a visual embodiment of the effort Caruso plays with nightly. Unparalleled energy and passion paired with James’ unwavering confidence in him turned Caruso into a necessary ingredient in the Lakers championship recipe.\nNo Lakers player felt the negative aspects of the LeBron Effect more than Danny Green. In Game 5, James presented Green with his Steve Kerr opportunity, but history had other plans.\nOne missed shot does not define a legacy, but one made shot can. Even though the Lakers still went on to win the series and Green is now a three-time NBA champion, he will likely never get a chance at basketball immortality again. But even for as painful as the miss was, Markieff Morris’ turnover on the play was far more egregious, as James was standing wide open on the wing when Morris heaved the lob pass out of bounds.\nWhile James’ latest Finals victory has breathed new life into the G.O.A.T debate, do not expect his approach to falter. As the King continues chasing the legacy of a ghost in Chicago, he must continue to expect the same greatness he requires of himself from his teammates.\nRead Comments\n\nFind Your Next Springtime Adventure in OregonSpring trails, rushing rivers, and blooming valleys—see it all with a guide.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)\nUndo\nA perfect pour on Oregon’s Food TrailsExperience Oregon’s Food Trails to find award-winning wineries, small-batch breweries and orchard-fresh cider.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)\nUndo\nA Party-Ready PatioThe Spruce| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:) Learn More\nUndo\nExperts Agree—This Little Orange Shot Could Be The Answer To Your Slow DigestionDose| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:) Shop Now\nUndo\nTop 10 worst cities to drive inEvery city has roads we wish were less traveled.

He hopes his legacy influences athletes beyond basketball, shaping their approach to competition and personal growth.Credit: USA Today Sports - ScanpixCredit USA Today Sports - ScanpixLeBron James’ influence spans multiple generations, and his commitment to excellence—both on and off the court—serves as an inspiration for aspiring athletes.LeBron  JamesTeam:Los Angeles LakersPosition:SFAge:40Height:203 cmWeight:113 kgBirth place:Akron, United States of AmericaProfileNewsStatisticsHis definition of success isn’t just about winning; it’s about lifting others up and ensuring the future of the game remains bright.LeBron has long been one of the most dominant figures in basketball, but as his career progresses, his definition of success has evolved.In a recent discussion on the 'Mind the Game podcast' with Steve Nash, James opened up about what success means to him now and how he hopes to leave a lasting impact beyond the game of basketball.For many, success in sports is measured by championships, MVPs, and individual accolades. However, for LeBron, the meaning of success has shifted toward something more profound: inspiring others.“I think it comes down to, like, what does success mean to me now? It’s about inspiring the guys that's with you and the crew that's coming after you,” James said.“Hoping that what you're doing and the tools and the DNA and the blueprint that you're doing while you're still playing and striving while you're doing that, it is going to trickle down to the generation that you're with and the generation that's coming in.”James acknowledges that success is not just about personal achievement but also about paving the way for those who follow. He wants his legacy to extend beyond the hardwood, influencing future athletes in various aspects of life and sport.One of the core philosophies LeBron follows is the idea of leaving the game in a better place than when he entered it. He believes that every generation of players should contribute to the evolution of the sport, ensuring that younger athletes have a strong foundation to build upon.LeBron  JamesMIN:35.06PTS:24.41(56.3%)REB:8.13As:8.39ST:0.98BL:0.59TO:3.81GM:64ProfileNBA2024/2025“We've always heard the saying, like, leave the game in a better place than when you were in it. And that's what success for me is. I hope I can inspire the next generation of great players, great athletes, not only in just basketball, but in sport in general,” James explained.A crucial part of James’ message is the importance of longevity and self-care. As one of the most durable athletes in sports history, LeBron has placed a significant emphasis on maintaining both his physical and mental well-being.“What it means to take care of your body and, you know, keeping your mind fresh and understanding, like, being more driven by the process more than the actual ending goal,” James said.Rather than being solely focused on results, James believes true success lies in the journey—the commitment to self-improvement, discipline, and perseverance. His career is a testament to this mindset, as he continues to perform at an elite level deep into his NBA tenure.Beyond the court, James has built a brand and legacy that extend far beyond his athletic achievements. From philanthropy to business ventures, he has continually demonstrated the importance of creating opportunities that last beyond a playing career.“I hope that I can leave a blueprint for how to take care of your body, how to be a great athlete, and how to be a great teammate, how to build your brand, and how to build your legacy off the court as well,” James said.“It’s bigger than just the game, it’s bigger than just the sport, it’s about living a life that makes people proud, makes your family proud, makes the people that came before you proud.”Full podcast:Thank you for being with us!

He hopes his legacy influences athletes beyond basketball, shaping their approach to competition and personal growth.\n\nLeBron James’ influence spans multiple generations, and his commitment to excellence—both on and off the court—serves as an inspiration for aspiring athletes.\n\nLeBron  James\n\n\n\n\nTeam:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers\n\n\n\nPosition:\nSF\n\n\nAge:\n40\n\n\nHeight:\n203 cm\n\n\nWeight:\n113 kg\n\n\nBirth place:\nAkron, United States of America\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile\nNews\nStatistics\n\nLeBron  James\n\nTeam: | Los Angeles Lakers\nPosition: | SF\nAge: | 40\nHeight: | 203 cm\nWeight: | 113 kg\nBirth place: | Akron, United States of America\nHis definition of success isn’t just about winning; it’s about lifting others up and ensuring the future of the game remains bright.\n\nLeBron has long been one of the most dominant figures in basketball, but as his career progresses, his definition of success has evolved.\n\nIn a recent discussion on the 'Mind the Game podcast' with Steve Nash, James opened up about what success means to him now and how he hopes to leave a lasting impact beyond the game of basketball.\n\nFor many, success in sports is measured by championships, MVPs, and individual accolades. However, for LeBron, the meaning of success has shifted toward something more profound: inspiring others.\n\n“I think it comes down to, like, what does success mean to me now? It’s about inspiring the guys that's with you and the crew that's coming after you,” James said.\n\n“Hoping that what you're doing and the tools and the DNA and the blueprint that you're doing while you're still playing and striving while you're doing that, it is going to trickle down to the generation that you're with and the generation that's coming in.”\n\nJames acknowledges that success is not just about personal achievement but also about paving the way for those who follow. He wants his legacy to extend beyond the hardwood, influencing future athletes in various aspects of life and sport.\n\nOne of the core philosophies LeBron follows is the idea of leaving the game in a better place than when he entered it. He believes that every generation of players should contribute to the evolution of the sport, ensuring that younger athletes have a strong foundation to build upon.\n\nLeBron  James\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIN:\n35.06\n\n\nPTS:\n24.41 (56.3%)\n\n\nREB:\n8.13\n\n\nAs:\n8.39\n\n\nST:\n0.98\n\n\nBL:\n0.59\n\n\nTO:\n3.81\n\n\nGM:\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile\nNBA\n2024/2025\n\nLeBron  James\n\nMIN: | 35.06\nPTS: | 24.41(56.3%)\nREB: | 8.13\nAs: | 8.39\nST: | 0.98\nBL: | 0.59\nTO: | 3.81\nGM: | 64\n“We've always heard the saying, like, leave the game in a better place than when you were in it.

        "raw_content": "How LeBron James changed NBA this decade\n\nFrom the minute LeBron James decided in 2010 to play for the Heat, it was inevitable that nobody would have a bigger impact on the NBA in the following 10 years.\n\nJames, now playing for the Lakers, won championships, MVPs, a gold medal, dominated the Eastern Conference and became a fixture in the NBA Finals in the decade.\n\nHe empowered players, spoke out on basketball and non-basketball issues, created avenues to expand his brand and business in Hollywood and turned his charitable work into meaningful projects that will continue to have an impact long after James is finished playing basketball.\n\nFor all of this and more, James has been voted the athlete of the decade by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHere are five of the ways in which James changed the NBA in the 2010s:\n\nFinals and titles\n\nJames played in eight consecutive Finals, joining a handful of Celtics from the 1950s and 1960s as the only players to accomplish that feat. He won three titles (2012, 2013 and 2016) and delivered memorable performances: a triple-double in a Game 7 victory over Golden State in which the Cavs came back from a 3-1 series deficit, an overtime triple-double in Game 6 against San Antonio to save the Heat from elimination and a 37-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 against the Spurs to clinch a title. He won three Finals MVPs, two regular-season MVPs, a gold medal in 2012 and prevented several teams – Chicago, Indiana, Boston, Atlanta and Toronto – from reaching the Finals. All five of those teams changed coaches after failing to beat James in the playoffs. When he want to Los Angeles, the East exhaled.\n\nBig 3/player empowerment movement\n\nJames pioneered modern-day player empowerment, starting with his decision to form a Big 3 in Miami with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Players play with whom they want and where they want even if that means forcing their way via trade. At the time, James’ move was criticized, but it’s commonplace now and other teams view it as a way to build a championship contender. When James went back to Cleveland in 2014, he joined Kyrie Irving, and the Cavaliers traded for Kevin Love. It happened more organically with Golden State’s Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, but the Warriors still added Kevin Durant in 2016. Last summer, Kawhi Leonard teamed up with Paul George with the Clippers, a move Leonard wouldn’t have made had George not been traded to the Clippers, and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant decided to join up with Brooklyn.\n\nMastery of media\n\nJames hasn’t always been perfect – his much-maligned “The Decision” announcement on ESPN in 2010 being his biggest gaffe. But since then, James has mastered the media landscape, knowing how to use social media, traditional media and his own platform “Uninterrupted” to spread his message. His entertainment company, SpringHill Entertainment, has worked with TV and movie studios to create shows, including \"The Shop\" on HBO and \"Space Jam 2\" with Warner Bros. Today, almost every NBA star uses a form of alternative media (YouTube, Instagram, The Players Tribune) to deliver content to consumers or join large companies on multimedia projects. Durant is an executive producer on ESPN’s \"The Boardroom,\" has a YouTube channel and interacts on Twitter. Curry is developing comedies for TV and the big screen.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nAthletes have been involved in philanthropy long before James, but he took it to another level with his LeBron James Family Foundation. Starting out as a charitable organization that provided free bikes to students who accomplished educational goals, the foundation has grown into something larger than James could’ve even imagined a decade ago. His first major initiative was creating a program in which students who met academic standards would receive free tuition to the University of Akron. His biggest achievement is the I Promise School, a public elementary school for at-risk students in Akron. It opened in 2018 and will continue to grow until it houses grades 3-8 by 2022. James needed basketball to make this happen, but this is much more significant than the game.\n\nSocial and political issues\n\nThe NBA has a history of addressing social issues, dating to the civil rights movement. But there was a bit of a lull in player activism through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. But then Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 in Florida, and James and his Heat teammates wore hoodies for a photo with James tweeting the #WeAreTrayvonMartin hashtag. It marked the beginning of a new era of social and political activism for the NBA. Derrick Rose wore an “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt during pregame warm-ups in support of Eric Garner, an unarmed man who died after an incident with New York police. James also wore one of those shirts and has criticized President Donald Trump on several occasions. With his voice so prominent, his missteps are amplified such as his comments that came off as pro-China just before the start of this season. Even with that, James’ willingness to speak out has helped other athletes do the same.\n\n"

        "raw_content": "ByGlenn Llopis\n\n\n\n4 Transformational Things LeBron James Teaches Us About Leadership And Teamwork\n\nByGlenn Llopis,\n\nContributor.\n\nLeBron James\n\nYou cannot go at leadership alone.  Great teams prevail when they grow and evolve together.\n\nIt’s hard to understand what this really means, until you are put in a position to deliver upon what this entails. For basketball fans, the recent narrative has been that the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the 2018 NBA Finals because LeBron James willed his supreme talents through a supporting cast of mediocrity. But if you know a thing or two about leadership, this is not what has happened.  LeBron James actually willed his leadership through a group of different, yet like-minded teammates that equally wanted to will their ways toward winning a championship.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned their right to the 2018 NBA Finals through the following 4 transformational things LeBron James has taught us all about leadership and teamwork:\n\n1. Spacing and Alignment\n\nWe often refer to spacing on the basketball court as the space that is required to run certain offensive and defensive plays by ensuring that your teammates are in the right spots to successfully execute upon those plays.  This concept of spacing is crucial to leadership success and the effectiveness of high-performance teams – as is requires leaders to give their employees the space to cultivate their ideas and share their ideals with and through others.  Spacing enables leaders and teams to explore endless possibilities centered on their own individual strengths and capabilities.  Spacing is about creating an environment that allows people the room to live with an entrepreneurial spirit – one that focuses on investing in relationships and trusting the value of those relationships that have been intimately cultivated to connect the dots of potential that don’t yet exist into previously unseen opportunities of momentum.\n\nLeBron James is a master at connecting the dots that don’t yet exist. He intimately understands how all of the pieces (teammates) of the puzzle (required solution) work together – with the wisdom to know that the puzzle can change at any time, while the pieces remain the same.  This is the power of creating optimal alignment between leaders and their teams – enabled by the right amount of spacing.\n\n2. Self-Trust and Situational Awareness\n\nThroughout the playoffs, another narrative that has played out is LeBron’s photographic memory, because of his ability to replay in his mind and flawlessly articulate to the media a sequence of plays or happenings that had taken place throughout a game that led to the team’s success or failures.\n\nGreat leaders are constantly replaying in their minds the success factors required to strengthen their situational awareness – especially when the stakes are high and adverse circumstances are overwhelmingly apparent.  During times of tremendous change and transformation this is especially important when you consider that not every leader or every teammate is prepared when circumstances force their hand.  As such, you must train your mind to anticipate the unexpected and this demands a level of courageousness that grows over time by having been exposed to difference circumstances and experiences that allows you to strengthen your mental muscle to elevate confidence into self-trust.\n\nThis is how self-trust is born and is cultivated throughout the span of one’s life and career.  Self-trust is the single most powerful force to strengthen one’s situational awareness as a leader, it gives you the clarity and understanding to know your team and teammates capabilities and what you can and cannot expect from them.\n\nIn 2009, I shared the following wisdom that my father shared with me in my book, Earning Serendipity:  “The wise man forfeits his fortune when he does not trust himself.”  Throughout his 15 year NBA career, LeBron has grown wiser and has learned how to trust himself.  It’s not by chance that he has played his best basketball during his later years.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Lebron James' Off-Court Hustles\n\n\n\n3. Patience and Reinvention\n\nSpeaking of being wiser, wisdom teaches us the importance of patience.  In today’s rapid-paced workplace, patience has become lost in the demands for the immediacy of results.  As such, we rarely appreciate the methods that led to earned success.  One of LeBron James’ most understated skills on the court is the ability to be patient.  Having been crowned “King James,” basketball fans and historians alike expect and demand results (championships) from LeBron.  The pressure to deliver upon these expectations can be overwhelming.  LeBron James has done what most players fail to do enough: continuously reinvent his game (much like Tiger Woods did during his prime).\n\nLeBron constantly refers to taking care of his body and his mind.  While most believe that his pure athleticism and size (6 ft., 8 inches; 280 pounds) is his differentiator, it’s actually what he has done to fuel his mind that has defined his real competitive advantage.  My father used to tell me, “When you fuel your mind with meaningful knowledge each day, it will continue to grow stronger.  When you put it to the test, it will grow wiser.”  LeBron James has conditioned his mind to neutralize external pressure and not allow adversity to disrupt his mindset and ability to perform.  His preparation methods off the court has led to his on the court greatness.\n\nIt has become equally important to be mentally and physically prepared to be a great leader.  Patience and reinvention are crucial to your short and long-term leadership success and your ability to allow your team(s) to create significant outcomes.  Never stop refining your methods.\n\n4. Inclusion and Individuality\n\nLeBron James knows who he is.  When you hear him speak about his teammates, he also knows who they intimately are (there capabilities, their circumstances, their personal and professional history, etc.).  LeBron knows that leadership demands that we reacquaint ourselves with our people.  And when there is employee turnover during times of transformation, you need to take ownership to be part of the solution – not the problem.  LeBron has taught us all that building high-performance leaders and teams demand that we focus on inclusion and the power of individuality.   In other words, you don’t have to spend the most money on talent, nor recruit talent with the best experience, to create winning teams.  You just need to focus more intently on knowing the talent you are recruiting, how they can specifically contribute to building a system that utilizes each individual’s assets for the betterment of the team’s overall success and the organization’s healthier whole.  This approach makes everyone’s success more sustainable.\n\nThis is what the Cleveland Cavaliers did in 2018 when they transformed their roster to give their team a chance to compete for a fourth consecutive NBA finals appearance.  Most would have thought that a fourth consecutive return to The Finals would have been impossible.  But it was through the collaboration of its front office executives and LeBron James’ leadership capabilities (on and off the court) – that the Cleveland Cavaliers created a powerful growth strategy through inclusion and individuality.  Regardless of LeBron’s supreme capabilities, his strengths would not have been as apparent on the court – if each individual was not fully activated and deployed as one cohesive unit.\n\nToday’s leaders must embrace the power of individuality and inclusion.  The speed of change and transformation demands it. Enterprise leadership must stop defining the individual.  This only leads us all down a path of playing not to lose – where complacency ensues.  Leadership in the 21st century is about allowing the individual to influence more and giving them the room to be more inclusive (regardless of hierarchy or rank).  This renewed mindset leads us all down a path of playing to win because the individual desires to be significant for the betterment of a healthier whole.\n\nDeploy your own LeBron James style of leadership that embraces inclusion and recognizes the power of individuality because that’s when possibilities for growth and transformation are unlimited.\n\n\n\n"
