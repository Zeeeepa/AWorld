Comparing players from different eras is incomplete\n\nComparing players from different eras like Michael Jordan and LeBron James to find the NBA GOAT is fun, but a truly impossible task\n\nItâs hard to avoid the debates surrounding which NBA player is the best of all time. The last three eras were championed by Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James, and there is a case to be made for any one of those as the greatest to ever do it in the NBA in the same way that there is a case to be made for Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson.\n\nYour mind might be playing tricks on you, though. Stay with me for a few paragraphs hereâ¦\n\nThe human mind is a wonderful biological specimen, a truly remarkable supercomputer that sits between each of our ears. Just ponder for a moment on how incredible it is that our neurological system is perfectly wired so that when we want to lift our arm, itâs as simple as willing it into action with a thought.\n\nMore from Hoops Habit\n\nTo keep from burning out completely, the human brain takes some shortcuts by compartmentalizing packets of information together in a schema. Usually, those shortcuts serve us well, they prevent us from overthinking and leave brainpower for more important decisions.\n\nWhen you see a chair, your brain doesnât need to wonder what the structure is, thatâs an automatic process. Once it determines it is a chair, typically your brain doesnât do much work to ruminate on the structural integrity of the chair before sitting down.\n\nYour brain sees a chair, a familiar, typical object, and knows it has the option to sit. You simply see a chair and sit down, because the way you interact with a chair is packaged nicely together in a schema within your neurological system. It uses previously compartmentalized information about what chairs are and how they are used and you simply sit with no thought about how to sit or nervousness about whether the chair will support you or not. Your previous experience tells you itâs a chair, itâs meant for sitting.\n\nWhen we think of sports, it seems as though two basketball players should be easily comparable. The schema for basketball players says they are meant for comparing. The news cycle of âwho played betterâ and âwho played worse,â conditions this thought process.\n\nThe compartmentalized information in our mind about Michael Jordan fits the generally same structure of LeBron James. They both are incredible athletes who play in the NBA, and therefore the two things are similar and therefore should be comparable.\n\nItâs like chairs. You might have a stool next to a standard dinner table chair, but your mind essentially sees them as the same thing since they are packaged in the same schema; something that allows you a place to sit, a sense of relief.\n\nOur brains are too quick when it comes to comparing players from different eras, though.\n\nYou see, to preserve brainpower, yes, itâs a logical jump to see Jordan and compare him to James. Similar comparisons with Bryant and Jordan exist and will continue to exist until the end of time.\n\nOur brain sees two likes and wants to compare and contrast.\n\nMore from NBA\n\nThey are not the same, however. Each era is different. Playstyles are different, and the game of basketball has constantly evolved over time with new trends coming in and out of popularity.\n\nWhen Jordan played college basketball, the 3-point line didnât even exist. For Jamesâs career, the 3-point era has pretty much been a defining characteristic of the era in which he played.\n\nHow can we possibly compare the two given that the strategies for teams were completely different? To do so completely ignores the beauty of each era and the unique thread that created the game as we knew it in that specific era. To break down the walls and try to compare players across eras does a disservice to appreciating the ever-changing nature and evolution of the game.\n\nFurthermore, each new trend in the game is further built on the learnings and the practices of the era before it, whether collectively through the data and practicum mined from the large subset of basketball strategy across teams, or on an individual level through mentors and coaches. This, on its own, practically invalidates the credibility to any comparison of players across two eras.\n\nBryantâs quote on Jordan in episode 5 of The Last Dance stands out:\n\nBryant doesnât believe he would be the player he is without the close mentorship of Jordan.\n\nHow can you compare something that is derivative to that which it is derived?\n\nBy very definition, the further the game progresses, the more refined strategy and health sciences get, of course players should be even better (or, at the very least, different) as each era turns over.\n\nLikewise, Jordan provided the blueprint for players like James to brand themselves and start diversifying their revenue streams early on in their careers, providing them more financial flexibility to fortify their training resources.\n\nEach new era is built on that which came before it. Every greatest player of the era faces a unique road of challenges that the greatest of the previous era did not face.\n\nComparing players across eras is fun and worth debating, and weâll continue doing it even though in the back of our minds we probably know itâs an impossible question.\n\nTrust me when I say, though, there is no right answer.\n\nJames to Jordan might feel like a one-to-one comparison because of a schema, itâs absolutely not. A bench might look like a stool because of a schema, itâs absolutely not.\n\nWhat we can appreciate across eras is greatness. The cream of the crop for each era is worth celebrating and pointing to as the mark of excellence for that point in time.\n\nBut it would be pretty silly to compare Albert Einstein to Neil deGrasse Tyson, right?\n\nÂ© 2025 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

Cross-era comparisons are often at the center of NBA discussions, but the style of play in the NBA has changed drastically over time, making it nearly impossible to directly compare players from different eras. In this article, I will analyze how the game of basketball has evolved over time and use this information to discuss two approaches to more accurately compare players from different eras.\n\nHow Has the Style of Basketball Evolved Over Time?\n\nThe style of play in the NBA has undergone drastic changes throughout history due to significant rule changes, technological advancements, and new players and teams that have revolutionized the game. One major rule change was the introduction of the three-point line in the 1979-80 season, which has dramatically changed the game of basketball. While the game didn’t see drastic changes right away with everyone having to adapt to the new rule, the three-point shot now dominates today’s game. The following graph shows the steady increase in three-point volume over time, with the increase becoming more significant in recent years.\n\nToday’s analytically-driven world suggests that three-point shots are far more efficient than mid-range shots, so many teams are hunting for threes by prioritizing spacing and freedom of movement within the offense, which naturally speeds up the pace of the game. Teams like the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors have generated a lot of success within the past decade by running small-ball lineups and shooting a high volume of three-point shots, which has inspired other teams to follow suit.\n\nBy playing a small-ball lineup and replacing the traditional center with another guard or wing, the game becomes much faster because shots are taken quicker during each possession and there is less offensive rebounding, both of which create more possession changes. Mike D’Antoni’s revolutionary “7 seconds or less” offense encapsulates the modern-day style of play, defined by pushing the ball and spacing the floor. Because of the increased volume and success in three-point shots over time, the NBA has also seen an increase in offensive efficiency and pace.\n\nThe pace in the 1970s was extremely high mainly due to sloppy play and an overreaction to the introduction of the shot clock in 1954, as many teams would attempt shots very early in the 24-second clock. As the game became more controlled and pace naturally declined, it eventually reached a time in the late 1990s and early 2000s that was known as a “dead-ball era” characterized by physical defense and grind-it-out offense. There was a lot of isolation basketball where teams sought out one-on-one opportunities. One reason for this was because of illegal defense rules that made it such that defenders had to be near the offensive player they were guarding, making zone defense impossible and restricting help defense. Because of the slow pace and physical brand of basketball, games during this time were extremely low scoring. In 2001, the illegal defense rules were eliminated and the defensive three-second rule was implemented instead. In addition, the time offenses had to get the ball past half-court was reduced from ten seconds to eight. While seemingly minor, this change enticed defenses to press up and pressure the offense in the backcourt which promoted open court action and increased pace. In 2005, banning hand checking was strictly enforced, which decreased the level of physicality allowed by defenders. This played a role in increasing offensive output by giving offensive players more space to operate. Additionally, there was a noticeable spike in pace in the 2018-19 season. This can be attributed to the introduction of the rule that the shot clock resets to 14 seconds on offensive rebounds rather than 24, making teams get back into action quicker following an offensive rebound rather than completely resetting the possession.\n\nAs pace increases and there are more possessions in each game, the games become higher scoring, as depicted by the following graphs.\n\nDue to increases in pace over time, modern-day NBA stats are naturally inflated compared to prior eras like the slow-paced late-1990s, making it unfair to compare individual player statistics from different eras. Many rule changes dating back to the introduction of the three-point line itself have been implemented to create these higher-scoring, faster-paced games in order to attract a larger audience by making the game more entertaining, so the evolution of the game that we are observing is no surprise. While players are undoubtedly becoming more and more skilled as the game evolves, pace is a major factor for why historic NBA records are being broken left and right in today’s modern game.\n\nHow Can We Compare Player’s Across Different Eras?\n\nMethod 1: Adjusting Stats\n\nBecause we cannot directly compare the stats of players who played in different eras due to changes in the style of play, we have to find a way to adjust each player’s stats based on the season they played in such that they are all generalized. To do so, we can first calculate each player’s “per 75 possessions” stats to balance out pace differences across different seasons. “Per 75 possessions” is a good measurement to use because the average star NBA player today plays around 75 possessions per game. However, beyond balancing for pace differences, we must also account for changes in the style of play – in other words – how each possession is used. We can use league average generalized statistics like offensive rating (estimate of points per 100 possessions), as well as assists per 100 possessions and rebounds per 100 possessions for each of the different individual seasons as a whole, then find what percent change each of the statistics has undergone between seasons. We are essentially finding the “inflation factor” between different seasons, then we can use this to adjust a player’s “per 75 possessions” stats accordingly. Aside from the most general statistics like points, rebounds, and assists, we can also account for shooting efficiency by finding the player’s true shooting percentage and comparing it to the league average true shooting percentage for the season they played in to find the player’s relative true shooting percentage. Due to differences in style of play, some eras were more or less efficient than others, so we cannot directly compare the shooting percentages of players from different eras. True shooting percentage effectively assesses a player’s efficiency shooting the ball by adjusting for three-pointers and free throws.\n\nLet’s compare one of the top players from every 5 years between 1980 and 2020 using this method to generalize their stats to 2020 values.\n\nWhile the adjustment does not significantly alter a player’s stats, it makes the stats comparable with other players from different eras to account for changes in pace and style of play. From the first graph, it looks like the player stats all become relatively close despite how different some of the eras were in terms of play style. Two things that stand out even after adjusting the stats are Giannis’ all-around output in 2020-21 and Steph Curry’s scoring efficiency in his unanimous MVP season. While we do need to take modern-day player stats with a grain of salt due to the extremely fast-paced, high-scoring nature of today’s game, it’s clear that we can’t discount the unprecedented play we are seeing from generational talents like Steph Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\nReggie Miller vs Klay Thompson\n\nWe can also use this method to look at a more specific comparison between two players like Klay Thompson and Reggie Miller who are widely considered to be two of the greatest shooters of all time.\n\nKlay Thompson was a notable snub from the NBA’s 75th Anniversary Team and many people argued that Klay deserved Miller’s spot on the list because Klay boasts a higher career scoring average and higher career shooting percentage to go along with his four championships. However, Miller played much of his career during the dead-ball era, so his real performance is much more impressive than what his general statistics may suggest, especially compared to the numbers that modern-day players are putting up day-in and day-out.\n\nAfter adjusting their stats, Reggie Miller’s adjusted points per game becomes higher than Klay’s in their respective seasons, even though he technically averaged less points per game. In addition, Miller’s relative shooting efficiency is much higher compared to Klay for both three-pointers specifically and true shooting percentage as a whole, setting them apart.\n\nSteve Nash vs Tyrese Haliburton\n\nAnother interesting player comparison to make is Steve Nash from his 2005-06 MVP season with Tyrese Haliburton thus far in the 2022-23 NBA season. Nash averaged 18.8 points and 10.5 assists per game in his 2005-06 MVP season, while Haliburton has averaged 19.1 points and 10.9 assists in 22 games so far this season. Haliburton’s numbers stand out as they are seemingly better than a former MVP’s stats, but we have to first adjust the stats to account for changes in the style of play between the different eras before jumping to any conclusions.\n\nAfter adjustment, we see that Nash’s point and assist averages become higher than Haliburton’s, although they are still close. Digging further, we see that Nash’s shooting efficiency sets him apart from Haliburton. Nash had a 50/40/90 season that year (over 50% from the field, over 40% from three, and over 90% from the free throw line) and posted a true shooting percentage 10.3% better than league average, whereas Haliburton is just about league average in that department. Additionally, Nash orchestrated a Suns offense that averaged a league best 108.6 points per game during that season and won 54 games, which definitely added to his MVP case. While Haliburton has been tremendous so far this season, this comparison helps us understand what sets Steve Nash’s 05-06 MVP season apart from what Haliburton has done thus far this season, something that is hard to tell by just comparing their general stats.\n\nMethod 2: Comparing Relative Dominance\n\nAnother way we can compare players from different eras is by analyzing how much a player dominated their respective era and comparing different players’ level of dominance. The way we can do this is by finding the league average player stats for a given season and finding the standard deviation for each of the stats, then finding how many standard deviations away from the mean the player of interest was for each of the stats. The more standard deviations away from the mean a player is, the more dominant they were.\n\nMichael Jordan vs LeBron James vs Kobe Bryant\n\nUsing this method, let’s compare the age-27 seasons of Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant. Between Jordan, LeBron, and Kobe, there’s a lot of debate about who is the “GOAT” but it’s hard to reach a consensus decision because they played in different eras.\n\nThis graph suggests that Kobe Bryant scored the most, LeBron James was the most well-rounded, and Michael Jordan was the most efficient scorer.\n\nMagic Johnson vs Stephen Curry vs Oscar Robertson\n\nLet’s also compare the relative dominance of Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, and Stephen Curry, three of the best point guards of all time.\n\nSince they all played during drastically different eras, it’s difficult to compare them and reach a consensus decision about who was actually the best. Let’s compare each of their best MVP seasons: Curry in 2015-2016, Magic in 1986-1987, and Oscar in 1963-1964.\n\nThis graph suggests that Oscar and Magic dominated their eras with their passing, recording unprecedented assist numbers for their time. Curry still posted assist numbers nearly 3 standard deviations higher than the mean, but he dominated with his scoring and efficiency – which makes sense since he’s widely regarded as the greatest shooter the NBA has ever seen. Interestingly, while Oscar and Magic are more well-known for their rebounding ability compared to Curry, their rebounding stats are not significantly greater than Curry’s when we account for the context of their different eras.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the comparison between players across eras will never be perfect, we can attempt to make them as accurate as possible by adjusting their stats to account for changes in the NBA’s style of play or comparing their relative dominance by analyzing how much a player dominated their respective era. However, much more should be taken into consideration than just points, rebounds, assists, and shooting percentages. Ideally, we would dig into more advanced stats and consider other factors like defense and team contributions to make these comparisons even more in-depth. Still, the two analysis methods we performed can provide a lot of additional insight about how players from different eras stack up. The next time a new record is broken or a cross-era comparison emerges, it’s important to first consider the evolution of basketball before jumping to conclusions.\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.basketball-reference.com/\n\nRecent Posts\n\nBruin Sports Analytics\n\nData Journalism\n\nResearch\n\nConsulting\n\nOfficers\n\nApply\n\nContact\n\nMore\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nBSA Newsletter\n\nThanks for submitting!\n\nContact Us\n\nbruinsportsanalyticsclub@gmail.com\n\n"

With other teams clearly ahead of the Lakers in the pursuit of a championship, the clock of father time is in the early stages of ticking on LeBron’s career.\nOne factor must be considered though when comparing arguably the two greatest players in NBA history:\nWho faced better competition?\nYes, Michael Jordan obviously went 6-0 in the Finals and LeBron sits at 3-6. But there are other factors to consider here: if Jordan’s Bulls were in today’s era instead would they even stand a chance against the Warriors? So let’s take a look at the overall picture, and emphasize 6 hurdles each player had to experience on their way to greatness.\nMichael Jordan Competition\n1. Larry Bird\nWhen Jordan first entered the league in 1984, Larry Bird was smack dab in his prime. MJ was injured for most of his 2nd season in 1985-1986, but when he returned in time for the playoffs he showed his first signs of greatness against one of the greatest teams in NBA history.\nJordan put up an NBA playoff record 63 points in the Boston Garden in an overtime loss to the Celtics in the 1st round of the playoffs. The Bulls were eventually swept in this series, but this game proved to be the beginning of a path towards greatness.\n2. Detroit Pistons\nThe Bad Boys deserve their own category. The Pistons late 80’s success combined with giving Jordan trouble I believe was absolutely crucial in developing Jordan’s killer instinct that would fully blossom in the ’90s.\nIsiah Thomas and Joe Dumars obviously combined for a hall of fame backcourt, but the other players on this team really pushed Jordan in his early career failures. Bill Laimbeer, Rick Mahorn, and future teammate Dennis Rodman helped form a tenacious attitude and identity for this team that became so legendary they even got their own 30 for 30 documentary.\nThe future path to success was set early for Jordan and this team provided the most difficult obstacle in his basketball career.\n3. Magic Johnson\nJordan’s first championship came in 1991, defeating the post showtime Lakers led by Magic Johnson in his last elite season. Johnson won multiple championships in the ’80s, and the 1991 NBA Finals series in retrospect became a somewhat passing of the torch.\nMJ’s flair was fully on display for the world to see, including the most iconic layup in history which would be replicated by kids playing in the backyard throughout the decade.\nMagic Johnson is a top 10 player of all time and Jordan being able to triumph over him early on his quest to 5 more championships after setting the tone for the ’90s.\n4. Clyde Drexler, Hakeem Olajuwon & Charles Barkley\n\nOn his quest for greatness, Michael Jordan won his 2nd championship ring against the Portland Trail Blazers and his 3rd against the Phoenix Suns.\nClyde Drexler if not for Jordan would likely be considered the best SG of the ’80s and early ’90s. If Drexler were not on the Blazers in 1984 there is a very good chance Jordan would have been in Portland. Drexler eventually built his resume when he joined forces with Hakeem in Houston while Jordan was on a baseball hiatus and the Rockets won back to back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nCharles Barkley remains one of (if not the) greatest players to never win an NBA championship. He came closest in 1992-1993 when he was MVP of the league but he just happened to run into the Jordan train and fell short.\n5. Shaquille O’Neal, Penny Hardaway, Gary Payton & Shawn Kemp\n\nJordan returned to the Bulls in 1995, and what is now somewhat forgotten is the fact that the Shaq/Penny led Orlando Magic upended the Bulls in the 1995 playoffs. This was the only year in the ’90s that Jordan lost in the playoffs, and set an early tone for how the rest of Shaq’s career would play out.\nMichael Jordan returned to form the next season, with his team posting a 72-10 regular season record. The Mega Bulls ran into Gary Payton and the Seattle Supersonics in the 1996 NBA Finals. Payton, one of the all-time greatest trash talkers in league history, led the Sonics to put up a respectable fight vs. the Bulls only to lose 4-2 in the series.\n6. Karl Malone & John Stockton\nMichael Jordan’s final 2 championship triumphs’ came against the Utah Jazz in the 1997/1998 NBA Finals. Utah built up one of the most impressive small market teams in league history and the long term chemistry of Malone/Stockton gave these Bulls teams fits.\nThe Bulls won a ring in 1997 and ultimately Jordan hit the most iconic shot in league history in game 6 of the 1998 Finals, crossing over Byron Russell and sending the Jazz into defeat as Jordan won his 6th NBA ring of the decade.\nRead More\nTop 15 Players With The Most Trophies In NBA History\nMichael Jordan’s 6 Rings Are Better Than Bill Russell’s 11 Rings\nTop 10 Best Scorers In NBA History\nLeBron James Competition\n1. The Spurs\n\nLike MJ, the first section of LeBron’s argument is a team instead of players. I would argue LeBron leading the 2007 Cavs to the NBA Finals at 22 years old is the most impressive feat in NBA history. With his surrounding cast, that team had zero business sniffing a Finals appearance and did.\nUltimately, Tim Duncan and the Spurs proved too much and swept the Cavs 4-0. This taught LeBron an early NBA lesson in the school of hard knocks.\nThis team would come back to give LeBron fits the next decade as well. The Miami Heat faced off against the Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 NBA Finals going 1-1 against this team, and if not for a miracle Ray Allen 3 point shot they very well could have gone 0-2.\nStill, the 2013 victory against a Spurs team with ridiculous chemistry is impressive and helped build the King of Akron’s legacy.\n2. Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen & Dwight Howard\n\nOver the next couple of seasons to end the 2000’s decade LeBron never reached the finals again. Paul Pierce, KG, and Ray Allen joined forces to form a super team and won the 2008 championship. Dwight Howard also was becoming one of the most impressive young centers in NBA history and led the Orlando Magic to the Finals in 2009.\n3. Kobe Bryant\n\nOne of the biggest what if’s in NBA history is Kobe and LeBron never meeting in the Finals, but Kobe deserves his own category here. The biggest debate of 2008-2011 was Kobe or LeBron. Kobe was solidifying his greatness on the way to 5 championship rings while LeBron was proving himself to possibly be the most impressive young player in league history.\nKobe showed his mamba mentality that LeBron would carry with him once he went to the Heat.\n4. Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony & Chris Bosh\n\nThe 2003 draft is arguably the greatest in league history. LBJ entered the league at the same time as these 3 other future hall of famers, and he would join forces with 2 of them in South Beach for an early 2010’s dynasty.\nWade won a ring in 2006 as a young player on the Heat, and his championship mentality helped build King James into the player that he is today. Shout out to Chris Bosh as well who is a highly underrated part of that early 2010’s Heat run.\n5. The Warriors\n\nMandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nLeBron’s competition in his 30’s can be summarized by one team: The Warriors.\nThis is a team that likely stopped LeBron from easily being considered the greatest player of all time. LeBron and the newly recharged Cavaliers faced Golden State in the Finals 4 straight seasons, finishing 1-3.\nThat one win in 2016 was impressive though and arguably the most dominant Finals performance in NBA history. In terms of LeBron and MJ facing competition, this team is the hardest competition either of them faced and there is zero doubt about that.\n6. The Future\nWith LeBron’s career still ongoing, there will be future hurdles for him to navigate through and this debate is not finished.\nStill 34 years old and playing at an elite level, King James is still in control of his destiny and it remains to be seen whether the Warriors dynasty will last through the remainder of his career.\nWill Anthony Davis join forces with LeBron to become instant contenders? Will Kawhi move back to the states and sign with the Lakers in 2019 free agency?\nA lot could happen and it’ll be interesting to see what type of competition LeBron will have to face the rest of his career.\n\n\n\n\nFADEAWAY WORLD NEWSLETTER\nIn-Depth Analysis,\nUnrivaled Access.\nGet Fadeaway World's\nBest Stories, 3 Days a Week.\nSign Up Now\nNewsletter ----------\nStay up to date with our newsletter on the latest news, trends, ranking lists, and evergreen articles\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nDetroit Pistons Trade Rumors\nDetroit Pistons Land Jimmy Butler In 'Nothing To Lose' Mock Trade Scenario With Miami Heat ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nClippers Trick Lakers With A Huge Trap In Proposed Trade Idea -------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nHeat Notes: Jimmy Butler Trade Saga Continues, Pat Riley Has Offers On The Table --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 15, 2025\n\nMiami Heat News & Analysis\nTyler Herro Gives Perfect Response To Pat Riley's \"Fragile\" Comment -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Gautam VarierJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Nuggets Overpower Mavericks In Latest Blowout Win -------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 15, 2025\n\nDenver Nuggets News & Analysis\nGrading Nuggets Players After Dominant 118-99 Victory Against Shorthanded Mavericks -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Eddie BitarJan 15, 2025\n\nPhoenix Suns News & Analysis\nInstant Analysis: Suns Fall Below .500 In Dreadful Loss To Hawks ----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nGolden State Warriors News & Analysis\nSteve Kerr Makes A Statement Amid Ongoing Struggles: \"Sometimes The Right Thing Is To Not Do Anything...\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nMiami Heat Have Recieved 'Multiple Trade Offers' For Jimmy Butler -----------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nToronto Raptors News & Analysis\nPaul George: Raptors Should Retire Kawhi, DeRozan, And Lowry's Jerseys ----------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nOklahoma City Thunder News & Analysis\nJalen Williams Calls For NBA To Introduce 2 Defensive Player Of The Year Awards -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nMiami Heat Trade Rumors\nJimmy Butler Is Frustrated With The Heat For Not Getting Him Any Help While East Rivals Add Superstars ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Ishaan BhattacharyaJan 14, 2025\n\nNBA News & Analysis\nChandler Parsons Says Kevin Durant Is Above Kobe Bryant On The NBA's All-Time Hierarchy ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Nico MartinezJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Trade Rumors\nWild Trade Proposal Sends LeBron James To Warriors; Lakers Get Four Players And First-Round Pick ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBy Vishwesha KumarJan 14, 2025\n\nLos Angeles Clippers News & Analysis\nKawhi Leonard On Palisades Fire: \"Everybody Is Not Okay.
