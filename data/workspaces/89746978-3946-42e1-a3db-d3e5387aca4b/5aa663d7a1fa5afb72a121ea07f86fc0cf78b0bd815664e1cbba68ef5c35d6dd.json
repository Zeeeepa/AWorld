Here are three of The King's top clutch moments.\n\nDijo Songco\n\nLeBron James is arguably one of the best athletes to ever play in the NBA. After successful playoff runs, multiple MVP's and a handful of championships to boot, LeBron has already successfully cemented himself in the league's Mt. Rushmore alongside legends like Magic, Bird, Kobe, Kareem and MJ.  It's no question that LBJ was born with a clutch gene and he's displayed this time and time again in the NBA's biggest stage, the Playoffs.\n\nHere are three of The King's top clutch moments.\n\n3. Game 5 vs The Washington Wizards (2006)\n\n\n\nAfter just three years in the league, LeBron was able to turn the Cleveland Cavaliers' franchise around. James brought the Cavs back to the playoffs after almost a decade.  His first-ever playoff matchup was against Gilbert Arenas and the Washington Wizards. The series was tied at two a piece which set the stage for LeBron to take over. The game was on his hands in the 4th quarter but a few mistakes by the young 21-year-old brought the game to overtime. In the dying moments of the game, Arenas made two free throws to bring the Wizards up by one with just three seconds to go. With the game on the line, LeBron drove baseline and went against four Wizards defenders and converted the game-winning basket. LeBron went on to win his first ever playoff series against the Wizards, 4-2.\n\n2. Game 7 vs. The San Antonio Spurs (2013)\n\n\n\nIn his second year with the Miami Heat, LeBron with his other “big-three” mates Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh brought the Heat back to defend their 2012 crown against Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs. It seems that the Spurs was about to win it all in Game 6 until Ray Allen hit one of the most unforgettable shots in NBA Finals history to bring the series to a penultimate Game 7. After years of non-stop criticism about LeBron's 4th quarter appearances, the 2013 MVP silenced all critics with a masterful performance in the final 12 minutes of the series.  He finished the fourth quarter with 16 points at a 7-11 shooting clip. One of the highlights of the game was a jumper from the elbow with 28 seconds left in the clock to bring the Heat up by four. Miami went on to win the game 95-88 capping off LeBron's first back-to-back NBA title.\n\n1. Game 7 vs. The Golden State Warriors (2016)\n\n\n\nThe block. One of James' trademarks would definitely be his chase-down blocks; and this was definitely at the top of the list. After beating the LeBron's Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors were starting to wreak havoc in the NBA. With their star Stephen Curry leading the way, all signs pointed to an evident dynasty for the squad from the Bay Area. Not on The King's watch, though. The Cavs fought back from a 3-1 deficit and set-up another Game 7 duel. With two-minutes left in the fourth quarter, the score was tied and it was anybody's game at that point. After a missed shot from Kyrie Irving, Andre Iguodala grabbed the board and started to run a 2-on-1 fastbreak with Curry. LeBron came out of nowhere and galloped his way back to chase down Iguodala's layup. And the rest, as they say, is history. LeBron was finally able to bring home a championship to Cleveland. With this series-saving block, LeBron single-handedly put a dent to the Warriors' dominance in the league, pun intended.\n\nDijo Songco is a writer for ClutchPoints.\n\n🚨 Get viral NBA graphics, memes, rumors and trending news\n    delivered right to your inbox with the Clutch Newsletter.\n\n"

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Chicago Bulls, Eastern Conference Semifinals, Game 4, 2015\n\nThis was the first playoffs after LeBron James rejoined the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2014.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic, Eastern Conference Finals, Game 2, 2009\n\nIn 2009, a 24-year-old LeBron James came close to reaching his 2nd NBA Finals.

        "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"
