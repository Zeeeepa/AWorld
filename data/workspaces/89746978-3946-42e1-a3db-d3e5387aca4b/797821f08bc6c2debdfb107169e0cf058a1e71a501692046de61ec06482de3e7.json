Throughout his illustrious career he has seen both highs and lows, whilst providing the basketball community with unforgettable performances for the ages. Therefore, I have tasked myself with the impossible mission of ranking, specifically, his top 5 playoff performances.\n\nTo rank a player’s performance in the NBA, let alone, LeBron James, is no small task. Therefore, to assist in being able to categorise and create an objective ranking, a set of criteria will be utilised to meet the aim of creating an accurate ranking.\n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n\nEach facet will be measured out of a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best and 0 the worst. The total will be ranked and measured out of a scale of 50.\n\n5. 2020 Finals Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 44/50\n\nIn a closeout game with the Lakers looking to finish off the Miami Heat and lay claim to the 2020 NBA title, LeBron James was determined as ever to get another championship on his third team. The King poured in 40 points on an unbelievable 71.4 FG%, on top of this, he managed to pull down 13 rebounds and dished out 7 assists.\n\nPlaying out of his traditional Small Forward position that he has played throughout the majority of his career, and instead at the helm of the Lakers offense as the teams point guard. The high usage, touches and ultimately responsibility further emphasis how impressive of a performance he delivered in game 5, particularly, in respect to his overall efficiency.\n\nIn the end, Game 5 came down to the wire as the infamous playoff riser, Jimmy Butler, served the Lakers an ice cold 35-point triple double. The Heats defence, a Danny Green missed shot (wide open), coupled with Jimmy’s heroics put the Lakers away in the do-or-die game for the Heat. Thus, like many of LeBron’s iconic performances, the team could not match his level of effort to pull out the win.\n\n4. 2007 ECF Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 46/50\n\nAt just 22 years old, willing a poorly constructed Cavaliers roster to heights beyond anyones expectations. This performance could be considered the genesis of the legend of LeBron, where he looked like a kid playing at the local park, a video game character, mythical, to say the least.\n\nJames’ performance against the rough and tough Detroit Pistons is defined by the staple closing period of the game, where James went unconscious by putting 25 straight points on the board to edge the Cavs over the Pistons, this would position the Cavs 3-2, in an eventual series win, proving to be the pivotal moment, not only in the game but the series.\n\nThe momentum changing game would provide the Cleveland Cavaliers with a franchise first NBA Finals appearance. A historical achievement, that in hindsight, adds further weight and significance to the feats LeBron reached during game 5.\n\nIt’s not common that young superstars display such dominance, maturity and responsibility in their game, but LeBron James was able to do just that in his showing during Game 5. A performance that has yet to be toppled by the rising stars of the NBA since.\n\n3. 2012 ECF Game 6\n\nPerformance score: 47/50\n\nAt the time of Game 6, LeBron was down a 3-2 deficit to the dynastic Boston Celtics of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This series was on the back of the disaster showing in the previous seasons final, where the Heat fell to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt was a legacy game, a turning point in LeBron’s career. If they lost, would the Heat have to rethink things over and blow it up? Is LeBron capable of leading a team to the mountain top? All these questions and much more loomed over the team like a dark cloud.\n\n\n\nUnrelenting, and defiant in preserving the Miami Heat, who were on a lifeline at this point in the series. LeBron, as seen in the thumbnail image above, had a look in his eye, only comparable to a lion stalking its prey. He attacked the Boston Celtics with brute force, finesse fadeaways from the mid-post and athletic finishes around the rim.\n\nHe silenced the Celtics superteam and the raging home crowd with 45-points on 73.1% shooting, along with 15 rebounds and 5 assists. A performance that turned down the volume on the critics within the media and NBA fanbase, and proved that nothing was going to deter LeBron from getting his first ring.\n\nThis infamous game lives on as one of the most iconic games of his career, and arguably one of the greatest performances of all time.\n\n2. 2016 Finals Game 7\n\nPerformance score: 49.5/50\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the greatest NBA game of all time, the historic series comeback by the Cavaliers, scratching and clawing their way back into the series after being knocked down 3-1, against the greatest regular season team of all time.\n\nThe unquantifiable pressure emanating from Oracle Arena on June 19, 2016 could be felt through television screens halfway around the world. The stakes couldn’t get any higher, it was up to the stars to prove to the world whether they could step into the limelight. An underlying narrative was that LeBron had promised to raise a banner for the city of Cleveland, in his return from his Miami Heat stint. More pressure than ever was on Jame to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he did. The King produced an all around masterclass, a 27 point triple-double. Additionally, an amazing stat to put into perspective just how important James was during the crucial game is that he contributed to 50% of the Cavaliers points directly, either by assist or scoring (27 points, 19 points created from assists). The unreal offensive control was complemented by stellar defense, which birthed the iconic and arguably greatest highlight of LeBron’s career “The Block”.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to not place this as the greatest game of his career due to the unreal performance on both sides of the floor, the stakes and ultimately, the outcome of the iconic game.\n\n1. 2018 Finals Game 1\n\nPerformance score: 50/50\n\nIn a series that perfectly emulates the biblical story of David versus Goliath, LeBron James established a new precedent with his Game 1 performance. Before the series began, many within the media and broader NBA community assumed that the Golden State Warriors would trample over the one man army Cavaliers in dominant and blown-out fashion. Despite the series ending in a sweep, it was held much closer than pundits anticipated, largely due to James’ historic play.\n\nIn Game 1, LeBron showed utter offensive domination, with balanced inside-out scoring throughout the competition. He finished the game with a jaw-dropping 51 points (playoff career high), to go along with a near triple double of 8 rebounds and 8 assists. On top of this, he shot 43% from the 3-point range and 59% as a whole from the field. It was the cherry on top of the cake in terms of performances during his historical 2018 playoff season run.\n\nTherefore, this performance ranks as his best in my opinion, and the greatest NBA Finals performance of all time because:\n\nShare this:\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n"

        "raw_content": "Top 10 LeBron James' NBA Playoff games\n\nLeBron James is easily a top-3 player in the history of the NBA Playoffs, which makes ranking his 10 greatest games an arduous task for anyone. The King has dominated the NBA in recent times, unlike any other player.\n\nEarly in his career, it was all about his athleticism and carefree abandon that came with youth. With experience, he became a more lethal player, as he used a combination of his world-class athleticism and analytical mind to outhink and outmanoevre opponents.\n\nOn that note, let us have a look at 10 such games in the NBA Playoffs, where LeBron James produced his most memorable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeBron James' ten greatest games in the NBA Playoffs\n\nLeBron James is the undisputed greatest active player in the NBA and arguably one of the greatest of all time. Unsurprisingly, he has often reserved his best for the business end of the competition - the NBA Playoffs.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe King, as LeBron James is often known as, is an all-time great NBA playoff performer and also the all-time leader in games played (282). From such a significant sample size, it is indeed a challenging proposition to handpick a few games as he has had memorable performances galore.\n\nNevertheless, let us have a look at LeBron James' 10 best performances in the NBA Playoffs. Without further ado, let's get started.\n\n#10 LeBron James vs OKC Thunder - Game 4 (2012 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 26 points | 12 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 10/20 FG | 44 minutes\n\nDespite his unquestionable talent and pedigree, LeBron James was surprisingly ringless when he arrived in the 2012 NBA Playoffs against OKC Thunder. But that would change by the end of that finals series.\n\nThe 2012 NBA #Finals MVP - LeBron James!  http://t.co/SlHygrml\n\nIn the fourth game of that series against the Thunder, the Miami Heat were up 2-1 but needed to increase their lead in Miami before going back to OKC for the final two games of the series.\n\nA win by OKC in Miami would have meant that the series would have been decided in the former's home, but LeBron James managed to ensure that that did not happen. OKC's best chance to win a game in Miami was in that fourth game of the series, but LeBron James, despite struggling with physical issues in the fourth quarter, had other ideas.\n\nAfter getting afflicted by cramps in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter, LeBron James returned to the court and hit his only three-point shot of the night when the scores were tied at 94-all.\n\nIt was a shot in the arm for the Miami Heat, who went on to close the game with a 12-4 run to take a 3-1 lead in the series. In the next game of the series, Miami blew OKC off the floor, as LeBron James won his first NBA title and was also named the Finals MVP.\n\n#9 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 7 (2018 ECF)\n\nStats: 35 points | 9 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 blocks | 12/24 FG | 48 minutes\n\nIn his last season to date playing for an Eastern Conference team, LeBron James dominated the 2018 Eastern Conference Playoffs despite not having a great supporting cast around him (at least while facing a Western Conference team in the finals).\n\n33.9 PPG8.9 RPG8.8 APGLeBron James came to play in the 2018 #NBAPlayoffs! 🏀: #WhateverItTakes x #CUsRise GAME 7 ⏰: 8:30pm/et 📺:@ESPNNBA pic.twitter.com/YdZeo4W0Lb\n\nIn the deciding game of that year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James had a memorable night in front of a Boston crowd who witnessed The King's prowess first hand.\n\nLeBron James played every minute of the Cleveland Cavaliers' 87-79 victory on the road against the Celtics. Despite a high number of turnovers (eight), James had an incredible night.\n\nWith Boston up by one point entering the fourth quarter, LeBron James scored 12 in the deciding period on 4/6 from the field and dished out four assists to reach his ninth NBA Finals, his eighth on the trot.\n\n#8 LeBron James vs Indiana Pacers - Second Round - Game 4 (2012 NBA Playoffs)\n\nStats: 40 points | 9 assists | 18 rebounds | 2 steals | 2 blocks | 14/27 FG | 44 minutes\n\nLeBron James' run to his first NBA championship in the 2012 NBA Playoffs was characterised by pressure, which the player experienced every game.\n\nA Decade of Dominance!@KingJames & Miami climb to the top in 2012 & 2013 (via @SekouSmithNBA): https://t.co/8RYwcSaMZX pic.twitter.com/z6hw8fIsWh\n\nIn the second round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, LeBron James and the Heat were down 2-1 against the Indiana Pacers after losing two games in a row and scoring only 75 points in each match.\n\nIn game four at Indiana, the pressure was at a crescendo because the team had failed the year before and was close to faltering in the NBA Playoffs again.\n\nNevertheless, LeBron James destroyed the Pacers with his first 40-point game in the NBA Playoffs for the Heat. That tied the series at two-all. There was more pressure against the Boston Celtics in the Conference semi-finals before LeBron James and the Miami Heat managed to go all the way.\n\n#7 LeBron James vs Miami Heat - Game 6 (2020 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 28 points | 10 assists | 14 rebounds | 1 turnover | 13/20 FG | 41 minutes\n\nIn his most recent game in his NBA Playoffs career - Game 6 of the 2020 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat - LeBron James reinforced his claim for a place among the NBA's all-time greats.\n\nThe 2020 Bill Russell #NBAFinals MVP... LeBron James of the @Lakers! #LakeShow pic.twitter.com/jyAko4pjbN\n\nLeBron James led the LA Lakers' to a 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat to help secure the franchise's record-equalling 17th NBA title. In the process, James won his fourth ring to go with his fourth Finals MVP award which he won with a third different team (the only player to ever do so).\n\nJames rose to the fore when he was required the most to seal the title for the Lakers in a difficult year for the city and the franchise.\n\nThe player capped his tenth NBA Finals by averaging 30 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists on 59% shooting from the field and 42% from the three. Arguably, that was James' greatest ever performance, in terms of stats, in an NBA Finals/NBA Playoffs series.\n\n#6 LeBron James vs Detroit Pistons - Game 5 (2007 ECF)\n\nStats: 48 points | 7 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 50 minutes\n\nThis was LeBron James' greatest game in his career in the NBA Playoffs for many, which came against the Detroit Pistons in game five of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIf anyone needed further proof of LeBron James' arrival among the NBA's elite in history, they need not look further than this game. LeBron James is called 'The King' for several reasons, one of them being his performances in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nAgainst one of the greatest defensive teams of the modern era, James put up an amazing performance to get a double-overtime win for the Cavs, who took a 3-2 lead before wrapping up the series at home in game six.\n\nLeBron James scored the last 25 points for Cleveland in his first-ever appearance in an ECF against a team that was playing their fourth consecutive ECF and had won the NBA title in 2004 and reached the NBA Finals in 2005.\n\n#5 LeBron James vs Denver Nuggets - Game 5 (2020 WCF)\n\nStats: 38 points | 10 assists | 16 rebounds | 15/25 FG | 40 minutes\n\nWith the LA Lakers up 3-1 in the 2020 Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, the talk in the series was about Denver, as they had returned from 3-1 deficits in the previous two rounds of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nHowever, it was obvious that LeBron James would put an end to that narrative because those things have never happened to him in the NBA Playoffs. Lack of a killer instinct in the NBA Playoffs? No, James is simply different.\n\nIn game five, the Nuggets were hanging well with the Lakers, as they did in most games in that series (James was not having his greatest series at that point).\n\nLeBron James then took the game by the scruff of its neck in the fourth quarter, scoring 16 points on 7/10 shooting from the field to close the series and advance to his tenth NBA Finals, his ninth in the last ten years.\n\n#4 LeBron James vs San Antonio Spurs - Game 7 (2013 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 37 points | 4 assists | 12 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 5/10 3P | 45 minutes\n\nIn his first-ever game seven in an NBA Finals, LeBron James handled the pressure well to win back-to-back titles (after winning an epic game six). In this game, James proved that his perimeter shooting was good enough on the biggest of stages.\n\nIn the entire series, the Spurs gave up mid-range and three-point shots to LeBron James as a defensive tactic, trying to reduce James' impact when he entered the paint to find open shots for his teammates.\n\nThe ploy worked to an extent, as the San Antonio Spurs took a 3-2 lead and were certainly in a position to close the Heat out in game six before Ray Allen's all-time iconic shot tied the game, and Miami eventually took an OT win.\n\nJames made five of his ten attempts from the three in the deciding game after making only seven of 24 in the first six. His three-point range and a mid-range jump shot, with the Heat up by two points with 28 seconds remaining, sealed the game in Miami's favor.\n\nLeBron James also scored nine points in the fourth quarter to give the Heat back-to-back NBA championships. He earned his second Finals MVP too to close out a tremendous 2013 NBA Playoffs run.\n\n#3 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 6 (2012 ECF)\n\nStats: 45 points | 5 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/26 FG | 45 minutes\n\nIn easily his most efficient and impactful game of his NBA Playoffs career, LeBron James dominated the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden with one of the NBA's best individual performances ever seen.\n\nThis was a ring-less LeBron James facing a team that had won the NBA championship in 2008 and played in the Finals in 2010, both times eliminating James' team in the NBA Playoffs along the way.\n\nThis time, James' team was certainly the more favored, one but Boston won three straight games to take a 3-2 lead. With home court advantage in game six, it was looking good for the Doc Rivers-coached team.\n\nHowever, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen had to experience one of their toughest losses during their tenure together in the NBA Playoffs. James scored 30 points (12/14 FG) in the first half to put the Heat up 55-42 after 24 minutes.\n\nHe then made timely shots in the second half to break Boston's heart before shutting down their comeback attempts with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists on 73% shooting. In game seven, the Heat overwhelmed Boston again to reach the 2012 NBA Finals, where LeBron James won his first NBA title.\n\n#2 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 6 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 41 points | 11 assists | 8 rebounds | 4 steals | 16/27 FG | 42 minutes\n\nThe 2016 NBA Finals was LeBron James' greatest series in his legendary NBA Playoffs career.\n\n#2 | TOP 20 CLUTCH PLAYS - 2010s🚫 \"OH, BLOCKED BY JAMES!\" 🚫@KingJames comes out of nowhere for the INCREDIBLE CHASEDOWN BLOCK in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA FINALS, sending the @cavs to their first-ever NBA championship! pic.twitter.com/cKT3zRFDiH\n\nNot only did he deliver the Cleveland Cavaliers their first NBA title, LeBron James also helped the team recover from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors to secure his third NBA championship.\n\nEn route to winning his third NBA Finals MVP during the Cavs' incredible comeback, James had an amazing game six - scoring 41 points and 11 assists - at home that helped his team tie the series. He also had four steals and three blocks in that game.\n\nIt was undoubtedly the brilliance of LeBron James that helped the Cavaliers recover from a deficit to force a seventh game in a memorable NBA Finals series.\n\n#1 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 7 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 29 points | 11 assists | 11 rebounds | 3 blocks | 9/24 FG | 47 minutes\n\nIn game seven of the extraordinary 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron James put up a performance for the ages.\n\nLeBron James is the unanimous 2016 NBA Finals MVP. pic.twitter.com/L4XDDXYlaT\n\nHe guided Cleveland to their first NBA championship with a game-seven Triple-Double (only the second ever in NBA Finals history) while also making key defensive plays that helped the franchise create history.\n\nLeBron James' memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala with the game tied at 89 was huge in the context of the series. Moreover, James led all scorers in the fourth quarter with 11 points (GSW scored 13 in the deciding quarter).\n\nCleveland won the series; James earned Finals MVP recognition, leading the series in every major stat category..\n\nThis performance was easily the greatest individual performance in the NBA Finals in the 21st century.\n\nAlso read: NBA Free Agency 2020: Advantage Golden State Warriors as rivals cry foul over reduced luxury tax.\n\nVictor R.

        "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"
