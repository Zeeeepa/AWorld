          "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

LeBron James is clearly still the best player in the world, and the only thing he has yet to prove is to exceed the Michael Jordan comparison. While LeBron James is a completely different player to MJ and plays a different position, the debate will always be there as Jordan is considered the greatest player of all time and the standard for all great players.\nOne topic of comparison is always the competition both legends faced and the road they took to winning NBA championships. Jordan has 6 rings compared to LeBron's 4, but LeBron might have had the tougher competition when narrowing down each Finals' appearance. However, Jordan might have faced the best all-around players in his 6 Finals appearances whereas LeBron played better teams. Nonetheless, it is time to capture each player's NBA Finals appearances by assessing the competition.\nMichael Jordan\n\n1991 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Magic Johnson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Vlade Divac (Hall of Famer), James Worthy (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team)\nMJ's first NBA Finals appearance was a positive one, as was the case for all of MJ's NBA rings. Jordan and the Bulls led the charge against legendary point guard Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. In a showdown between the 2 best players in the era, this was an amazing series whereby Jordan stamped his mark on the league. MJ and the Bulls fell in Game 1, before closing out the series in 5. MJ was the key player all series long, with Scottie Pippen adding in a sensational 32-point game in Game 5 to help MJ close it out. The Lakers finished 3rd in the league that season compared to the Bulls finishing first, and the Jordan era officially began in the 1991 Finals.\n1992 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Clyde Drexler (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Buck Williams (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis is known as the series where Michael Jordan took things personally. Clyde Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1st seed in the Western Conference against the 1st seeded Chicago Bulls. Drexler was thought to be at least equal competition to Michael Jordan, which MJ wanted to prove wrong. Drexler held his own with sensational performances in the series, but MJ had too many key moments such as hitting 6 threes in the 1st quarter of Game 1 and then dropping 33 points in a closeout Game 6. Jordan would simply not allow the series to go to 7, as he was ruthless in making it clear Drexler doesn't come close to his greatness.\n1993 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Charles Barkley (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Dan Majerle (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis was probably the toughest opponent for Michael Jordan. Led by league MVP Charles Barkley, the Suns had the best record in the West while Chicago fell to the #2 seed. As great as Barkley and defensive specialist Dan Majerle were, Jordan and the Bulls were just better. The Bulls took the first 2 games of the series before Phoenix won in 3-OT in Game 3. Jordan responded with 55 points in Game 4 before he made the iconic pass to John Paxson for the game-winning three. Barkley was a dominant player in the series but Jordan was near perfection all series long and he once again did not allow for a Game 7.\n1996 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Gary Payton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Shawn Kemp (All-NBA 2nd Team)\nAfter a brief retirement, Michael Jordan returned to the NBA to continue the MJ-era. Jordan wasn't going away anytime soon, and he led the charge against defensive phenom Gary Payton and athletic glass cleaner Shawn Kemp. MJ and the Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season, as they went to battle with the number one seed in the West. The Bulls were up 3-0 in the series before Payton and Kemp fought back to win 2 straight. Jordan struggled from the floor in Game 6 shooting 5-19, but he had enough help from Pippen and Rodman to close out the series and win Finals MVP in yet another Game 6 closeout.\n1997 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team, All-NBA 2nd Defensive Team)\nMJ and the Bulls made their 5th straight NBA Finals appearance against Karl Malone and John Stockton, who led the Jazz to the best record in the Western Conference. The Bulls won the first 2 games before Utah evened it up in 4. In the legendary \"Flu Game\", Jordan dropped 38 points and willed Chicago to victory in one of the most iconic moments. Jordan then had another iconic moment when he found Steve Kerr for the game-winning shot to capture his 5th title and 5th Finals MVP. Stockton and Malone were a great duo and this presented a massive challenge to MJ and the Bulls, so Jordan's unselfishness in Game 6 was one of his greatest moments.\n1998 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer)\nWas there ever any doubt that Jordan would reach the Finals again? He already had one 3-peat with the Bulls and wanted to do it again. The #1 seeded Bulls led the charge against the #1 seeded Utah Jazz led by Hall of Fame duo Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone and Stockton had taken Game 1 before Chicago answered with 3 straight victories. After Utah stole Game 5, Jordan had one of the most iconic moments in history by stripping Karl Malone on one end and hit the game-winning shot over Bryon Russell to capture his 6th NBA title and 6th Finals MVP.\nLeBron James\n\n2007 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Bruce Bowen (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron's first Finals appearance did not go as he planned, mainly because he was outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Spurs were simply a better team than the Cavaliers as they had 3 Hall of Famers playing under a Hall of Fame coach. Bruce Bowen also made an All-NBA Defensive Team which made life particularly difficult for LeBron in this series. This was a tough series for LeBron as the Cavs were swept, and LeBron does get a pass for most people on this one.\n2011 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Dirk Nowitzki (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Jason Kidd (Hall of Famer), Tyson Chandler (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron's 2nd Finals' appearance also did not go as planned. He had a Superteam with the Miami Heat with the likes of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh by his side, and they were the heavy favorites coming into the series. In possibly the most shocking way, LeBron played much below his usual level and the Heat were beaten in 6 games by the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki was the best player during the playoffs and LeBron James was nowhere near as great. This is a big black mark on LeBron's legendary career for sure.\n2012 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Russell Westbrook (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), James Harden (Hall of Famer), Serge Ibaka (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron James made amends for his prior Finals appearance disaster by leading the Heat Superteam against the Oklahoma City Thunder who had their own younger Superteam. Led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder had athleticism and youth on their side along with an exceptional 6th man in James Harden and an All-NBA Defensive Team player in Serge Ibaka. The Heat were simply too good with their Big Three, and LeBron James finally played like the best player in the series to win his first NBA title.\n2013 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer)\nLeBron's 2nd NBA title came against the San Antonio Spurs, who should have beaten LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Known as the series where Ray Allen made the most clutch shot in NBA history, the Heat fought back and won the series despite being down 3-2. LeBron James was once again the best player in the series, and he willed his team to victory in this series against 4 Hall of Fame Spurs players. Head coach Gregg Popovich forced LeBron to beat them with jumpers, and he did that on his way to winning his 2nd straight Finals MVP.\n2014 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer, All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron James once again was in the Finals with the Miami Heat for the 4th time in a row, this time falling short to the Spurs who exacted their revenge. The Spurs were on a mission this season and the growth of Kawhi Leonard into a star helped San Antonio blow out the Heat in the series. Leonard won Finals MVP, and LeBron could not do enough to counter the Spurs' new Big Four. Dwyane Wade looked older in this series and LeBron James had to settle for another Finals loss in his record.\n2015 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Andrew Bogut (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nOnce again, LeBron James made the Finals this time with his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers. With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love by his side, LeBron James made the Cavs the favorite in the Eastern Conference. Making it all the way to the Finals, they are up against Stephen Curry and the revolutionary Warriors team who introduced the small-ball lineup with Andre Iguodala playing the power forward spot. Unfortunately for LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injures leaving him to fend off the Big Three Warriors by himself. He had a sensational series, but the Warriors had too much with Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP over LeBron James and sending him home with a loss.\n2016 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nThe greatest achievement in LeBron's career came in the 2016 NBA Finals, whereby he played the Warriors against this time with a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Cavs were down 3-1 in the series, and it looked like LeBron would have to suffer yet another loss in the Finals. But he took his game to another level, and alongside Kyrie Irving, were too dominant for the Warriors as they won the NBA title in a historic comeback. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the series, although Kyrie Irving hit the biggest shot of the game in Game 7 to win the series.\n2017 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs once again made the NBA Finals to play the Warriors, except Golden State added superstar player Kevin Durant to join their Big Three of Curry, Thompson, and Green. LeBron still had Irving and Love, but the Warriors were just unstoppable with Kevin Durant as they beat down the Cavs convincingly. LeBron held his own and would have been Finals MVP in the victory, but Durant and the Warriors were too dominant on both ends as KD won Finals MVP and added the 5th Finals loss to LeBron's record.\n2018 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs made the NBA Finals yet again, this time without Kyrie Irving who was traded to Boston. It is a shame LeBron did not have his little brother Irving by his side because their duo was truly exciting to watch. Without Irving, LeBron had to lead average players to battle against the Golden State Warriors juggernaut led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. In one of the most embarrassing Finals moments in history, J.R. Smith dribbled out the clock instead of helping the Cavs snatch Game 1. LeBron put forth a Goliath 50-point performance that went to waste, effectively ending the series the Cavs lost 4-0.\n2020 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Jimmy Butler (All-NBA 3rd Team), Bam Adebayo (All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nWith LeBron's 3rd NBA team, he won his 4th NBA title. While certainly not the toughest opponent that LeBron faced and the easiest challenge in both MJ's and LeBron's competition, James and the Lakers beat the Heat in 6 games. LeBron James had Anthony Davis by his side, while Jimmy Butler was left to fend for himself as both Bam Adebayo and starting point guard Goran Dragic were out with injuries. Butler held his own with iconic performances, but LeBron and Davis were the best duo in the NBA and the Lakers were too good for any team in the league. While LeBron's easiest challenge, the Heat were no pushovers as LeBron James had to play at an MVP level to win his 4th Finals MVP.\nNext\nRanking The 10 Greatest Teammates That Michael Jordan Has Ever Had In His Career\n2020 NBA Free Agency: Ranking Top 15 Best Players Who Could Be Available\nRanking The 10 Greatest NBA Players Of The 90s\nRanking LeBron James’ 10 Best Teams In The NBA Finals\nLos Angeles Lakers Have 6 Of Top 10 Greatest Players Of All-Time\n\nBy\nEddie Bitar\nEddie Bitar is a senior staff writer at Fadeaway World, renowned for his insightful blend of sports journalism with economic and financial expertise.

The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nWinners\n\n^ |

Throughout his illustrious career he has seen both highs and lows, whilst providing the basketball community with unforgettable performances for the ages. Therefore, I have tasked myself with the impossible mission of ranking, specifically, his top 5 playoff performances.\n\nTo rank a player’s performance in the NBA, let alone, LeBron James, is no small task. Therefore, to assist in being able to categorise and create an objective ranking, a set of criteria will be utilised to meet the aim of creating an accurate ranking.\n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n\nEach facet will be measured out of a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best and 0 the worst. The total will be ranked and measured out of a scale of 50.\n\n5. 2020 Finals Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 44/50\n\nIn a closeout game with the Lakers looking to finish off the Miami Heat and lay claim to the 2020 NBA title, LeBron James was determined as ever to get another championship on his third team. The King poured in 40 points on an unbelievable 71.4 FG%, on top of this, he managed to pull down 13 rebounds and dished out 7 assists.\n\nPlaying out of his traditional Small Forward position that he has played throughout the majority of his career, and instead at the helm of the Lakers offense as the teams point guard. The high usage, touches and ultimately responsibility further emphasis how impressive of a performance he delivered in game 5, particularly, in respect to his overall efficiency.\n\nIn the end, Game 5 came down to the wire as the infamous playoff riser, Jimmy Butler, served the Lakers an ice cold 35-point triple double. The Heats defence, a Danny Green missed shot (wide open), coupled with Jimmy’s heroics put the Lakers away in the do-or-die game for the Heat. Thus, like many of LeBron’s iconic performances, the team could not match his level of effort to pull out the win.\n\n4. 2007 ECF Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 46/50\n\nAt just 22 years old, willing a poorly constructed Cavaliers roster to heights beyond anyones expectations. This performance could be considered the genesis of the legend of LeBron, where he looked like a kid playing at the local park, a video game character, mythical, to say the least.\n\nJames’ performance against the rough and tough Detroit Pistons is defined by the staple closing period of the game, where James went unconscious by putting 25 straight points on the board to edge the Cavs over the Pistons, this would position the Cavs 3-2, in an eventual series win, proving to be the pivotal moment, not only in the game but the series.\n\nThe momentum changing game would provide the Cleveland Cavaliers with a franchise first NBA Finals appearance. A historical achievement, that in hindsight, adds further weight and significance to the feats LeBron reached during game 5.\n\nIt’s not common that young superstars display such dominance, maturity and responsibility in their game, but LeBron James was able to do just that in his showing during Game 5. A performance that has yet to be toppled by the rising stars of the NBA since.\n\n3. 2012 ECF Game 6\n\nPerformance score: 47/50\n\nAt the time of Game 6, LeBron was down a 3-2 deficit to the dynastic Boston Celtics of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This series was on the back of the disaster showing in the previous seasons final, where the Heat fell to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt was a legacy game, a turning point in LeBron’s career. If they lost, would the Heat have to rethink things over and blow it up? Is LeBron capable of leading a team to the mountain top? All these questions and much more loomed over the team like a dark cloud.\n\n\n\nUnrelenting, and defiant in preserving the Miami Heat, who were on a lifeline at this point in the series. LeBron, as seen in the thumbnail image above, had a look in his eye, only comparable to a lion stalking its prey. He attacked the Boston Celtics with brute force, finesse fadeaways from the mid-post and athletic finishes around the rim.\n\nHe silenced the Celtics superteam and the raging home crowd with 45-points on 73.1% shooting, along with 15 rebounds and 5 assists. A performance that turned down the volume on the critics within the media and NBA fanbase, and proved that nothing was going to deter LeBron from getting his first ring.\n\nThis infamous game lives on as one of the most iconic games of his career, and arguably one of the greatest performances of all time.\n\n2. 2016 Finals Game 7\n\nPerformance score: 49.5/50\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the greatest NBA game of all time, the historic series comeback by the Cavaliers, scratching and clawing their way back into the series after being knocked down 3-1, against the greatest regular season team of all time.\n\nThe unquantifiable pressure emanating from Oracle Arena on June 19, 2016 could be felt through television screens halfway around the world. The stakes couldn’t get any higher, it was up to the stars to prove to the world whether they could step into the limelight. An underlying narrative was that LeBron had promised to raise a banner for the city of Cleveland, in his return from his Miami Heat stint. More pressure than ever was on Jame to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he did. The King produced an all around masterclass, a 27 point triple-double. Additionally, an amazing stat to put into perspective just how important James was during the crucial game is that he contributed to 50% of the Cavaliers points directly, either by assist or scoring (27 points, 19 points created from assists). The unreal offensive control was complemented by stellar defense, which birthed the iconic and arguably greatest highlight of LeBron’s career “The Block”.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to not place this as the greatest game of his career due to the unreal performance on both sides of the floor, the stakes and ultimately, the outcome of the iconic game.\n\n1. 2018 Finals Game 1\n\nPerformance score: 50/50\n\nIn a series that perfectly emulates the biblical story of David versus Goliath, LeBron James established a new precedent with his Game 1 performance. Before the series began, many within the media and broader NBA community assumed that the Golden State Warriors would trample over the one man army Cavaliers in dominant and blown-out fashion. Despite the series ending in a sweep, it was held much closer than pundits anticipated, largely due to James’ historic play.\n\nIn Game 1, LeBron showed utter offensive domination, with balanced inside-out scoring throughout the competition. He finished the game with a jaw-dropping 51 points (playoff career high), to go along with a near triple double of 8 rebounds and 8 assists. On top of this, he shot 43% from the 3-point range and 59% as a whole from the field. It was the cherry on top of the cake in terms of performances during his historical 2018 playoff season run.\n\nTherefore, this performance ranks as his best in my opinion, and the greatest NBA Finals performance of all time because:\n\nShare this:\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n"

          "raw_content": "Top 10 LeBron James' NBA Playoff games\n\nLeBron James is easily a top-3 player in the history of the NBA Playoffs, which makes ranking his 10 greatest games an arduous task for anyone. The King has dominated the NBA in recent times, unlike any other player.\n\nEarly in his career, it was all about his athleticism and carefree abandon that came with youth. With experience, he became a more lethal player, as he used a combination of his world-class athleticism and analytical mind to outhink and outmanoevre opponents.\n\nOn that note, let us have a look at 10 such games in the NBA Playoffs, where LeBron James produced his most memorable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeBron James' ten greatest games in the NBA Playoffs\n\nLeBron James is the undisputed greatest active player in the NBA and arguably one of the greatest of all time. Unsurprisingly, he has often reserved his best for the business end of the competition - the NBA Playoffs.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe King, as LeBron James is often known as, is an all-time great NBA playoff performer and also the all-time leader in games played (282). From such a significant sample size, it is indeed a challenging proposition to handpick a few games as he has had memorable performances galore.\n\nNevertheless, let us have a look at LeBron James' 10 best performances in the NBA Playoffs. Without further ado, let's get started.\n\n#10 LeBron James vs OKC Thunder - Game 4 (2012 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 26 points | 12 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 10/20 FG | 44 minutes\n\nDespite his unquestionable talent and pedigree, LeBron James was surprisingly ringless when he arrived in the 2012 NBA Playoffs against OKC Thunder. But that would change by the end of that finals series.\n\nThe 2012 NBA #Finals MVP - LeBron James!  http://t.co/SlHygrml\n\nIn the fourth game of that series against the Thunder, the Miami Heat were up 2-1 but needed to increase their lead in Miami before going back to OKC for the final two games of the series.\n\nA win by OKC in Miami would have meant that the series would have been decided in the former's home, but LeBron James managed to ensure that that did not happen. OKC's best chance to win a game in Miami was in that fourth game of the series, but LeBron James, despite struggling with physical issues in the fourth quarter, had other ideas.\n\nAfter getting afflicted by cramps in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter, LeBron James returned to the court and hit his only three-point shot of the night when the scores were tied at 94-all.\n\nIt was a shot in the arm for the Miami Heat, who went on to close the game with a 12-4 run to take a 3-1 lead in the series. In the next game of the series, Miami blew OKC off the floor, as LeBron James won his first NBA title and was also named the Finals MVP.\n\n#9 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 7 (2018 ECF)\n\nStats: 35 points | 9 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 blocks | 12/24 FG | 48 minutes\n\nIn his last season to date playing for an Eastern Conference team, LeBron James dominated the 2018 Eastern Conference Playoffs despite not having a great supporting cast around him (at least while facing a Western Conference team in the finals).\n\n33.9 PPG8.9 RPG8.8 APGLeBron James came to play in the 2018 #NBAPlayoffs! 🏀: #WhateverItTakes x #CUsRise GAME 7 ⏰: 8:30pm/et 📺:@ESPNNBA pic.twitter.com/YdZeo4W0Lb\n\nIn the deciding game of that year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James had a memorable night in front of a Boston crowd who witnessed The King's prowess first hand.\n\nLeBron James played every minute of the Cleveland Cavaliers' 87-79 victory on the road against the Celtics. Despite a high number of turnovers (eight), James had an incredible night.\n\nWith Boston up by one point entering the fourth quarter, LeBron James scored 12 in the deciding period on 4/6 from the field and dished out four assists to reach his ninth NBA Finals, his eighth on the trot.\n\n#8 LeBron James vs Indiana Pacers - Second Round - Game 4 (2012 NBA Playoffs)\n\nStats: 40 points | 9 assists | 18 rebounds | 2 steals | 2 blocks | 14/27 FG | 44 minutes\n\nLeBron James' run to his first NBA championship in the 2012 NBA Playoffs was characterised by pressure, which the player experienced every game.\n\nA Decade of Dominance!@KingJames & Miami climb to the top in 2012 & 2013 (via @SekouSmithNBA): https://t.co/8RYwcSaMZX pic.twitter.com/z6hw8fIsWh\n\nIn the second round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, LeBron James and the Heat were down 2-1 against the Indiana Pacers after losing two games in a row and scoring only 75 points in each match.\n\nIn game four at Indiana, the pressure was at a crescendo because the team had failed the year before and was close to faltering in the NBA Playoffs again.\n\nNevertheless, LeBron James destroyed the Pacers with his first 40-point game in the NBA Playoffs for the Heat. That tied the series at two-all. There was more pressure against the Boston Celtics in the Conference semi-finals before LeBron James and the Miami Heat managed to go all the way.\n\n#7 LeBron James vs Miami Heat - Game 6 (2020 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 28 points | 10 assists | 14 rebounds | 1 turnover | 13/20 FG | 41 minutes\n\nIn his most recent game in his NBA Playoffs career - Game 6 of the 2020 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat - LeBron James reinforced his claim for a place among the NBA's all-time greats.\n\nThe 2020 Bill Russell #NBAFinals MVP... LeBron James of the @Lakers! #LakeShow pic.twitter.com/jyAko4pjbN\n\nLeBron James led the LA Lakers' to a 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat to help secure the franchise's record-equalling 17th NBA title. In the process, James won his fourth ring to go with his fourth Finals MVP award which he won with a third different team (the only player to ever do so).\n\nJames rose to the fore when he was required the most to seal the title for the Lakers in a difficult year for the city and the franchise.\n\nThe player capped his tenth NBA Finals by averaging 30 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists on 59% shooting from the field and 42% from the three. Arguably, that was James' greatest ever performance, in terms of stats, in an NBA Finals/NBA Playoffs series.\n\n#6 LeBron James vs Detroit Pistons - Game 5 (2007 ECF)\n\nStats: 48 points | 7 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 50 minutes\n\nThis was LeBron James' greatest game in his career in the NBA Playoffs for many, which came against the Detroit Pistons in game five of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIf anyone needed further proof of LeBron James' arrival among the NBA's elite in history, they need not look further than this game. LeBron James is called 'The King' for several reasons, one of them being his performances in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nAgainst one of the greatest defensive teams of the modern era, James put up an amazing performance to get a double-overtime win for the Cavs, who took a 3-2 lead before wrapping up the series at home in game six.\n\nLeBron James scored the last 25 points for Cleveland in his first-ever appearance in an ECF against a team that was playing their fourth consecutive ECF and had won the NBA title in 2004 and reached the NBA Finals in 2005.\n\n#5 LeBron James vs Denver Nuggets - Game 5 (2020 WCF)\n\nStats: 38 points | 10 assists | 16 rebounds | 15/25 FG | 40 minutes\n\nWith the LA Lakers up 3-1 in the 2020 Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, the talk in the series was about Denver, as they had returned from 3-1 deficits in the previous two rounds of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nHowever, it was obvious that LeBron James would put an end to that narrative because those things have never happened to him in the NBA Playoffs. Lack of a killer instinct in the NBA Playoffs? No, James is simply different.\n\nIn game five, the Nuggets were hanging well with the Lakers, as they did in most games in that series (James was not having his greatest series at that point).\n\nLeBron James then took the game by the scruff of its neck in the fourth quarter, scoring 16 points on 7/10 shooting from the field to close the series and advance to his tenth NBA Finals, his ninth in the last ten years.\n\n#4 LeBron James vs San Antonio Spurs - Game 7 (2013 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 37 points | 4 assists | 12 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 5/10 3P | 45 minutes\n\nIn his first-ever game seven in an NBA Finals, LeBron James handled the pressure well to win back-to-back titles (after winning an epic game six). In this game, James proved that his perimeter shooting was good enough on the biggest of stages.\n\nIn the entire series, the Spurs gave up mid-range and three-point shots to LeBron James as a defensive tactic, trying to reduce James' impact when he entered the paint to find open shots for his teammates.\n\nThe ploy worked to an extent, as the San Antonio Spurs took a 3-2 lead and were certainly in a position to close the Heat out in game six before Ray Allen's all-time iconic shot tied the game, and Miami eventually took an OT win.\n\nJames made five of his ten attempts from the three in the deciding game after making only seven of 24 in the first six. His three-point range and a mid-range jump shot, with the Heat up by two points with 28 seconds remaining, sealed the game in Miami's favor.\n\nLeBron James also scored nine points in the fourth quarter to give the Heat back-to-back NBA championships. He earned his second Finals MVP too to close out a tremendous 2013 NBA Playoffs run.\n\n#3 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 6 (2012 ECF)\n\nStats: 45 points | 5 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/26 FG | 45 minutes\n\nIn easily his most efficient and impactful game of his NBA Playoffs career, LeBron James dominated the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden with one of the NBA's best individual performances ever seen.\n\nThis was a ring-less LeBron James facing a team that had won the NBA championship in 2008 and played in the Finals in 2010, both times eliminating James' team in the NBA Playoffs along the way.\n\nThis time, James' team was certainly the more favored, one but Boston won three straight games to take a 3-2 lead. With home court advantage in game six, it was looking good for the Doc Rivers-coached team.\n\nHowever, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen had to experience one of their toughest losses during their tenure together in the NBA Playoffs. James scored 30 points (12/14 FG) in the first half to put the Heat up 55-42 after 24 minutes.\n\nHe then made timely shots in the second half to break Boston's heart before shutting down their comeback attempts with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists on 73% shooting. In game seven, the Heat overwhelmed Boston again to reach the 2012 NBA Finals, where LeBron James won his first NBA title.\n\n#2 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 6 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 41 points | 11 assists | 8 rebounds | 4 steals | 16/27 FG | 42 minutes\n\nThe 2016 NBA Finals was LeBron James' greatest series in his legendary NBA Playoffs career.\n\n#2 | TOP 20 CLUTCH PLAYS - 2010s🚫 \"OH, BLOCKED BY JAMES!\" 🚫@KingJames comes out of nowhere for the INCREDIBLE CHASEDOWN BLOCK in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA FINALS, sending the @cavs to their first-ever NBA championship! pic.twitter.com/cKT3zRFDiH\n\nNot only did he deliver the Cleveland Cavaliers their first NBA title, LeBron James also helped the team recover from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors to secure his third NBA championship.\n\nEn route to winning his third NBA Finals MVP during the Cavs' incredible comeback, James had an amazing game six - scoring 41 points and 11 assists - at home that helped his team tie the series. He also had four steals and three blocks in that game.\n\nIt was undoubtedly the brilliance of LeBron James that helped the Cavaliers recover from a deficit to force a seventh game in a memorable NBA Finals series.\n\n#1 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 7 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 29 points | 11 assists | 11 rebounds | 3 blocks | 9/24 FG | 47 minutes\n\nIn game seven of the extraordinary 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron James put up a performance for the ages.\n\nLeBron James is the unanimous 2016 NBA Finals MVP. pic.twitter.com/L4XDDXYlaT\n\nHe guided Cleveland to their first NBA championship with a game-seven Triple-Double (only the second ever in NBA Finals history) while also making key defensive plays that helped the franchise create history.\n\nLeBron James' memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala with the game tied at 89 was huge in the context of the series. Moreover, James led all scorers in the fourth quarter with 11 points (GSW scored 13 in the deciding quarter).\n\nCleveland won the series; James earned Finals MVP recognition, leading the series in every major stat category..\n\nThis performance was easily the greatest individual performance in the NBA Finals in the 21st century.\n\nAlso read: NBA Free Agency 2020: Advantage Golden State Warriors as rivals cry foul over reduced luxury tax.\n\nVictor R.

          "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"

One of the defining tests of NBA superstardom is a player’s ability to positively influence his teammates’ play. Stars can improve a teammate’s play through not only their own play, but also their presence; the greatest players of all-time carry an aura with them that embodies winning.\nFour-time NBA champion and Finals MVP LeBron James has illustrated this aura throughout the entirety of his 17-year career. James has the power to thrust his teammates into an unfamiliar position — directly in the spotlight.\nIf these players deliver when they are called upon, their legacies are cemented next to role players like Steve Kerr, whose famous 1997 Finals-winning shot lives on eternally in the Role Player Hall of Fame. Failure to deliver, however, means a player will be exposed to a level of scrutiny unlike ever before. This phenomenon experienced by James’ teammates can be known as the “LeBron Effect.”\n\nNelson Chenault-USA TODAY Sports\nJames’ impact on his teammates is so profound that his influence was felt not just by younger players, but also by accomplished veterans like Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo over last season.\nHere is a look at how James impacted the play of his teammates last season.\n\nHoward, Rondo experience veteran resurgence\nBefore their tenures with the Lakers, it seemed both Howard and Rondo were more destined for stardom in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league than a return to their NBA glory. And while a lack of talent was hardly the issue for either of the former All-NBA selections, accountability was.\nAfter stops in five different cities over the past five seasons, Dwight Howard arrived in Los Angeles on a last-chance deal. Playing alongside James sparked a newfound commitment to winning in Howard. For the first time in his career, he embraced his ideal role as a rim-protecting screen setter.\nEven when Howard was scoring over 20 points a night, he was never a great low post scorer, as most of his offense depended on his otherworldly athleticism. Despite this, Howard adamantly maintained his status among the league leaders in post-ups year after year. During the 2017-18 season (Howard’s last full season before this year), he ranked third in the NBA with 331 field goal attempts off post-ups. Low post scoring requires a soft-touch and grace that has eluded Howard his entire career.\nJames and the Lakers unlocked the optimal version of Howard. Instead of stagnating their offense by throwing the ball into a stationary Howard on the low block, Los Angeles leveraged his athleticism and screen-setting ability. In 69 games this season, Howard only attempted 23 shots out of post-ups.\nWhile Howard deserves credit for making the long-overdue adjustments to his game, it’s impossible to imagine him embracing a limited role off the bench that didn’t come at the James’ behest.\nFor as good as Howard was, Rondo’s resurgence was far more vital to the Lakers’ championship run. James’ greatest impact on Rondo came in the form of trust.\nOne of the hardest parts for any great NBA player is determining what responsibilities they can delegate over the course of 48 minutes. For a player with James’ playmaking prowess, conceding touches in the postseason and allowing a teammate to initiate the offense can be risky. But having an unflappable veteran point guard capable of taking the reins of the offense goes a long way in easing that feeling.\nRondo averaged 6.6 assists per game in the playoffs and served as the guiding hand for the Lakers’ bench units. In Los Angeles’ Game 4 win in the NBA Finals, Rondo orchestrated the pick and roll that ultimately set up Anthony Davis for the game-sealing three with under a minute remaining. Rondo is unafraid of any moment, and following the Lakers’ defeat in Game 5, he took the onus upon himself to put the Miami Heat away in Game 6.\nRondo began the game shooting 5-for-5 as part of a 19-point effort in the series’ closeout game. Aggressive drives in semi-transition opportunities like the one above depict how he sliced through Miami’s defense. As the postseason continued, Rondo looked more comfortable in not only attacking the basket, but also shooting.\nFor the playoffs, Rondo shot 40 percent (20-of-50) from three, a vast improvement for the career 31.6 percent long-range shooter. Although it seems highly unlikely that Rondo’s success from deep will translate over the course of an entire season, the threat of a jump shot alone made Rondo far more dangerous in the pick and roll. Even in the games that he did not shoot well, Rondo remained engaged and did the little things crucial for winning.\n\nEstablishing a name\nWhile James helped redefine the narratives surrounding some of the Lakers veterans’ careers, he also helped shape those of the younger Lakers. Alex Caruso went from a beloved meme on NBA Twitter to an invaluable piece capable of locking down opposing perimeter players and hitting timely shots.\nIn the 560 regular minutes that James and Caruso shared the floor, Los Angeles outscored their opponents by a staggering 18.6 points per 100 possessions. It did not matter who else occupied the other three spots on the floor, as James and Caruso’s presence in a lineup alone ensured the Lakers’ success.\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. While no one has perfected the chase down quite like James, Caruso’s rejection of James Harden on the play below was a visual embodiment of the effort Caruso plays with nightly. Unparalleled energy and passion paired with James’ unwavering confidence in him turned Caruso into a necessary ingredient in the Lakers championship recipe.\nNo Lakers player felt the negative aspects of the LeBron Effect more than Danny Green. In Game 5, James presented Green with his Steve Kerr opportunity, but history had other plans.\nOne missed shot does not define a legacy, but one made shot can. Even though the Lakers still went on to win the series and Green is now a three-time NBA champion, he will likely never get a chance at basketball immortality again. But even for as painful as the miss was, Markieff Morris’ turnover on the play was far more egregious, as James was standing wide open on the wing when Morris heaved the lob pass out of bounds.\nWhile James’ latest Finals victory has breathed new life into the G.O.A.T debate, do not expect his approach to falter. As the King continues chasing the legacy of a ghost in Chicago, he must continue to expect the same greatness he requires of himself from his teammates.\nRead Comments\n\nFind Your Next Springtime Adventure in OregonSpring trails, rushing rivers, and blooming valleys—see it all with a guide.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)\nUndo\nA perfect pour on Oregon’s Food TrailsExperience Oregon’s Food Trails to find award-winning wineries, small-batch breweries and orchard-fresh cider.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)\nUndo\nA Party-Ready PatioThe Spruce| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:) Learn More\nUndo\nExperts Agree—This Little Orange Shot Could Be The Answer To Your Slow DigestionDose| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:) Shop Now\nUndo\nTop 10 worst cities to drive inEvery city has roads we wish were less traveled.

However, for LeBron, the meaning of success has shifted toward something more profound: inspiring others.“I think it comes down to, like, what does success mean to me now? It’s about inspiring the guys that's with you and the crew that's coming after you,” James said.“Hoping that what you're doing and the tools and the DNA and the blueprint that you're doing while you're still playing and striving while you're doing that, it is going to trickle down to the generation that you're with and the generation that's coming in.”James acknowledges that success is not just about personal achievement but also about paving the way for those who follow. He wants his legacy to extend beyond the hardwood, influencing future athletes in various aspects of life and sport.One of the core philosophies LeBron follows is the idea of leaving the game in a better place than when he entered it. He believes that every generation of players should contribute to the evolution of the sport, ensuring that younger athletes have a strong foundation to build upon.LeBron  JamesMIN:35.06PTS:24.41(56.3%)REB:8.13As:8.39ST:0.98BL:0.59TO:3.81GM:64ProfileNBA2024/2025“We've always heard the saying, like, leave the game in a better place than when you were in it. And that's what success for me is. I hope I can inspire the next generation of great players, great athletes, not only in just basketball, but in sport in general,” James explained.A crucial part of James’ message is the importance of longevity and self-care. As one of the most durable athletes in sports history, LeBron has placed a significant emphasis on maintaining both his physical and mental well-being.“What it means to take care of your body and, you know, keeping your mind fresh and understanding, like, being more driven by the process more than the actual ending goal,” James said.Rather than being solely focused on results, James believes true success lies in the journey—the commitment to self-improvement, discipline, and perseverance. His career is a testament to this mindset, as he continues to perform at an elite level deep into his NBA tenure.Beyond the court, James has built a brand and legacy that extend far beyond his athletic achievements. From philanthropy to business ventures, he has continually demonstrated the importance of creating opportunities that last beyond a playing career.“I hope that I can leave a blueprint for how to take care of your body, how to be a great athlete, and how to be a great teammate, how to build your brand, and how to build your legacy off the court as well,” James said.“It’s bigger than just the game, it’s bigger than just the sport, it’s about living a life that makes people proud, makes your family proud, makes the people that came before you proud.”Full podcast:Thank you for being with us!

          "raw_content": "How LeBron James changed NBA this decade\n\nFrom the minute LeBron James decided in 2010 to play for the Heat, it was inevitable that nobody would have a bigger impact on the NBA in the following 10 years.\n\nJames, now playing for the Lakers, won championships, MVPs, a gold medal, dominated the Eastern Conference and became a fixture in the NBA Finals in the decade.\n\nHe empowered players, spoke out on basketball and non-basketball issues, created avenues to expand his brand and business in Hollywood and turned his charitable work into meaningful projects that will continue to have an impact long after James is finished playing basketball.\n\nFor all of this and more, James has been voted the athlete of the decade by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHere are five of the ways in which James changed the NBA in the 2010s:\n\nFinals and titles\n\nJames played in eight consecutive Finals, joining a handful of Celtics from the 1950s and 1960s as the only players to accomplish that feat. He won three titles (2012, 2013 and 2016) and delivered memorable performances: a triple-double in a Game 7 victory over Golden State in which the Cavs came back from a 3-1 series deficit, an overtime triple-double in Game 6 against San Antonio to save the Heat from elimination and a 37-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 against the Spurs to clinch a title. He won three Finals MVPs, two regular-season MVPs, a gold medal in 2012 and prevented several teams – Chicago, Indiana, Boston, Atlanta and Toronto – from reaching the Finals. All five of those teams changed coaches after failing to beat James in the playoffs. When he want to Los Angeles, the East exhaled.\n\nBig 3/player empowerment movement\n\nJames pioneered modern-day player empowerment, starting with his decision to form a Big 3 in Miami with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Players play with whom they want and where they want even if that means forcing their way via trade. At the time, James’ move was criticized, but it’s commonplace now and other teams view it as a way to build a championship contender. When James went back to Cleveland in 2014, he joined Kyrie Irving, and the Cavaliers traded for Kevin Love. It happened more organically with Golden State’s Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, but the Warriors still added Kevin Durant in 2016. Last summer, Kawhi Leonard teamed up with Paul George with the Clippers, a move Leonard wouldn’t have made had George not been traded to the Clippers, and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant decided to join up with Brooklyn.\n\nMastery of media\n\nJames hasn’t always been perfect – his much-maligned “The Decision” announcement on ESPN in 2010 being his biggest gaffe. But since then, James has mastered the media landscape, knowing how to use social media, traditional media and his own platform “Uninterrupted” to spread his message. His entertainment company, SpringHill Entertainment, has worked with TV and movie studios to create shows, including \"The Shop\" on HBO and \"Space Jam 2\" with Warner Bros. Today, almost every NBA star uses a form of alternative media (YouTube, Instagram, The Players Tribune) to deliver content to consumers or join large companies on multimedia projects. Durant is an executive producer on ESPN’s \"The Boardroom,\" has a YouTube channel and interacts on Twitter. Curry is developing comedies for TV and the big screen.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nAthletes have been involved in philanthropy long before James, but he took it to another level with his LeBron James Family Foundation. Starting out as a charitable organization that provided free bikes to students who accomplished educational goals, the foundation has grown into something larger than James could’ve even imagined a decade ago. His first major initiative was creating a program in which students who met academic standards would receive free tuition to the University of Akron. His biggest achievement is the I Promise School, a public elementary school for at-risk students in Akron. It opened in 2018 and will continue to grow until it houses grades 3-8 by 2022. James needed basketball to make this happen, but this is much more significant than the game.\n\nSocial and political issues\n\nThe NBA has a history of addressing social issues, dating to the civil rights movement. But there was a bit of a lull in player activism through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. But then Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 in Florida, and James and his Heat teammates wore hoodies for a photo with James tweeting the #WeAreTrayvonMartin hashtag. It marked the beginning of a new era of social and political activism for the NBA. Derrick Rose wore an “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt during pregame warm-ups in support of Eric Garner, an unarmed man who died after an incident with New York police. James also wore one of those shirts and has criticized President Donald Trump on several occasions. With his voice so prominent, his missteps are amplified such as his comments that came off as pro-China just before the start of this season. Even with that, James’ willingness to speak out has helped other athletes do the same.\n\n"

          "raw_content": "ByGlenn Llopis\n\n\n\n4 Transformational Things LeBron James Teaches Us About Leadership And Teamwork\n\nByGlenn Llopis,\n\nContributor.\n\nLeBron James\n\nYou cannot go at leadership alone.  Great teams prevail when they grow and evolve together.\n\nIt’s hard to understand what this really means, until you are put in a position to deliver upon what this entails. For basketball fans, the recent narrative has been that the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the 2018 NBA Finals because LeBron James willed his supreme talents through a supporting cast of mediocrity. But if you know a thing or two about leadership, this is not what has happened.  LeBron James actually willed his leadership through a group of different, yet like-minded teammates that equally wanted to will their ways toward winning a championship.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned their right to the 2018 NBA Finals through the following 4 transformational things LeBron James has taught us all about leadership and teamwork:\n\n1. Spacing and Alignment\n\nWe often refer to spacing on the basketball court as the space that is required to run certain offensive and defensive plays by ensuring that your teammates are in the right spots to successfully execute upon those plays.  This concept of spacing is crucial to leadership success and the effectiveness of high-performance teams – as is requires leaders to give their employees the space to cultivate their ideas and share their ideals with and through others.  Spacing enables leaders and teams to explore endless possibilities centered on their own individual strengths and capabilities.  Spacing is about creating an environment that allows people the room to live with an entrepreneurial spirit – one that focuses on investing in relationships and trusting the value of those relationships that have been intimately cultivated to connect the dots of potential that don’t yet exist into previously unseen opportunities of momentum.\n\nLeBron James is a master at connecting the dots that don’t yet exist. He intimately understands how all of the pieces (teammates) of the puzzle (required solution) work together – with the wisdom to know that the puzzle can change at any time, while the pieces remain the same.  This is the power of creating optimal alignment between leaders and their teams – enabled by the right amount of spacing.\n\n2. Self-Trust and Situational Awareness\n\nThroughout the playoffs, another narrative that has played out is LeBron’s photographic memory, because of his ability to replay in his mind and flawlessly articulate to the media a sequence of plays or happenings that had taken place throughout a game that led to the team’s success or failures.\n\nGreat leaders are constantly replaying in their minds the success factors required to strengthen their situational awareness – especially when the stakes are high and adverse circumstances are overwhelmingly apparent.  During times of tremendous change and transformation this is especially important when you consider that not every leader or every teammate is prepared when circumstances force their hand.  As such, you must train your mind to anticipate the unexpected and this demands a level of courageousness that grows over time by having been exposed to difference circumstances and experiences that allows you to strengthen your mental muscle to elevate confidence into self-trust.\n\nThis is how self-trust is born and is cultivated throughout the span of one’s life and career.  Self-trust is the single most powerful force to strengthen one’s situational awareness as a leader, it gives you the clarity and understanding to know your team and teammates capabilities and what you can and cannot expect from them.\n\nIn 2009, I shared the following wisdom that my father shared with me in my book, Earning Serendipity:  “The wise man forfeits his fortune when he does not trust himself.”  Throughout his 15 year NBA career, LeBron has grown wiser and has learned how to trust himself.  It’s not by chance that he has played his best basketball during his later years.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Lebron James' Off-Court Hustles\n\n\n\n3. Patience and Reinvention\n\nSpeaking of being wiser, wisdom teaches us the importance of patience.  In today’s rapid-paced workplace, patience has become lost in the demands for the immediacy of results.  As such, we rarely appreciate the methods that led to earned success.  One of LeBron James’ most understated skills on the court is the ability to be patient.  Having been crowned “King James,” basketball fans and historians alike expect and demand results (championships) from LeBron.  The pressure to deliver upon these expectations can be overwhelming.  LeBron James has done what most players fail to do enough: continuously reinvent his game (much like Tiger Woods did during his prime).\n\nLeBron constantly refers to taking care of his body and his mind.  While most believe that his pure athleticism and size (6 ft., 8 inches; 280 pounds) is his differentiator, it’s actually what he has done to fuel his mind that has defined his real competitive advantage.  My father used to tell me, “When you fuel your mind with meaningful knowledge each day, it will continue to grow stronger.  When you put it to the test, it will grow wiser.”  LeBron James has conditioned his mind to neutralize external pressure and not allow adversity to disrupt his mindset and ability to perform.  His preparation methods off the court has led to his on the court greatness.\n\nIt has become equally important to be mentally and physically prepared to be a great leader.  Patience and reinvention are crucial to your short and long-term leadership success and your ability to allow your team(s) to create significant outcomes.  Never stop refining your methods.\n\n4. Inclusion and Individuality\n\nLeBron James knows who he is.  When you hear him speak about his teammates, he also knows who they intimately are (there capabilities, their circumstances, their personal and professional history, etc.).  LeBron knows that leadership demands that we reacquaint ourselves with our people.  And when there is employee turnover during times of transformation, you need to take ownership to be part of the solution – not the problem.  LeBron has taught us all that building high-performance leaders and teams demand that we focus on inclusion and the power of individuality.   In other words, you don’t have to spend the most money on talent, nor recruit talent with the best experience, to create winning teams.  You just need to focus more intently on knowing the talent you are recruiting, how they can specifically contribute to building a system that utilizes each individual’s assets for the betterment of the team’s overall success and the organization’s healthier whole.  This approach makes everyone’s success more sustainable.\n\nThis is what the Cleveland Cavaliers did in 2018 when they transformed their roster to give their team a chance to compete for a fourth consecutive NBA finals appearance.  Most would have thought that a fourth consecutive return to The Finals would have been impossible.  But it was through the collaboration of its front office executives and LeBron James’ leadership capabilities (on and off the court) – that the Cleveland Cavaliers created a powerful growth strategy through inclusion and individuality.  Regardless of LeBron’s supreme capabilities, his strengths would not have been as apparent on the court – if each individual was not fully activated and deployed as one cohesive unit.\n\nToday’s leaders must embrace the power of individuality and inclusion.  The speed of change and transformation demands it. Enterprise leadership must stop defining the individual.  This only leads us all down a path of playing not to lose – where complacency ensues.  Leadership in the 21st century is about allowing the individual to influence more and giving them the room to be more inclusive (regardless of hierarchy or rank).  This renewed mindset leads us all down a path of playing to win because the individual desires to be significant for the betterment of a healthier whole.\n\nDeploy your own LeBron James style of leadership that embraces inclusion and recognizes the power of individuality because that’s when possibilities for growth and transformation are unlimited.\n\n\n\n"

While LeBron has certainly carved out an all-time great career, a closer examination of statistics, competition, mental toughness, and impact on the game solidifies Jordan’s place as the undisputed GOAT. Here’s why.\n\n1. Dominance in the Finals: Jordan’s Championship Pedigree\n\nThe clearest distinction between Michael Jordan and LeBron James is in their NBA Finals performances. Let’s break down their records:\n\nPlayer | Finals Record | Championships Won | Finals MVPs\nMichael Jordan | 6-0 | 6 | 6\nLeBron James | 4-6 | 4 | 4\nJordan has never lost in the NBA Finals, a perfect 6-0 record, which is unheard of in modern basketball.\n\nLeBron has appeared in 10 Finals but has lost six times, often criticized for struggling in key moments (2011 Finals vs. Mavericks being a prime example).\n\nJordan won Finals MVP every time he played in the Finals, showing that he was the primary driver of Chicago’s championships.\n\nThe ability to close the deal and win championships without a single defeat is a major separator in the GOAT debate.\n\n2. Statistical Breakdown: Scoring, Efficiency, and Defense\n\nLet’s compare Jordan and LeBron across key statistical categories:\n\nPlayer | PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | FG% | FT%\nMichael Jordan | 30.1 | 6.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 0.8 | 49.7 | 83.5\nLeBron James | 27.1 | 7.5 | 7.3 | 1.5 | 0.9 | 50.5 | 73.4\nKey takeaways:\n\nScoring Dominance: Jordan’s 30.1 PPG is the highest career average in NBA history.\n\nEfficiency in Closing Games: Jordan was a superior free-throw shooter (83.5% vs. LeBron’s 73.4%), meaning he was more reliable in crunch time.\n\nDefense: Jordan was an elite perimeter defender, winning Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) in 1988, while LeBron never won this award.\n\nPassing & Rebounding: LeBron edges Jordan in assists and rebounds, but his style of play as a forward necessitates higher numbers here.\n\nOverall, Jordan’s ability to dominate both ends of the court makes him a more complete player.\n\nDid you know that the Jersey Mount is the only Jersey Hanger on the market that can be mounted to any surface type including the ceiling!

Competition Level: Stronger Era for Jordan?\n\nCritics of LeBron often point out that his era has seen a talent dilution due to expansion teams and weaker defensive rules.\n\nJordan played against Hall of Fame big men like Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, and David Robinson. The physicality of 80s and 90s basketball made scoring harder.\n\nLeBron has played in an era of wide-open, three-point heavy basketball where defenders have fewer tools to stop offensive players due to rule changes.\n\nThe Eastern Conference, where LeBron dominated, was significantly weaker compared to Jordan’s time when teams like the Bad Boy Pistons, Knicks, Pacers, and Celtics were all powerhouse defensive squads.\n\n4. GOAT Mentality: Clutch Factor and Competitive Edge\n\nA major argument for Jordan being the GOAT is his killer instinct and competitiveness:\n\nGame-Winners: Jordan made 25 game-winning shots in his career, many coming in the playoffs (e.g., “The Shot” over Craig Ehlo, 1998 Finals dagger vs. Utah).\n\nNo Weak Mental Moments: Jordan never disappeared in crucial moments, whereas LeBron had major letdowns (2011 Finals vs. Dallas, 2014 vs. Spurs).\n\nRelentless Work Ethic: Jordan’s dedication to improvement and his ruthless approach to competition (famously pushing teammates in practice) is unparalleled.\n\nLeBron has had impressive clutch moments, but he has also been criticized for passing up last shots and playing passively in key games.\n\n5. Cultural Impact and Global Influence\n\nJordan transcended basketball in ways LeBron hasn’t:\n\nAir Jordan Brand: The Jordan Brand still dominates global sneaker sales decades after his retirement.\n\nIconic Moments: His presence in pop culture, from Space Jam to the NBA logo speculation, cements his legacy.\n\nOlympic Dream Team: The 1992 Dream Team, led by Jordan, globalized the NBA in ways never seen before.\n\nRespect from Peers: Players from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Durant have modeled their mentality after Jordan, proving his enduring influence.\n\nLeBron’s activism and social impact are commendable, but Jordan’s legacy remains untouchable when it comes to influence on the game.\n\nFinal Verdict: The GOAT Title Belongs to Jordan\n\nWhile LeBron James is undoubtedly one of the greatest players of all time, when analyzed through championship success, statistics, competition, mentality, and impact, Michael Jordan remains the GOAT.\n\n6-0 Finals Record vs. 4-6\n\n30.1 PPG Career Scoring Average\n\nDefensive Dominance (DPOY, steals leader)\n\nUnmatched Clutch Factor\n\nGlobal Icon Beyond Basketball\n\nFor those who watched Jordan dominate in real time, his aura of invincibility, competitive fire, and ability to rise in the biggest moments set him apart from any other player. LeBron may be a more versatile all-around player, but Jordan was simply built differently—a true assassin on the court.\n\nMichael Jordan is, and always will be, the GOAT.\n\nLeBron vs. Stephen A.

While Lebron still has many more chapters to write for his legacy, the Jordan legacy is one of if not the greatest athletic legacy of all time. While these analysts will throw out statistics and try to analytically compare these two icons, Jordan’s legacy goes beyond the basketball court. While this debate will probably never end here are five reasons why Michael Jordan’s legacy is greater than Lebron James will be.\n\n5) College glory\n\nUnlike Lebron, Jordan has a National Championship on his legacy\n\nThis one is a quick and one-sided debate. Since Lebron James never attended college he never had the chance to leave a legacy on college basketball. However, Jordan did. As a freshman, he made the winning shot against Georgetown to win the National Championship in 1982. With Jordan, the Tar Heels helped to build one of the best programs in college basketball which continues today. While Lebron supporters will say that it is more impressive to go from high school to the NBA, Jordan had one of the greatest college basketball careers and has added bonus points to his resume. Only a handful of players have made such an impact in both the NCAA and the NBA, and Jordan is one of them.\n\n4) Hometown Hero\n\n“The Decision” will always be a negative aspect of James’ career\n\nWhy is Lebron James hated so much? Well when you embarrass your hometown on national television people will tend to think you’re a jerk.  “The Decision”  which aired on June 8, 2o10 on ESPN is one decision that Lebron James wishes he could change. Not necessarily joining the Heat, but how he handled the whole situation. Instead of just having it announced like any other athlete, he decided to torture the Cleveland faithful even more by giving them just a glimmer of hope that he’d return only to take it away in an instant. Also it doesn’t help when you say that you made the decision that morning. Doesn’t look like you put that much effort into it. Personally I don’t think that going to the Heat instead of playing Cleveland should hurt Lebron’s legacy. However, Jordan did stay with one team and did win for the hometown team instead of leaving. For me though I think just how he handled the decision and turn it into a publicity stunt will hurt his legacy more in the long-run then actually leaving Cleveland.\n\n3) Jordan’s impressive 6-0\n\nJordan’s perfect tile record is one thing James will never be able to accomplish\n\nIf Michael Jordan was a movie he’d be known as The Lord of the Rings. While he may not have the most rings, there is no question that his perfect NBA title record is unmatched. While you could possibly beat Jordan any other time of the year, when the lights where brightest and it was the final minute of the season, you had no chance. Jordan was clutch, and being able to go to six championships and win six rings in an amazing accomplishment. Heck if Jordan didn’t take off to play baseball he could have probably added another ring or two to his trophy case. Unfortunately for James, his 1 for 3 NBA finals record makes this is an easy win for Jordan. Even if James can pull out a title this season he’ll only would have won 50% of his NBA title shots. Sorry Lebron, Jordan’s got you beat here.\n\n2) His Royal Airness\n\nJordan is just as big of a winner off the court as on the court.\n\nJordans. Just saying that jars up the jump man image on the side of a sweet pair of sneakers. The “Air Jordan” brand has become a world-wide icon and cements Micheal Jordan as the most marketable athlete in history. James doesn’t have his own brand and will probably never come close to establishing a brand like Jordan has. Beyond the Jordan brand, while James will probably make more money off of endorsements then Jordan, his airness did create the market for modern-day stars. Jordan was a trailblazer for sports marketing and has allowed for athletes to get the endorsements they do to this day. Jordan’s impact is incredible when you realize how he’s become integrated into modern-day culture. Even today he is still a marketing juggernaut even after stepping off the hardwood more than a decade ago. Think about it Jordans, McDonald’s, Hanes, Gatorade, Coca Cola, Ball Park Franks, Wheaties and Chevrolet. Chances are you still have a favorite MJ commercial you remember and that you’ve seen all of his commercials from these brands. As for James, his only commercials are with Nike and his most memorable one is when he had this pity party commercial because people now looked at him as the villain. Sorry James MJ wins with impact, volume, variety, and doesn’t whine when it comes to his commercials. Also the man played with Bug Bunny in Space Jam! Seriously every kid I know has seen that movie. Have you played basketball with a world-famous cartoon character? Nope didn’t think so Lebron.  Click here for a trip down memory lane.\n\n1 ) Coming through in the clutch\n\nNow one was a better closer then 23\n\nGame 7, clock about to expire, your team needs a basket who do you give the ball to? I’m betting that if you could choose any player to take the winning shot, it would be Jordan. This basket at the end of the 99 Finals is one of those moments when Jordan came through in the clutch. In the face of adversity Jordan always seemed to come up big. Whether it was game winning shots, dunks, or being able to overcome the flu (click here), Jordan’s career was filled with coming through in the biggest moments. James, on the other hand, has come up short in big spots. Sure he had the game winner against the Pacers this year, but other than the game winner in Cleveland a few years ago what has he done? Not only has Jordan created more clutch moments but, but he’s done it on the biggest stage in the finals. Has Lebron made any memorable plays in the finals? Jordan has, heck you could have a highlight show of all his memorable moments in the finals. In the end there is no question that when you want a game winning basket, you’re giving the rock to Jordan.\n\nWhile I still find it difficult to pick between these two players, they’re both very different players in very different eras, in the end of the Jordan versus James debate it is clear that Jordan is the clear winner. Sure Lebron could break his scoring records and even title wins, but at the end of the day no player had a greater impact on the game of basketball then Michael Jordan. While statistically both these men are very close, and you could argue Lebron is superior, when you combine all of the other factors MJ is the clear victor. No athlete has had such an impact both on and off the court as Jordan has. While Lebron may truly end up being the king, there is no question that Jordan will always be the greatest.\n\nShare this:\n\nRelated\n\nPost navigation\n\nOne thought on “Why Michael Jordan’s legacy is already greater than Lebron James”\n\nPingback: Can they be stopped?

From my perspective, I believe no other basketball player has dominated at the same level that James has had for this longevity. However, with this said, I am also a person who respects others’ opinions and am curious to understand their reasoning behind who they believe is the G.O.A.T. For example, if you believe Player X is the greatest, I will not attempt to change your mind since that is your opinion.\n\nMany people have their opinions on who the G.O.A.T is whether it be Kareem, Wilt, Bill Russell, etc. However, for the most part, many believe that either LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the G.O.A.T. I will focus on those two but not dive deep on what the two have accomplished nor their stats nor their impact. Instead, I will look at the one argument that people love to use in this debate and how it, to an extent, nettles me. That argument, of course, is the 6–0 argument.\n\nIt is a known fact that Michael Jordan went an impressive 6–0 in the NBA Finals through his 15-year career. Meanwhile, LeBron James has gone 4–6 in the finals through year 17. While these are both legendary accomplishments, some people try to penalize LeBron for accomplishing this as if it was bad to make the finals.\n\nHere’s what I mean; some people try to degrade LeBron’s legacy by citing how he was a “loser” in the finals while MJ was a “winner.” Now some people will say “How many times has MJ played the Warriors?” but to be honest it’s not even that. It’s the fact that people are trying to punish LeBron for making it to the finals for basically this past decade. Seriously, I don’t understand this narrative.\n\nThese same people say that LeBron cannot even approach Jordan because of his losing record. Well, the fact of the matter is that Michael Jordan failed to make an NBA final till his SEVENTH season. Meanwhile, LeBron James made the Finals in his FOURTH season. Now I can already see how people are saying, “LeBron didn’t make the playoffs his first two seasons” but Jordan also didn’t make the playoffs in Washington. I mean at the end of the day, it is the greatest basketball career of all time not the greatest six years of all time so longevity matters. Plus, that was Jordan’s 15th season where he wasn’t winning games while this is LeBron’s 17th season where he has won a title.\n\nSimply put, I don’t understand how LeBron losing finals can hurt his legacy. In any way, it should be helping his legacy since making the finals is an accomplishment in itself. I mean the NBA awards both finals participants a trophy for their hard work. Imagine going to Tokyo next year; Would you rather win six gold medals or four gold and six silver medals?\n\nThe whole 6–0 Jordan argument has got to stop. Bluntly put, the 6–0 notion is not something which people should be using when comparing Jordan to others.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n4\n\nPublished in Top Level Sports\n\nVariety sports publication featuring opinions, analysis, and more\n\nWritten by Nibodh Vallapureddy\n\nFootball | Basketball | Market Enthusiast | Writer | Thinker |\n\nResponses (4)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

James was incredible against the Warriors, posting back-to-back 41-point games when Cleveland was facing elimination, then recording a triple double in an epic Game 7.\n\nJames is now 3â4 in the Finals, with performances ranging from meltdown to miraculous. How does James's 2016 series stack up with the rest of Finals appearances? Weâve ranked all seven of them below:\n\nâ¢Â Get SIâs Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Championship package\n\n7. 2011 Finals\n\nâ17.8 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game\n\nLeBronâs first Finals with the Heat was easily the worst of his career. James struggled against the Mavericks, who flummoxed him with a zone defense and an uncanny ability to keep him out of the paint. The series was catnip for his critics, who could point to LeBronâsÂ fourth-quarter stats as evidence of his inability to perform in the clutch. He was shockingly passive at times in the series, refusing to take J.J. BareaÂ into the post and failing to dominate his matchups defensively. Of course, the series likely set the stage for Jamesâs return to form and was the beginning of his biblical arc in Miami.Â\n\n6. 2007 Finals\n\nâ22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG\n\nA young James was no match for the veteran Spurs in 2007. The Cavaliers were swept, with Gregg PopovichÂ daring LeBron to shoot from the outside for much of the series. With space on the perimeter, James couldnât capitalize with his inconsistent shot. To Cleveland's credit, this series was close over the final couple games. After the sweep, Tim Duncan told LeBron that James would soon be the face of the NBA. Little did Duncan know he and LeBron would still have epic battles to come.\n\n5. 2014 Finals\n\nâ28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG\n\nThe Heat were outclassed by the Spurs in 2014, but by no stretch was LeBron to blame. People may remember the cramps from Game 1, but LeBron was outstanding during this series. He was failed by his teammates, with a limpingÂ Dwyane Wade often barely in the frame on defense and Chris Bosh struggling against San Antonioâs frontcourt. James was extremely efficient against the Spursâ defense, a testament to how much his jumper had improved since his first go-around with PopovichÂ seven years earlier. James shot 57.1% from the field and nearly 52% from three, and the series was ultimately an injustice to his performance.Â\n\nâ¢Â LeBronÂ James: âIâm coming home to Clevelandâ\n\n4. 2013 Finals\n\nâ25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG\n\nThere were so many huge LeBron moments from this series. His emphatic block of Tiago Splitter in Game 2. A Batman-and-Batman game from James and Wade in Game 4. And a clutch jumperâhis MJ momentâto clinch Game 7. But letâs talk about Game 6. People love to say LeBron was saved by Ray Allenâs three pointer. This is a horrible opinion. James was unreal on that unforgettable night. Remember when he lost his headband and seemingly found a new level of power? James left every single thing he had on the floor in that game, posting more than 30 points and a triple double to help save the Heatâs season. This was LeBron at his finest. He was everywhere on the court defensively. He anchored lineups in which he was surrounded by four shooters, lifting Miami to new heights offensively. He did everything and more that had been asked of him, and James is more responsible than Allen when it comes to protecting his legacy.\n\nOh, and James was equally special in the closeout, scoring 37 to seal the deal on his second straight championship.\n\nLeBron James Off the Court\n\nAnd so it begins....\n\nLebron went with a stuffed elephant over a basketball for this portrait.\n\nA high-school aged LeBron poses during a Field of Dreams-inspired photo shoot in 2002.\n\nJames didn't always boast a 250-pound frame, but has always been an intimidating presence, having averaged 21 points per game as a freshman in high school.\n\nSt. Vincent-St. Mary games were often broadcast on national television and played in college arenas during James' time with the Irish. He never did play in a college game, though.\n\nDespite all the fanfare and attention surrounding James in his high school years, the kid destined for stardom stayed hungry.\n\nLeBron got to meet Michael Jordan while His Airness was still playing. Jordan had just finished playing against the Cavaliers in this 2003 picture.\n\nLeBron's younger brother, Frankie, accompanies LeBron at the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nBecause what else would James watch in his leisure time?\n\nDon't we all wish we could be teenage superstars with a limo stocked with Tootsie Pops.\n\nLeBron goes all \"Cat in the Hat\" while speaking to kids at a Cavaliers Read to Achieve event in 2003.\n\nLeBron shows off his pearly whites during an NBA photo shoot in 2003.\n\nLeBron celebrates his 21st birthday by sharing the mic with rapper Lil' Wayne.\n\nJames' kid-friendly image has been shaped by his life as a father. He has three children with his high school sweetheart Savannah Brinson â LeBron Jr., Bryce Maximus, and Zhuri.\n\nLeBron James: MVP, All-Star, scoring champ and ... MC Hammer look-alike at the 2007 ESPYs.\n\nFans and experts alike wonder how good LeBron could have been as a pro football player, given his size and strength. He was an All-State wide receiver in high school, and even Packers president Mark Murphy has compared his skills to Jerry Rice's.\n\nAnd if he decides to pull a Michael Jordan and try a career in baseball, it looks like LeBron may have a bright future in that, as well.\n\nJames, decked out in warm-ups of his high school alma mater, enjoys a chuckle with Jay-Z during the 2010 All-Star Weekend in Dallas.\n\nLeBron entered the 2010 offseason as the most sought-after free agent on the market. After contemplating a future in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Miami or a return to Cleveland, James chose to take his talents to South Beach where he could play with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nRegardless of the ill will, James still makes time for his fans. In this photo, The King plays Connect Four with children from the Miami Rescue Mission in 2010.\n\nLeBron joins 200 youth in a spontaneous \"chalk clap\" to dedicate a new athletic field at the Boys & Girls Club of Central Florida in 2010.\n\nJames joins Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade at a Miami performing arts center to celebrate Bosh's 28th birthday in March 2012. No word on whether this newly formed band performed any songs for the audience.\n\nLeBron greets First Lady Michelle Obama at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\nLeBron enjoys some time at a club in London.\n\nTwo months after battling in the NBA Finals, James and Kevin Durant teamed up to win an Olympic gold medal in 2012.\n\nLeBron helps plant a tree during the 2013 NBA Cares Day of Service at the LIVE Project in Houston.\n\nLeBron enjoys a cigar after winning his second consecutive NBA championship and Finals MVP in 2013.\n\nLebron looks to be filming his role in the 2015 comedy \"Trainwreck\" with Bill Hader at a restaurant in New York City during the summer of 2014.\n\nKyrie Irving and LeBron James share a laugh on the bench during the Cavs 2014 preseason exhibition game with Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv in Cleveland.\n\nLebron James and Kevin Love attend The 2015 ESPYS in Los Angeles.\n\nLeBron smiles during a photo shoot in 2015.\n\nLeBron holds his 20-month old daughter Zhuri alongside his third NBA Finals MVP trophy following the Cavs' Game 7 victory over the Golden State Warriors in 2016.\n\nLeBron poses with some of the nation's top high school players during Nike's 2016 Skills Academy in a private hangar at the one-runway Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Los Angeles.\n\nKevin Love and LeBron James pose with foam fingers during the Cavs' 2016 media day in Independence, Ohio.\n\nLeBron celebrates during Game 2 of the 2016 ALCS between the Cleveland Indians and Toronto Blue Jays at Progressive Field in Cleveland.\n\nLeBron and the 2016 NBA champion Cavaliers were honored by President Barack Obama on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\nLeBron James throws a pass on the field as Cavs teammate J.R. Smith looks on before Ohio State's game against Michigan at the Horseshoe in 2016.\n\n3. 2012 Finals\n\nâ28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG\n\nJames completed his transformation from villain to heroâa feeling only he and Ye knowâwith a dominant series in the 2012 Finals. This was the only Finals of LeBronâs career in which it felt like he had a direct rival: Kevin Durant. James took the challenge. He outplayed his counterpart offensively and defended Durant during the gameâs key moments. James exhibited a hunger in this series that could only emerge after years of heartbreak. There was a memorable moment in the fifth and final game of the series when LeBronÂ grabbed a rebound over three defenders, missed a shot, got his own rebound, then made a layup while being fouled. The play was a perfect example of Jamesâs physical dominance and refusal to be contained. With a triple double in the closeout game, James ensured his legacy would be one of a championship winner.Â\n\nâ¢ LeBron wins Finals MVP | Best highlights from Game 7\n\n2. 2015 Finals\n\nâ35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG\n\nIn an underdog role without his best teammate, Kyrie Irving, James put the Cavaliers on his back in the 2015 Finals. His efficiency dropped as his counting stats rose, but James single-handedly managed to slow down the team that had been running roughshod through the NBA. Jamesâs performance wasnât enough to lead his team to a win, but it should have been worthy of the Finals MVP award. James slowed the game down against Golden State in 2015, often pounding the ball before going 1-on-5 at the end of the shot clock. Even when everyone in the world knew what was coming, James managed to pour in buckets while scrambling all over the place on defense. The look of exhaustion on Jamesâs face by the end of the series was more than well earned.Â\n\n1. 2016 Finals\n\n29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG\n\nAfter two years of Stephen Curry hype, James reclaimed his status as the best player in the NBA with an incredible Finals performance. Curry had earned all the accolades usually reserved for James during the regular season, as he was crowned (by many) the leagueâs best player and earned the NBAâs first unanimous MVP selection. But James thoroughly outplayed Curry for most of the Finals, and personally reminded Curry who the NBAâs top dog was with a degrading swatâand hilarious smirkâduring Game 6. LeBron went up against all odds in this seriesâdown 3â1 entering Game 5, going against the winningest regular season team in NBA historyâbut showed that he himself could serve as an equalizer in the face of so many narratives. Jamesâs back-to-back 40-point explosions in Games 5 and 6 sent a message to every single fan of the NBA: When LeBron James is locked in, thereâs no one capable of stopping him.Â\n\nRohan Nadkarni covers the NBA for SI.com.

The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.

            "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

LeBron James is clearly still the best player in the world, and the only thing he has yet to prove is to exceed the Michael Jordan comparison. While LeBron James is a completely different player to MJ and plays a different position, the debate will always be there as Jordan is considered the greatest player of all time and the standard for all great players.\nOne topic of comparison is always the competition both legends faced and the road they took to winning NBA championships. Jordan has 6 rings compared to LeBron's 4, but LeBron might have had the tougher competition when narrowing down each Finals' appearance. However, Jordan might have faced the best all-around players in his 6 Finals appearances whereas LeBron played better teams. Nonetheless, it is time to capture each player's NBA Finals appearances by assessing the competition.\nMichael Jordan\n\n1991 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Magic Johnson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Vlade Divac (Hall of Famer), James Worthy (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team)\nMJ's first NBA Finals appearance was a positive one, as was the case for all of MJ's NBA rings. Jordan and the Bulls led the charge against legendary point guard Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. In a showdown between the 2 best players in the era, this was an amazing series whereby Jordan stamped his mark on the league. MJ and the Bulls fell in Game 1, before closing out the series in 5. MJ was the key player all series long, with Scottie Pippen adding in a sensational 32-point game in Game 5 to help MJ close it out. The Lakers finished 3rd in the league that season compared to the Bulls finishing first, and the Jordan era officially began in the 1991 Finals.\n1992 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Clyde Drexler (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Buck Williams (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis is known as the series where Michael Jordan took things personally. Clyde Drexler led the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1st seed in the Western Conference against the 1st seeded Chicago Bulls. Drexler was thought to be at least equal competition to Michael Jordan, which MJ wanted to prove wrong. Drexler held his own with sensational performances in the series, but MJ had too many key moments such as hitting 6 threes in the 1st quarter of Game 1 and then dropping 33 points in a closeout Game 6. Jordan would simply not allow the series to go to 7, as he was ruthless in making it clear Drexler doesn't come close to his greatness.\n1993 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Charles Barkley (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Dan Majerle (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nThis was probably the toughest opponent for Michael Jordan. Led by league MVP Charles Barkley, the Suns had the best record in the West while Chicago fell to the #2 seed. As great as Barkley and defensive specialist Dan Majerle were, Jordan and the Bulls were just better. The Bulls took the first 2 games of the series before Phoenix won in 3-OT in Game 3. Jordan responded with 55 points in Game 4 before he made the iconic pass to John Paxson for the game-winning three. Barkley was a dominant player in the series but Jordan was near perfection all series long and he once again did not allow for a Game 7.\n1996 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Gary Payton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Shawn Kemp (All-NBA 2nd Team)\nAfter a brief retirement, Michael Jordan returned to the NBA to continue the MJ-era. Jordan wasn't going away anytime soon, and he led the charge against defensive phenom Gary Payton and athletic glass cleaner Shawn Kemp. MJ and the Bulls went 72-10 in the regular season, as they went to battle with the number one seed in the West. The Bulls were up 3-0 in the series before Payton and Kemp fought back to win 2 straight. Jordan struggled from the floor in Game 6 shooting 5-19, but he had enough help from Pippen and Rodman to close out the series and win Finals MVP in yet another Game 6 closeout.\n1997 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team, All-NBA 2nd Defensive Team)\nMJ and the Bulls made their 5th straight NBA Finals appearance against Karl Malone and John Stockton, who led the Jazz to the best record in the Western Conference. The Bulls won the first 2 games before Utah evened it up in 4. In the legendary \"Flu Game\", Jordan dropped 38 points and willed Chicago to victory in one of the most iconic moments. Jordan then had another iconic moment when he found Steve Kerr for the game-winning shot to capture his 5th title and 5th Finals MVP. Stockton and Malone were a great duo and this presented a massive challenge to MJ and the Bulls, so Jordan's unselfishness in Game 6 was one of his greatest moments.\n1998 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Karl Malone (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), John Stockton (Hall of Famer)\nWas there ever any doubt that Jordan would reach the Finals again? He already had one 3-peat with the Bulls and wanted to do it again. The #1 seeded Bulls led the charge against the #1 seeded Utah Jazz led by Hall of Fame duo Karl Malone and John Stockton. Malone and Stockton had taken Game 1 before Chicago answered with 3 straight victories. After Utah stole Game 5, Jordan had one of the most iconic moments in history by stripping Karl Malone on one end and hit the game-winning shot over Bryon Russell to capture his 6th NBA title and 6th Finals MVP.\nLeBron James\n\n2007 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 1st Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Bruce Bowen (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron's first Finals appearance did not go as he planned, mainly because he was outmatched on both ends of the floor. The Spurs were simply a better team than the Cavaliers as they had 3 Hall of Famers playing under a Hall of Fame coach. Bruce Bowen also made an All-NBA Defensive Team which made life particularly difficult for LeBron in this series. This was a tough series for LeBron as the Cavs were swept, and LeBron does get a pass for most people on this one.\n2011 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Dirk Nowitzki (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Jason Kidd (Hall of Famer), Tyson Chandler (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron's 2nd Finals' appearance also did not go as planned. He had a Superteam with the Miami Heat with the likes of Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh by his side, and they were the heavy favorites coming into the series. In possibly the most shocking way, LeBron played much below his usual level and the Heat were beaten in 6 games by the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki was the best player during the playoffs and LeBron James was nowhere near as great. This is a big black mark on LeBron's legendary career for sure.\n2012 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Russell Westbrook (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), James Harden (Hall of Famer), Serge Ibaka (All-Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron James made amends for his prior Finals appearance disaster by leading the Heat Superteam against the Oklahoma City Thunder who had their own younger Superteam. Led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder had athleticism and youth on their side along with an exceptional 6th man in James Harden and an All-NBA Defensive Team player in Serge Ibaka. The Heat were simply too good with their Big Three, and LeBron James finally played like the best player in the series to win his first NBA title.\n2013 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team, All-Defensive 2nd Team), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer)\nLeBron's 2nd NBA title came against the San Antonio Spurs, who should have beaten LeBron James and the Miami Heat. Known as the series where Ray Allen made the most clutch shot in NBA history, the Heat fought back and won the series despite being down 3-2. LeBron James was once again the best player in the series, and he willed his team to victory in this series against 4 Hall of Fame Spurs players. Head coach Gregg Popovich forced LeBron to beat them with jumpers, and he did that on his way to winning his 2nd straight Finals MVP.\n2014 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Tim Duncan (Hall of Famer), Tony Parker (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Manu Ginobili (Hall of Famer), Kawhi Leonard (Hall of Famer, All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron James once again was in the Finals with the Miami Heat for the 4th time in a row, this time falling short to the Spurs who exacted their revenge. The Spurs were on a mission this season and the growth of Kawhi Leonard into a star helped San Antonio blow out the Heat in the series. Leonard won Finals MVP, and LeBron could not do enough to counter the Spurs' new Big Four. Dwyane Wade looked older in this series and LeBron James had to settle for another Finals loss in his record.\n2015 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team), Andrew Bogut (All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nOnce again, LeBron James made the Finals this time with his hometown team Cleveland Cavaliers. With Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love by his side, LeBron James made the Cavs the favorite in the Eastern Conference. Making it all the way to the Finals, they are up against Stephen Curry and the revolutionary Warriors team who introduced the small-ball lineup with Andre Iguodala playing the power forward spot. Unfortunately for LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love went down with injures leaving him to fend off the Big Three Warriors by himself. He had a sensational series, but the Warriors had too much with Andre Iguodala winning Finals MVP over LeBron James and sending him home with a loss.\n2016 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nThe greatest achievement in LeBron's career came in the 2016 NBA Finals, whereby he played the Warriors against this time with a healthy Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. The Cavs were down 3-1 in the series, and it looked like LeBron would have to suffer yet another loss in the Finals. But he took his game to another level, and alongside Kyrie Irving, were too dominant for the Warriors as they won the NBA title in a historic comeback. LeBron was the undisputed best player in the series, although Kyrie Irving hit the biggest shot of the game in Game 7 to win the series.\n2017 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 2nd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 1st Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs once again made the NBA Finals to play the Warriors, except Golden State added superstar player Kevin Durant to join their Big Three of Curry, Thompson, and Green. LeBron still had Irving and Love, but the Warriors were just unstoppable with Kevin Durant as they beat down the Cavs convincingly. LeBron held his own and would have been Finals MVP in the victory, but Durant and the Warriors were too dominant on both ends as KD won Finals MVP and added the 5th Finals loss to LeBron's record.\n2018 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Kevin Durant (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 1st Team), Stephen Curry (Hall of Famer, All-NBA 3rd Team), Klay Thompson (Hall of Famer), Draymond Green (Hall of Famer, All-NBA Defensive 2nd Team)\nLeBron and the Cavs made the NBA Finals yet again, this time without Kyrie Irving who was traded to Boston. It is a shame LeBron did not have his little brother Irving by his side because their duo was truly exciting to watch. Without Irving, LeBron had to lead average players to battle against the Golden State Warriors juggernaut led by Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry. In one of the most embarrassing Finals moments in history, J.R. Smith dribbled out the clock instead of helping the Cavs snatch Game 1. LeBron put forth a Goliath 50-point performance that went to waste, effectively ending the series the Cavs lost 4-0.\n2020 NBA Finals\nCompetition: Jimmy Butler (All-NBA 3rd Team), Bam Adebayo (All-Defensive 2nd Team)\nWith LeBron's 3rd NBA team, he won his 4th NBA title. While certainly not the toughest opponent that LeBron faced and the easiest challenge in both MJ's and LeBron's competition, James and the Lakers beat the Heat in 6 games. LeBron James had Anthony Davis by his side, while Jimmy Butler was left to fend for himself as both Bam Adebayo and starting point guard Goran Dragic were out with injuries. Butler held his own with iconic performances, but LeBron and Davis were the best duo in the NBA and the Lakers were too good for any team in the league. While LeBron's easiest challenge, the Heat were no pushovers as LeBron James had to play at an MVP level to win his 4th Finals MVP.\nNext\nRanking The 10 Greatest Teammates That Michael Jordan Has Ever Had In His Career\n2020 NBA Free Agency: Ranking Top 15 Best Players Who Could Be Available\nRanking The 10 Greatest NBA Players Of The 90s\nRanking LeBron James’ 10 Best Teams In The NBA Finals\nLos Angeles Lakers Have 6 Of Top 10 Greatest Players Of All-Time\n\nBy\nEddie Bitar\nEddie Bitar is a senior staff writer at Fadeaway World, renowned for his insightful blend of sports journalism with economic and financial expertise.

The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nWinners\n\n^ |

            "raw_content": "The Hoops Loop\n\nNBA History: Ranking LeBron James’ Top 5 Playoff Performances\n\nIntroduction & Criteria\n\nLeBron James, arguably the greatest player in NBA history, has played an equivalent of 3.5 full NBA seasons worth of Playoff basketball, 287 games, good enough for first place in NBA history. Throughout his illustrious career he has seen both highs and lows, whilst providing the basketball community with unforgettable performances for the ages. Therefore, I have tasked myself with the impossible mission of ranking, specifically, his top 5 playoff performances.\n\nTo rank a player’s performance in the NBA, let alone, LeBron James, is no small task. Therefore, to assist in being able to categorise and create an objective ranking, a set of criteria will be utilised to meet the aim of creating an accurate ranking.\n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n\nEach facet will be measured out of a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best and 0 the worst. The total will be ranked and measured out of a scale of 50.\n\n5. 2020 Finals Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 44/50\n\nIn a closeout game with the Lakers looking to finish off the Miami Heat and lay claim to the 2020 NBA title, LeBron James was determined as ever to get another championship on his third team. The King poured in 40 points on an unbelievable 71.4 FG%, on top of this, he managed to pull down 13 rebounds and dished out 7 assists.\n\nPlaying out of his traditional Small Forward position that he has played throughout the majority of his career, and instead at the helm of the Lakers offense as the teams point guard. The high usage, touches and ultimately responsibility further emphasis how impressive of a performance he delivered in game 5, particularly, in respect to his overall efficiency.\n\nIn the end, Game 5 came down to the wire as the infamous playoff riser, Jimmy Butler, served the Lakers an ice cold 35-point triple double. The Heats defence, a Danny Green missed shot (wide open), coupled with Jimmy’s heroics put the Lakers away in the do-or-die game for the Heat. Thus, like many of LeBron’s iconic performances, the team could not match his level of effort to pull out the win.\n\n4. 2007 ECF Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 46/50\n\nAt just 22 years old, willing a poorly constructed Cavaliers roster to heights beyond anyones expectations. This performance could be considered the genesis of the legend of LeBron, where he looked like a kid playing at the local park, a video game character, mythical, to say the least.\n\nJames’ performance against the rough and tough Detroit Pistons is defined by the staple closing period of the game, where James went unconscious by putting 25 straight points on the board to edge the Cavs over the Pistons, this would position the Cavs 3-2, in an eventual series win, proving to be the pivotal moment, not only in the game but the series.\n\nThe momentum changing game would provide the Cleveland Cavaliers with a franchise first NBA Finals appearance. A historical achievement, that in hindsight, adds further weight and significance to the feats LeBron reached during game 5.\n\nIt’s not common that young superstars display such dominance, maturity and responsibility in their game, but LeBron James was able to do just that in his showing during Game 5. A performance that has yet to be toppled by the rising stars of the NBA since.\n\n3. 2012 ECF Game 6\n\nPerformance score: 47/50\n\nAt the time of Game 6, LeBron was down a 3-2 deficit to the dynastic Boston Celtics of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This series was on the back of the disaster showing in the previous seasons final, where the Heat fell to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt was a legacy game, a turning point in LeBron’s career. If they lost, would the Heat have to rethink things over and blow it up? Is LeBron capable of leading a team to the mountain top? All these questions and much more loomed over the team like a dark cloud.\n\n\n\nUnrelenting, and defiant in preserving the Miami Heat, who were on a lifeline at this point in the series. LeBron, as seen in the thumbnail image above, had a look in his eye, only comparable to a lion stalking its prey. He attacked the Boston Celtics with brute force, finesse fadeaways from the mid-post and athletic finishes around the rim.\n\nHe silenced the Celtics superteam and the raging home crowd with 45-points on 73.1% shooting, along with 15 rebounds and 5 assists. A performance that turned down the volume on the critics within the media and NBA fanbase, and proved that nothing was going to deter LeBron from getting his first ring.\n\nThis infamous game lives on as one of the most iconic games of his career, and arguably one of the greatest performances of all time.\n\n2. 2016 Finals Game 7\n\nPerformance score: 49.5/50\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the greatest NBA game of all time, the historic series comeback by the Cavaliers, scratching and clawing their way back into the series after being knocked down 3-1, against the greatest regular season team of all time.\n\nThe unquantifiable pressure emanating from Oracle Arena on June 19, 2016 could be felt through television screens halfway around the world. The stakes couldn’t get any higher, it was up to the stars to prove to the world whether they could step into the limelight. An underlying narrative was that LeBron had promised to raise a banner for the city of Cleveland, in his return from his Miami Heat stint. More pressure than ever was on Jame to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he did. The King produced an all around masterclass, a 27 point triple-double. Additionally, an amazing stat to put into perspective just how important James was during the crucial game is that he contributed to 50% of the Cavaliers points directly, either by assist or scoring (27 points, 19 points created from assists). The unreal offensive control was complemented by stellar defense, which birthed the iconic and arguably greatest highlight of LeBron’s career “The Block”.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to not place this as the greatest game of his career due to the unreal performance on both sides of the floor, the stakes and ultimately, the outcome of the iconic game.\n\n1. 2018 Finals Game 1\n\nPerformance score: 50/50\n\nIn a series that perfectly emulates the biblical story of David versus Goliath, LeBron James established a new precedent with his Game 1 performance. Before the series began, many within the media and broader NBA community assumed that the Golden State Warriors would trample over the one man army Cavaliers in dominant and blown-out fashion. Despite the series ending in a sweep, it was held much closer than pundits anticipated, largely due to James’ historic play.\n\nIn Game 1, LeBron showed utter offensive domination, with balanced inside-out scoring throughout the competition. He finished the game with a jaw-dropping 51 points (playoff career high), to go along with a near triple double of 8 rebounds and 8 assists. On top of this, he shot 43% from the 3-point range and 59% as a whole from the field. It was the cherry on top of the cake in terms of performances during his historical 2018 playoff season run.\n\nTherefore, this performance ranks as his best in my opinion, and the greatest NBA Finals performance of all time because:\n\nShare this:\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n"

            "raw_content": "Top 10 LeBron James' NBA Playoff games\n\nLeBron James is easily a top-3 player in the history of the NBA Playoffs, which makes ranking his 10 greatest games an arduous task for anyone. The King has dominated the NBA in recent times, unlike any other player.\n\nEarly in his career, it was all about his athleticism and carefree abandon that came with youth. With experience, he became a more lethal player, as he used a combination of his world-class athleticism and analytical mind to outhink and outmanoevre opponents.\n\nOn that note, let us have a look at 10 such games in the NBA Playoffs, where LeBron James produced his most memorable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeBron James' ten greatest games in the NBA Playoffs\n\nLeBron James is the undisputed greatest active player in the NBA and arguably one of the greatest of all time. Unsurprisingly, he has often reserved his best for the business end of the competition - the NBA Playoffs.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe King, as LeBron James is often known as, is an all-time great NBA playoff performer and also the all-time leader in games played (282). From such a significant sample size, it is indeed a challenging proposition to handpick a few games as he has had memorable performances galore.\n\nNevertheless, let us have a look at LeBron James' 10 best performances in the NBA Playoffs. Without further ado, let's get started.\n\n#10 LeBron James vs OKC Thunder - Game 4 (2012 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 26 points | 12 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 10/20 FG | 44 minutes\n\nDespite his unquestionable talent and pedigree, LeBron James was surprisingly ringless when he arrived in the 2012 NBA Playoffs against OKC Thunder. But that would change by the end of that finals series.\n\nThe 2012 NBA #Finals MVP - LeBron James!  http://t.co/SlHygrml\n\nIn the fourth game of that series against the Thunder, the Miami Heat were up 2-1 but needed to increase their lead in Miami before going back to OKC for the final two games of the series.\n\nA win by OKC in Miami would have meant that the series would have been decided in the former's home, but LeBron James managed to ensure that that did not happen. OKC's best chance to win a game in Miami was in that fourth game of the series, but LeBron James, despite struggling with physical issues in the fourth quarter, had other ideas.\n\nAfter getting afflicted by cramps in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter, LeBron James returned to the court and hit his only three-point shot of the night when the scores were tied at 94-all.\n\nIt was a shot in the arm for the Miami Heat, who went on to close the game with a 12-4 run to take a 3-1 lead in the series. In the next game of the series, Miami blew OKC off the floor, as LeBron James won his first NBA title and was also named the Finals MVP.\n\n#9 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 7 (2018 ECF)\n\nStats: 35 points | 9 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 blocks | 12/24 FG | 48 minutes\n\nIn his last season to date playing for an Eastern Conference team, LeBron James dominated the 2018 Eastern Conference Playoffs despite not having a great supporting cast around him (at least while facing a Western Conference team in the finals).\n\n33.9 PPG8.9 RPG8.8 APGLeBron James came to play in the 2018 #NBAPlayoffs! 🏀: #WhateverItTakes x #CUsRise GAME 7 ⏰: 8:30pm/et 📺:@ESPNNBA pic.twitter.com/YdZeo4W0Lb\n\nIn the deciding game of that year's Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James had a memorable night in front of a Boston crowd who witnessed The King's prowess first hand.\n\nLeBron James played every minute of the Cleveland Cavaliers' 87-79 victory on the road against the Celtics. Despite a high number of turnovers (eight), James had an incredible night.\n\nWith Boston up by one point entering the fourth quarter, LeBron James scored 12 in the deciding period on 4/6 from the field and dished out four assists to reach his ninth NBA Finals, his eighth on the trot.\n\n#8 LeBron James vs Indiana Pacers - Second Round - Game 4 (2012 NBA Playoffs)\n\nStats: 40 points | 9 assists | 18 rebounds | 2 steals | 2 blocks | 14/27 FG | 44 minutes\n\nLeBron James' run to his first NBA championship in the 2012 NBA Playoffs was characterised by pressure, which the player experienced every game.\n\nA Decade of Dominance!@KingJames & Miami climb to the top in 2012 & 2013 (via @SekouSmithNBA): https://t.co/8RYwcSaMZX pic.twitter.com/z6hw8fIsWh\n\nIn the second round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs, LeBron James and the Heat were down 2-1 against the Indiana Pacers after losing two games in a row and scoring only 75 points in each match.\n\nIn game four at Indiana, the pressure was at a crescendo because the team had failed the year before and was close to faltering in the NBA Playoffs again.\n\nNevertheless, LeBron James destroyed the Pacers with his first 40-point game in the NBA Playoffs for the Heat. That tied the series at two-all. There was more pressure against the Boston Celtics in the Conference semi-finals before LeBron James and the Miami Heat managed to go all the way.\n\n#7 LeBron James vs Miami Heat - Game 6 (2020 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 28 points | 10 assists | 14 rebounds | 1 turnover | 13/20 FG | 41 minutes\n\nIn his most recent game in his NBA Playoffs career - Game 6 of the 2020 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat - LeBron James reinforced his claim for a place among the NBA's all-time greats.\n\nThe 2020 Bill Russell #NBAFinals MVP... LeBron James of the @Lakers! #LakeShow pic.twitter.com/jyAko4pjbN\n\nLeBron James led the LA Lakers' to a 106-93 victory over the Miami Heat to help secure the franchise's record-equalling 17th NBA title. In the process, James won his fourth ring to go with his fourth Finals MVP award which he won with a third different team (the only player to ever do so).\n\nJames rose to the fore when he was required the most to seal the title for the Lakers in a difficult year for the city and the franchise.\n\nThe player capped his tenth NBA Finals by averaging 30 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists on 59% shooting from the field and 42% from the three. Arguably, that was James' greatest ever performance, in terms of stats, in an NBA Finals/NBA Playoffs series.\n\n#6 LeBron James vs Detroit Pistons - Game 5 (2007 ECF)\n\nStats: 48 points | 7 assists | 9 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 50 minutes\n\nThis was LeBron James' greatest game in his career in the NBA Playoffs for many, which came against the Detroit Pistons in game five of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIf anyone needed further proof of LeBron James' arrival among the NBA's elite in history, they need not look further than this game. LeBron James is called 'The King' for several reasons, one of them being his performances in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nAgainst one of the greatest defensive teams of the modern era, James put up an amazing performance to get a double-overtime win for the Cavs, who took a 3-2 lead before wrapping up the series at home in game six.\n\nLeBron James scored the last 25 points for Cleveland in his first-ever appearance in an ECF against a team that was playing their fourth consecutive ECF and had won the NBA title in 2004 and reached the NBA Finals in 2005.\n\n#5 LeBron James vs Denver Nuggets - Game 5 (2020 WCF)\n\nStats: 38 points | 10 assists | 16 rebounds | 15/25 FG | 40 minutes\n\nWith the LA Lakers up 3-1 in the 2020 Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, the talk in the series was about Denver, as they had returned from 3-1 deficits in the previous two rounds of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nHowever, it was obvious that LeBron James would put an end to that narrative because those things have never happened to him in the NBA Playoffs. Lack of a killer instinct in the NBA Playoffs? No, James is simply different.\n\nIn game five, the Nuggets were hanging well with the Lakers, as they did in most games in that series (James was not having his greatest series at that point).\n\nLeBron James then took the game by the scruff of its neck in the fourth quarter, scoring 16 points on 7/10 shooting from the field to close the series and advance to his tenth NBA Finals, his ninth in the last ten years.\n\n#4 LeBron James vs San Antonio Spurs - Game 7 (2013 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 37 points | 4 assists | 12 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/33 FG | 5/10 3P | 45 minutes\n\nIn his first-ever game seven in an NBA Finals, LeBron James handled the pressure well to win back-to-back titles (after winning an epic game six). In this game, James proved that his perimeter shooting was good enough on the biggest of stages.\n\nIn the entire series, the Spurs gave up mid-range and three-point shots to LeBron James as a defensive tactic, trying to reduce James' impact when he entered the paint to find open shots for his teammates.\n\nThe ploy worked to an extent, as the San Antonio Spurs took a 3-2 lead and were certainly in a position to close the Heat out in game six before Ray Allen's all-time iconic shot tied the game, and Miami eventually took an OT win.\n\nJames made five of his ten attempts from the three in the deciding game after making only seven of 24 in the first six. His three-point range and a mid-range jump shot, with the Heat up by two points with 28 seconds remaining, sealed the game in Miami's favor.\n\nLeBron James also scored nine points in the fourth quarter to give the Heat back-to-back NBA championships. He earned his second Finals MVP too to close out a tremendous 2013 NBA Playoffs run.\n\n#3 LeBron James vs Boston Celtics - Game 6 (2012 ECF)\n\nStats: 45 points | 5 assists | 15 rebounds | 2 steals | 18/26 FG | 45 minutes\n\nIn easily his most efficient and impactful game of his NBA Playoffs career, LeBron James dominated the Boston Celtics at the TD Garden with one of the NBA's best individual performances ever seen.\n\nThis was a ring-less LeBron James facing a team that had won the NBA championship in 2008 and played in the Finals in 2010, both times eliminating James' team in the NBA Playoffs along the way.\n\nThis time, James' team was certainly the more favored, one but Boston won three straight games to take a 3-2 lead. With home court advantage in game six, it was looking good for the Doc Rivers-coached team.\n\nHowever, Rajon Rondo, Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen had to experience one of their toughest losses during their tenure together in the NBA Playoffs. James scored 30 points (12/14 FG) in the first half to put the Heat up 55-42 after 24 minutes.\n\nHe then made timely shots in the second half to break Boston's heart before shutting down their comeback attempts with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists on 73% shooting. In game seven, the Heat overwhelmed Boston again to reach the 2012 NBA Finals, where LeBron James won his first NBA title.\n\n#2 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 6 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 41 points | 11 assists | 8 rebounds | 4 steals | 16/27 FG | 42 minutes\n\nThe 2016 NBA Finals was LeBron James' greatest series in his legendary NBA Playoffs career.\n\n#2 | TOP 20 CLUTCH PLAYS - 2010s🚫 \"OH, BLOCKED BY JAMES!\" 🚫@KingJames comes out of nowhere for the INCREDIBLE CHASEDOWN BLOCK in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA FINALS, sending the @cavs to their first-ever NBA championship! pic.twitter.com/cKT3zRFDiH\n\nNot only did he deliver the Cleveland Cavaliers their first NBA title, LeBron James also helped the team recover from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors to secure his third NBA championship.\n\nEn route to winning his third NBA Finals MVP during the Cavs' incredible comeback, James had an amazing game six - scoring 41 points and 11 assists - at home that helped his team tie the series. He also had four steals and three blocks in that game.\n\nIt was undoubtedly the brilliance of LeBron James that helped the Cavaliers recover from a deficit to force a seventh game in a memorable NBA Finals series.\n\n#1 LeBron James vs Golden State Warriors - Game 7 (2016 NBA Finals)\n\nStats: 29 points | 11 assists | 11 rebounds | 3 blocks | 9/24 FG | 47 minutes\n\nIn game seven of the extraordinary 2016 NBA Finals, LeBron James put up a performance for the ages.\n\nLeBron James is the unanimous 2016 NBA Finals MVP. pic.twitter.com/L4XDDXYlaT\n\nHe guided Cleveland to their first NBA championship with a game-seven Triple-Double (only the second ever in NBA Finals history) while also making key defensive plays that helped the franchise create history.\n\nLeBron James' memorable chase-down block on Andre Iguodala with the game tied at 89 was huge in the context of the series. Moreover, James led all scorers in the fourth quarter with 11 points (GSW scored 13 in the deciding quarter).\n\nCleveland won the series; James earned Finals MVP recognition, leading the series in every major stat category..\n\nThis performance was easily the greatest individual performance in the NBA Finals in the 21st century.\n\nAlso read: NBA Free Agency 2020: Advantage Golden State Warriors as rivals cry foul over reduced luxury tax.\n\nVictor R.

            "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"

One of the defining tests of NBA superstardom is a player’s ability to positively influence his teammates’ play. Stars can improve a teammate’s play through not only their own play, but also their presence; the greatest players of all-time carry an aura with them that embodies winning.\nFour-time NBA champion and Finals MVP LeBron James has illustrated this aura throughout the entirety of his 17-year career. James has the power to thrust his teammates into an unfamiliar position — directly in the spotlight.\nIf these players deliver when they are called upon, their legacies are cemented next to role players like Steve Kerr, whose famous 1997 Finals-winning shot lives on eternally in the Role Player Hall of Fame. Failure to deliver, however, means a player will be exposed to a level of scrutiny unlike ever before. This phenomenon experienced by James’ teammates can be known as the “LeBron Effect.”\n\nNelson Chenault-USA TODAY Sports\nJames’ impact on his teammates is so profound that his influence was felt not just by younger players, but also by accomplished veterans like Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo over last season.\nHere is a look at how James impacted the play of his teammates last season.\n\nHoward, Rondo experience veteran resurgence\nBefore their tenures with the Lakers, it seemed both Howard and Rondo were more destined for stardom in Ice Cube’s BIG3 league than a return to their NBA glory. And while a lack of talent was hardly the issue for either of the former All-NBA selections, accountability was.\nAfter stops in five different cities over the past five seasons, Dwight Howard arrived in Los Angeles on a last-chance deal. Playing alongside James sparked a newfound commitment to winning in Howard. For the first time in his career, he embraced his ideal role as a rim-protecting screen setter.\nEven when Howard was scoring over 20 points a night, he was never a great low post scorer, as most of his offense depended on his otherworldly athleticism. Despite this, Howard adamantly maintained his status among the league leaders in post-ups year after year. During the 2017-18 season (Howard’s last full season before this year), he ranked third in the NBA with 331 field goal attempts off post-ups. Low post scoring requires a soft-touch and grace that has eluded Howard his entire career.\nJames and the Lakers unlocked the optimal version of Howard. Instead of stagnating their offense by throwing the ball into a stationary Howard on the low block, Los Angeles leveraged his athleticism and screen-setting ability. In 69 games this season, Howard only attempted 23 shots out of post-ups.\nWhile Howard deserves credit for making the long-overdue adjustments to his game, it’s impossible to imagine him embracing a limited role off the bench that didn’t come at the James’ behest.\nFor as good as Howard was, Rondo’s resurgence was far more vital to the Lakers’ championship run. James’ greatest impact on Rondo came in the form of trust.\nOne of the hardest parts for any great NBA player is determining what responsibilities they can delegate over the course of 48 minutes. For a player with James’ playmaking prowess, conceding touches in the postseason and allowing a teammate to initiate the offense can be risky. But having an unflappable veteran point guard capable of taking the reins of the offense goes a long way in easing that feeling.\nRondo averaged 6.6 assists per game in the playoffs and served as the guiding hand for the Lakers’ bench units. In Los Angeles’ Game 4 win in the NBA Finals, Rondo orchestrated the pick and roll that ultimately set up Anthony Davis for the game-sealing three with under a minute remaining. Rondo is unafraid of any moment, and following the Lakers’ defeat in Game 5, he took the onus upon himself to put the Miami Heat away in Game 6.\nRondo began the game shooting 5-for-5 as part of a 19-point effort in the series’ closeout game. Aggressive drives in semi-transition opportunities like the one above depict how he sliced through Miami’s defense. As the postseason continued, Rondo looked more comfortable in not only attacking the basket, but also shooting.\nFor the playoffs, Rondo shot 40 percent (20-of-50) from three, a vast improvement for the career 31.6 percent long-range shooter. Although it seems highly unlikely that Rondo’s success from deep will translate over the course of an entire season, the threat of a jump shot alone made Rondo far more dangerous in the pick and roll. Even in the games that he did not shoot well, Rondo remained engaged and did the little things crucial for winning.\n\nEstablishing a name\nWhile James helped redefine the narratives surrounding some of the Lakers veterans’ careers, he also helped shape those of the younger Lakers. Alex Caruso went from a beloved meme on NBA Twitter to an invaluable piece capable of locking down opposing perimeter players and hitting timely shots.\nIn the 560 regular minutes that James and Caruso shared the floor, Los Angeles outscored their opponents by a staggering 18.6 points per 100 possessions. It did not matter who else occupied the other three spots on the floor, as James and Caruso’s presence in a lineup alone ensured the Lakers’ success.\nImitation is the highest form of flattery. While no one has perfected the chase down quite like James, Caruso’s rejection of James Harden on the play below was a visual embodiment of the effort Caruso plays with nightly. Unparalleled energy and passion paired with James’ unwavering confidence in him turned Caruso into a necessary ingredient in the Lakers championship recipe.\nNo Lakers player felt the negative aspects of the LeBron Effect more than Danny Green. In Game 5, James presented Green with his Steve Kerr opportunity, but history had other plans.\nOne missed shot does not define a legacy, but one made shot can. Even though the Lakers still went on to win the series and Green is now a three-time NBA champion, he will likely never get a chance at basketball immortality again. But even for as painful as the miss was, Markieff Morris’ turnover on the play was far more egregious, as James was standing wide open on the wing when Morris heaved the lob pass out of bounds.\nWhile James’ latest Finals victory has breathed new life into the G.O.A.T debate, do not expect his approach to falter. As the King continues chasing the legacy of a ghost in Chicago, he must continue to expect the same greatness he requires of himself from his teammates.\nRead Comments\n\nFind Your Next Springtime Adventure in OregonSpring trails, rushing rivers, and blooming valleys—see it all with a guide.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%201:)\nUndo\nA perfect pour on Oregon’s Food TrailsExperience Oregon’s Food Trails to find award-winning wineries, small-batch breweries and orchard-fresh cider.Travel Oregon| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)\nUndo\nA Party-Ready PatioThe Spruce| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-a-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%202:) Learn More\nUndo\nExperts Agree—This Little Orange Shot Could Be The Answer To Your Slow DigestionDose| [Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:)[Sponsored](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=larrybrownsports-larrybrownsports&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbs-feed-01-delta:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20|%20Card%203:) Shop Now\nUndo\nTop 10 worst cities to drive inEvery city has roads we wish were less traveled.

However, for LeBron, the meaning of success has shifted toward something more profound: inspiring others.“I think it comes down to, like, what does success mean to me now?

And that's what success for me is. I hope I can inspire the next generation of great players, great athletes, not only in just basketball, but in sport in general,” James explained.A crucial part of James’ message is the importance of longevity and self-care. As one of the most durable athletes in sports history, LeBron has placed a significant emphasis on maintaining both his physical and mental well-being.“What it means to take care of your body and, you know, keeping your mind fresh and understanding, like, being more driven by the process more than the actual ending goal,” James said.Rather than being solely focused on results, James believes true success lies in the journey—the commitment to self-improvement, discipline, and perseverance. His career is a testament to this mindset, as he continues to perform at an elite level deep into his NBA tenure.Beyond the court, James has built a brand and legacy that extend far beyond his athletic achievements. From philanthropy to business ventures, he has continually demonstrated the importance of creating opportunities that last beyond a playing career.“I hope that I can leave a blueprint for how to take care of your body, how to be a great athlete, and how to be a great teammate, how to build your brand, and how to build your legacy off the court as well,” James said.“It’s bigger than just the game, it’s bigger than just the sport, it’s about living a life that makes people proud, makes your family proud, makes the people that came before you proud.”Full podcast:Thank you for being with us!

            "raw_content": "How LeBron James changed NBA this decade\n\nFrom the minute LeBron James decided in 2010 to play for the Heat, it was inevitable that nobody would have a bigger impact on the NBA in the following 10 years.\n\nJames, now playing for the Lakers, won championships, MVPs, a gold medal, dominated the Eastern Conference and became a fixture in the NBA Finals in the decade.\n\nHe empowered players, spoke out on basketball and non-basketball issues, created avenues to expand his brand and business in Hollywood and turned his charitable work into meaningful projects that will continue to have an impact long after James is finished playing basketball.\n\nFor all of this and more, James has been voted the athlete of the decade by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHere are five of the ways in which James changed the NBA in the 2010s:\n\nFinals and titles\n\nJames played in eight consecutive Finals, joining a handful of Celtics from the 1950s and 1960s as the only players to accomplish that feat. He won three titles (2012, 2013 and 2016) and delivered memorable performances: a triple-double in a Game 7 victory over Golden State in which the Cavs came back from a 3-1 series deficit, an overtime triple-double in Game 6 against San Antonio to save the Heat from elimination and a 37-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 against the Spurs to clinch a title. He won three Finals MVPs, two regular-season MVPs, a gold medal in 2012 and prevented several teams – Chicago, Indiana, Boston, Atlanta and Toronto – from reaching the Finals. All five of those teams changed coaches after failing to beat James in the playoffs. When he want to Los Angeles, the East exhaled.\n\nBig 3/player empowerment movement\n\nJames pioneered modern-day player empowerment, starting with his decision to form a Big 3 in Miami with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Players play with whom they want and where they want even if that means forcing their way via trade. At the time, James’ move was criticized, but it’s commonplace now and other teams view it as a way to build a championship contender. When James went back to Cleveland in 2014, he joined Kyrie Irving, and the Cavaliers traded for Kevin Love. It happened more organically with Golden State’s Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, but the Warriors still added Kevin Durant in 2016. Last summer, Kawhi Leonard teamed up with Paul George with the Clippers, a move Leonard wouldn’t have made had George not been traded to the Clippers, and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant decided to join up with Brooklyn.\n\nMastery of media\n\nJames hasn’t always been perfect – his much-maligned “The Decision” announcement on ESPN in 2010 being his biggest gaffe. But since then, James has mastered the media landscape, knowing how to use social media, traditional media and his own platform “Uninterrupted” to spread his message. His entertainment company, SpringHill Entertainment, has worked with TV and movie studios to create shows, including \"The Shop\" on HBO and \"Space Jam 2\" with Warner Bros. Today, almost every NBA star uses a form of alternative media (YouTube, Instagram, The Players Tribune) to deliver content to consumers or join large companies on multimedia projects. Durant is an executive producer on ESPN’s \"The Boardroom,\" has a YouTube channel and interacts on Twitter. Curry is developing comedies for TV and the big screen.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nAthletes have been involved in philanthropy long before James, but he took it to another level with his LeBron James Family Foundation. Starting out as a charitable organization that provided free bikes to students who accomplished educational goals, the foundation has grown into something larger than James could’ve even imagined a decade ago. His first major initiative was creating a program in which students who met academic standards would receive free tuition to the University of Akron. His biggest achievement is the I Promise School, a public elementary school for at-risk students in Akron. It opened in 2018 and will continue to grow until it houses grades 3-8 by 2022. James needed basketball to make this happen, but this is much more significant than the game.\n\nSocial and political issues\n\nThe NBA has a history of addressing social issues, dating to the civil rights movement. But there was a bit of a lull in player activism through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. But then Trayvon Martin was killed in 2012 in Florida, and James and his Heat teammates wore hoodies for a photo with James tweeting the #WeAreTrayvonMartin hashtag. It marked the beginning of a new era of social and political activism for the NBA. Derrick Rose wore an “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirt during pregame warm-ups in support of Eric Garner, an unarmed man who died after an incident with New York police. James also wore one of those shirts and has criticized President Donald Trump on several occasions. With his voice so prominent, his missteps are amplified such as his comments that came off as pro-China just before the start of this season. Even with that, James’ willingness to speak out has helped other athletes do the same.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "ByGlenn Llopis\n\n\n\n4 Transformational Things LeBron James Teaches Us About Leadership And Teamwork\n\nByGlenn Llopis,\n\nContributor.\n\nLeBron James\n\nYou cannot go at leadership alone.  Great teams prevail when they grow and evolve together.\n\nIt’s hard to understand what this really means, until you are put in a position to deliver upon what this entails. For basketball fans, the recent narrative has been that the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the 2018 NBA Finals because LeBron James willed his supreme talents through a supporting cast of mediocrity. But if you know a thing or two about leadership, this is not what has happened.  LeBron James actually willed his leadership through a group of different, yet like-minded teammates that equally wanted to will their ways toward winning a championship.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned their right to the 2018 NBA Finals through the following 4 transformational things LeBron James has taught us all about leadership and teamwork:\n\n1. Spacing and Alignment\n\nWe often refer to spacing on the basketball court as the space that is required to run certain offensive and defensive plays by ensuring that your teammates are in the right spots to successfully execute upon those plays.  This concept of spacing is crucial to leadership success and the effectiveness of high-performance teams – as is requires leaders to give their employees the space to cultivate their ideas and share their ideals with and through others.  Spacing enables leaders and teams to explore endless possibilities centered on their own individual strengths and capabilities.  Spacing is about creating an environment that allows people the room to live with an entrepreneurial spirit – one that focuses on investing in relationships and trusting the value of those relationships that have been intimately cultivated to connect the dots of potential that don’t yet exist into previously unseen opportunities of momentum.\n\nLeBron James is a master at connecting the dots that don’t yet exist. He intimately understands how all of the pieces (teammates) of the puzzle (required solution) work together – with the wisdom to know that the puzzle can change at any time, while the pieces remain the same.  This is the power of creating optimal alignment between leaders and their teams – enabled by the right amount of spacing.\n\n2. Self-Trust and Situational Awareness\n\nThroughout the playoffs, another narrative that has played out is LeBron’s photographic memory, because of his ability to replay in his mind and flawlessly articulate to the media a sequence of plays or happenings that had taken place throughout a game that led to the team’s success or failures.\n\nGreat leaders are constantly replaying in their minds the success factors required to strengthen their situational awareness – especially when the stakes are high and adverse circumstances are overwhelmingly apparent.  During times of tremendous change and transformation this is especially important when you consider that not every leader or every teammate is prepared when circumstances force their hand.  As such, you must train your mind to anticipate the unexpected and this demands a level of courageousness that grows over time by having been exposed to difference circumstances and experiences that allows you to strengthen your mental muscle to elevate confidence into self-trust.\n\nThis is how self-trust is born and is cultivated throughout the span of one’s life and career.  Self-trust is the single most powerful force to strengthen one’s situational awareness as a leader, it gives you the clarity and understanding to know your team and teammates capabilities and what you can and cannot expect from them.\n\nIn 2009, I shared the following wisdom that my father shared with me in my book, Earning Serendipity:  “The wise man forfeits his fortune when he does not trust himself.”  Throughout his 15 year NBA career, LeBron has grown wiser and has learned how to trust himself.  It’s not by chance that he has played his best basketball during his later years.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Lebron James' Off-Court Hustles\n\n\n\n3. Patience and Reinvention\n\nSpeaking of being wiser, wisdom teaches us the importance of patience.  In today’s rapid-paced workplace, patience has become lost in the demands for the immediacy of results.  As such, we rarely appreciate the methods that led to earned success.  One of LeBron James’ most understated skills on the court is the ability to be patient.  Having been crowned “King James,” basketball fans and historians alike expect and demand results (championships) from LeBron.  The pressure to deliver upon these expectations can be overwhelming.  LeBron James has done what most players fail to do enough: continuously reinvent his game (much like Tiger Woods did during his prime).\n\nLeBron constantly refers to taking care of his body and his mind.  While most believe that his pure athleticism and size (6 ft., 8 inches; 280 pounds) is his differentiator, it’s actually what he has done to fuel his mind that has defined his real competitive advantage.  My father used to tell me, “When you fuel your mind with meaningful knowledge each day, it will continue to grow stronger.  When you put it to the test, it will grow wiser.”  LeBron James has conditioned his mind to neutralize external pressure and not allow adversity to disrupt his mindset and ability to perform.  His preparation methods off the court has led to his on the court greatness.\n\nIt has become equally important to be mentally and physically prepared to be a great leader.  Patience and reinvention are crucial to your short and long-term leadership success and your ability to allow your team(s) to create significant outcomes.  Never stop refining your methods.\n\n4. Inclusion and Individuality\n\nLeBron James knows who he is.  When you hear him speak about his teammates, he also knows who they intimately are (there capabilities, their circumstances, their personal and professional history, etc.).  LeBron knows that leadership demands that we reacquaint ourselves with our people.  And when there is employee turnover during times of transformation, you need to take ownership to be part of the solution – not the problem.  LeBron has taught us all that building high-performance leaders and teams demand that we focus on inclusion and the power of individuality.   In other words, you don’t have to spend the most money on talent, nor recruit talent with the best experience, to create winning teams.  You just need to focus more intently on knowing the talent you are recruiting, how they can specifically contribute to building a system that utilizes each individual’s assets for the betterment of the team’s overall success and the organization’s healthier whole.  This approach makes everyone’s success more sustainable.\n\nThis is what the Cleveland Cavaliers did in 2018 when they transformed their roster to give their team a chance to compete for a fourth consecutive NBA finals appearance.  Most would have thought that a fourth consecutive return to The Finals would have been impossible.  But it was through the collaboration of its front office executives and LeBron James’ leadership capabilities (on and off the court) – that the Cleveland Cavaliers created a powerful growth strategy through inclusion and individuality.  Regardless of LeBron’s supreme capabilities, his strengths would not have been as apparent on the court – if each individual was not fully activated and deployed as one cohesive unit.\n\nToday’s leaders must embrace the power of individuality and inclusion.  The speed of change and transformation demands it. Enterprise leadership must stop defining the individual.  This only leads us all down a path of playing not to lose – where complacency ensues.  Leadership in the 21st century is about allowing the individual to influence more and giving them the room to be more inclusive (regardless of hierarchy or rank).  This renewed mindset leads us all down a path of playing to win because the individual desires to be significant for the betterment of a healthier whole.\n\nDeploy your own LeBron James style of leadership that embraces inclusion and recognizes the power of individuality because that’s when possibilities for growth and transformation are unlimited.\n\n\n\n"

While LeBron has certainly carved out an all-time great career, a closer examination of statistics, competition, mental toughness, and impact on the game solidifies Jordan’s place as the undisputed GOAT. Here’s why.\n\n1. Dominance in the Finals: Jordan’s Championship Pedigree\n\nThe clearest distinction between Michael Jordan and LeBron James is in their NBA Finals performances. Let’s break down their records:\n\nPlayer | Finals Record | Championships Won | Finals MVPs\nMichael Jordan | 6-0 | 6 | 6\nLeBron James | 4-6 | 4 | 4\nJordan has never lost in the NBA Finals, a perfect 6-0 record, which is unheard of in modern basketball.\n\nLeBron has appeared in 10 Finals but has lost six times, often criticized for struggling in key moments (2011 Finals vs. Mavericks being a prime example).\n\nJordan won Finals MVP every time he played in the Finals, showing that he was the primary driver of Chicago’s championships.\n\nThe ability to close the deal and win championships without a single defeat is a major separator in the GOAT debate.\n\n2. Statistical Breakdown: Scoring, Efficiency, and Defense\n\nLet’s compare Jordan and LeBron across key statistical categories:\n\nPlayer | PPG | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | FG% | FT%\nMichael Jordan | 30.1 | 6.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 0.8 | 49.7 | 83.5\nLeBron James | 27.1 | 7.5 | 7.3 | 1.5 | 0.9 | 50.5 | 73.4\nKey takeaways:\n\nScoring Dominance: Jordan’s 30.1 PPG is the highest career average in NBA history.\n\nEfficiency in Closing Games: Jordan was a superior free-throw shooter (83.5% vs. LeBron’s 73.4%), meaning he was more reliable in crunch time.\n\nDefense: Jordan was an elite perimeter defender, winning Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) in 1988, while LeBron never won this award.\n\nPassing & Rebounding: LeBron edges Jordan in assists and rebounds, but his style of play as a forward necessitates higher numbers here.\n\nOverall, Jordan’s ability to dominate both ends of the court makes him a more complete player.\n\nDid you know that the Jersey Mount is the only Jersey Hanger on the market that can be mounted to any surface type including the ceiling!

Competition Level: Stronger Era for Jordan?\n\nCritics of LeBron often point out that his era has seen a talent dilution due to expansion teams and weaker defensive rules.\n\nJordan played against Hall of Fame big men like Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, and David Robinson. The physicality of 80s and 90s basketball made scoring harder.\n\nLeBron has played in an era of wide-open, three-point heavy basketball where defenders have fewer tools to stop offensive players due to rule changes.\n\nThe Eastern Conference, where LeBron dominated, was significantly weaker compared to Jordan’s time when teams like the Bad Boy Pistons, Knicks, Pacers, and Celtics were all powerhouse defensive squads.\n\n4. GOAT Mentality: Clutch Factor and Competitive Edge\n\nA major argument for Jordan being the GOAT is his killer instinct and competitiveness:\n\nGame-Winners: Jordan made 25 game-winning shots in his career, many coming in the playoffs (e.g., “The Shot” over Craig Ehlo, 1998 Finals dagger vs. Utah).\n\nNo Weak Mental Moments: Jordan never disappeared in crucial moments, whereas LeBron had major letdowns (2011 Finals vs. Dallas, 2014 vs. Spurs).\n\nRelentless Work Ethic: Jordan’s dedication to improvement and his ruthless approach to competition (famously pushing teammates in practice) is unparalleled.\n\nLeBron has had impressive clutch moments, but he has also been criticized for passing up last shots and playing passively in key games.\n\n5. Cultural Impact and Global Influence\n\nJordan transcended basketball in ways LeBron hasn’t:\n\nAir Jordan Brand: The Jordan Brand still dominates global sneaker sales decades after his retirement.\n\nIconic Moments: His presence in pop culture, from Space Jam to the NBA logo speculation, cements his legacy.\n\nOlympic Dream Team: The 1992 Dream Team, led by Jordan, globalized the NBA in ways never seen before.\n\nRespect from Peers: Players from Kobe Bryant to Kevin Durant have modeled their mentality after Jordan, proving his enduring influence.\n\nLeBron’s activism and social impact are commendable, but Jordan’s legacy remains untouchable when it comes to influence on the game.\n\nFinal Verdict: The GOAT Title Belongs to Jordan\n\nWhile LeBron James is undoubtedly one of the greatest players of all time, when analyzed through championship success, statistics, competition, mentality, and impact, Michael Jordan remains the GOAT.\n\n6-0 Finals Record vs. 4-6\n\n30.1 PPG Career Scoring Average\n\nDefensive Dominance (DPOY, steals leader)\n\nUnmatched Clutch Factor\n\nGlobal Icon Beyond Basketball\n\nFor those who watched Jordan dominate in real time, his aura of invincibility, competitive fire, and ability to rise in the biggest moments set him apart from any other player. LeBron may be a more versatile all-around player, but Jordan was simply built differently—a true assassin on the court.\n\nMichael Jordan is, and always will be, the GOAT.\n\nLeBron vs. Stephen A.

While Lebron still has many more chapters to write for his legacy, the Jordan legacy is one of if not the greatest athletic legacy of all time. While these analysts will throw out statistics and try to analytically compare these two icons, Jordan’s legacy goes beyond the basketball court. While this debate will probably never end here are five reasons why Michael Jordan’s legacy is greater than Lebron James will be.\n\n5) College glory\n\nUnlike Lebron, Jordan has a National Championship on his legacy\n\nThis one is a quick and one-sided debate. Since Lebron James never attended college he never had the chance to leave a legacy on college basketball. However, Jordan did. As a freshman, he made the winning shot against Georgetown to win the National Championship in 1982. With Jordan, the Tar Heels helped to build one of the best programs in college basketball which continues today. While Lebron supporters will say that it is more impressive to go from high school to the NBA, Jordan had one of the greatest college basketball careers and has added bonus points to his resume. Only a handful of players have made such an impact in both the NCAA and the NBA, and Jordan is one of them.\n\n4) Hometown Hero\n\n“The Decision” will always be a negative aspect of James’ career\n\nWhy is Lebron James hated so much? Well when you embarrass your hometown on national television people will tend to think you’re a jerk.  “The Decision”  which aired on June 8, 2o10 on ESPN is one decision that Lebron James wishes he could change. Not necessarily joining the Heat, but how he handled the whole situation. Instead of just having it announced like any other athlete, he decided to torture the Cleveland faithful even more by giving them just a glimmer of hope that he’d return only to take it away in an instant. Also it doesn’t help when you say that you made the decision that morning. Doesn’t look like you put that much effort into it. Personally I don’t think that going to the Heat instead of playing Cleveland should hurt Lebron’s legacy. However, Jordan did stay with one team and did win for the hometown team instead of leaving. For me though I think just how he handled the decision and turn it into a publicity stunt will hurt his legacy more in the long-run then actually leaving Cleveland.\n\n3) Jordan’s impressive 6-0\n\nJordan’s perfect tile record is one thing James will never be able to accomplish\n\nIf Michael Jordan was a movie he’d be known as The Lord of the Rings. While he may not have the most rings, there is no question that his perfect NBA title record is unmatched. While you could possibly beat Jordan any other time of the year, when the lights where brightest and it was the final minute of the season, you had no chance. Jordan was clutch, and being able to go to six championships and win six rings in an amazing accomplishment. Heck if Jordan didn’t take off to play baseball he could have probably added another ring or two to his trophy case. Unfortunately for James, his 1 for 3 NBA finals record makes this is an easy win for Jordan. Even if James can pull out a title this season he’ll only would have won 50% of his NBA title shots. Sorry Lebron, Jordan’s got you beat here.\n\n2) His Royal Airness\n\nJordan is just as big of a winner off the court as on the court.\n\nJordans. Just saying that jars up the jump man image on the side of a sweet pair of sneakers. The “Air Jordan” brand has become a world-wide icon and cements Micheal Jordan as the most marketable athlete in history. James doesn’t have his own brand and will probably never come close to establishing a brand like Jordan has. Beyond the Jordan brand, while James will probably make more money off of endorsements then Jordan, his airness did create the market for modern-day stars. Jordan was a trailblazer for sports marketing and has allowed for athletes to get the endorsements they do to this day. Jordan’s impact is incredible when you realize how he’s become integrated into modern-day culture. Even today he is still a marketing juggernaut even after stepping off the hardwood more than a decade ago. Think about it Jordans, McDonald’s, Hanes, Gatorade, Coca Cola, Ball Park Franks, Wheaties and Chevrolet. Chances are you still have a favorite MJ commercial you remember and that you’ve seen all of his commercials from these brands. As for James, his only commercials are with Nike and his most memorable one is when he had this pity party commercial because people now looked at him as the villain. Sorry James MJ wins with impact, volume, variety, and doesn’t whine when it comes to his commercials. Also the man played with Bug Bunny in Space Jam! Seriously every kid I know has seen that movie. Have you played basketball with a world-famous cartoon character? Nope didn’t think so Lebron.  Click here for a trip down memory lane.\n\n1 ) Coming through in the clutch\n\nNow one was a better closer then 23\n\nGame 7, clock about to expire, your team needs a basket who do you give the ball to? I’m betting that if you could choose any player to take the winning shot, it would be Jordan. This basket at the end of the 99 Finals is one of those moments when Jordan came through in the clutch. In the face of adversity Jordan always seemed to come up big. Whether it was game winning shots, dunks, or being able to overcome the flu (click here), Jordan’s career was filled with coming through in the biggest moments. James, on the other hand, has come up short in big spots. Sure he had the game winner against the Pacers this year, but other than the game winner in Cleveland a few years ago what has he done? Not only has Jordan created more clutch moments but, but he’s done it on the biggest stage in the finals. Has Lebron made any memorable plays in the finals? Jordan has, heck you could have a highlight show of all his memorable moments in the finals. In the end there is no question that when you want a game winning basket, you’re giving the rock to Jordan.\n\nWhile I still find it difficult to pick between these two players, they’re both very different players in very different eras, in the end of the Jordan versus James debate it is clear that Jordan is the clear winner. Sure Lebron could break his scoring records and even title wins, but at the end of the day no player had a greater impact on the game of basketball then Michael Jordan. While statistically both these men are very close, and you could argue Lebron is superior, when you combine all of the other factors MJ is the clear victor. No athlete has had such an impact both on and off the court as Jordan has. While Lebron may truly end up being the king, there is no question that Jordan will always be the greatest.\n\nShare this:\n\nRelated\n\nPost navigation\n\nOne thought on “Why Michael Jordan’s legacy is already greater than Lebron James”\n\nPingback: Can they be stopped?

From my perspective, I believe no other basketball player has dominated at the same level that James has had for this longevity. However, with this said, I am also a person who respects others’ opinions and am curious to understand their reasoning behind who they believe is the G.O.A.T. For example, if you believe Player X is the greatest, I will not attempt to change your mind since that is your opinion.\n\nMany people have their opinions on who the G.O.A.T is whether it be Kareem, Wilt, Bill Russell, etc. However, for the most part, many believe that either LeBron James or Michael Jordan is the G.O.A.T. I will focus on those two but not dive deep on what the two have accomplished nor their stats nor their impact. Instead, I will look at the one argument that people love to use in this debate and how it, to an extent, nettles me. That argument, of course, is the 6–0 argument.\n\nIt is a known fact that Michael Jordan went an impressive 6–0 in the NBA Finals through his 15-year career. Meanwhile, LeBron James has gone 4–6 in the finals through year 17. While these are both legendary accomplishments, some people try to penalize LeBron for accomplishing this as if it was bad to make the finals.\n\nHere’s what I mean; some people try to degrade LeBron’s legacy by citing how he was a “loser” in the finals while MJ was a “winner.” Now some people will say “How many times has MJ played the Warriors?” but to be honest it’s not even that. It’s the fact that people are trying to punish LeBron for making it to the finals for basically this past decade. Seriously, I don’t understand this narrative.\n\nThese same people say that LeBron cannot even approach Jordan because of his losing record. Well, the fact of the matter is that Michael Jordan failed to make an NBA final till his SEVENTH season. Meanwhile, LeBron James made the Finals in his FOURTH season. Now I can already see how people are saying, “LeBron didn’t make the playoffs his first two seasons” but Jordan also didn’t make the playoffs in Washington. I mean at the end of the day, it is the greatest basketball career of all time not the greatest six years of all time so longevity matters. Plus, that was Jordan’s 15th season where he wasn’t winning games while this is LeBron’s 17th season where he has won a title.\n\nSimply put, I don’t understand how LeBron losing finals can hurt his legacy. In any way, it should be helping his legacy since making the finals is an accomplishment in itself. I mean the NBA awards both finals participants a trophy for their hard work. Imagine going to Tokyo next year; Would you rather win six gold medals or four gold and six silver medals?\n\nThe whole 6–0 Jordan argument has got to stop. Bluntly put, the 6–0 notion is not something which people should be using when comparing Jordan to others.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n4\n\nPublished in Top Level Sports\n\nVariety sports publication featuring opinions, analysis, and more\n\nWritten by Nibodh Vallapureddy\n\nFootball | Basketball | Market Enthusiast | Writer | Thinker |\n\nResponses (4)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

James was incredible against the Warriors, posting back-to-back 41-point games when Cleveland was facing elimination, then recording a triple double in an epic Game 7.\n\nJames is now 3â4 in the Finals, with performances ranging from meltdown to miraculous. How does James's 2016 series stack up with the rest of Finals appearances? Weâve ranked all seven of them below:\n\nâ¢Â Get SIâs Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Championship package\n\n7. 2011 Finals\n\nâ17.8 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game\n\nLeBronâs first Finals with the Heat was easily the worst of his career. James struggled against the Mavericks, who flummoxed him with a zone defense and an uncanny ability to keep him out of the paint. The series was catnip for his critics, who could point to LeBronâsÂ fourth-quarter stats as evidence of his inability to perform in the clutch. He was shockingly passive at times in the series, refusing to take J.J. BareaÂ into the post and failing to dominate his matchups defensively. Of course, the series likely set the stage for Jamesâs return to form and was the beginning of his biblical arc in Miami.Â\n\n6. 2007 Finals\n\nâ22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG\n\nA young James was no match for the veteran Spurs in 2007. The Cavaliers were swept, with Gregg PopovichÂ daring LeBron to shoot from the outside for much of the series. With space on the perimeter, James couldnât capitalize with his inconsistent shot. To Cleveland's credit, this series was close over the final couple games. After the sweep, Tim Duncan told LeBron that James would soon be the face of the NBA. Little did Duncan know he and LeBron would still have epic battles to come.\n\n5. 2014 Finals\n\nâ28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG\n\nThe Heat were outclassed by the Spurs in 2014, but by no stretch was LeBron to blame. People may remember the cramps from Game 1, but LeBron was outstanding during this series. He was failed by his teammates, with a limpingÂ Dwyane Wade often barely in the frame on defense and Chris Bosh struggling against San Antonioâs frontcourt. James was extremely efficient against the Spursâ defense, a testament to how much his jumper had improved since his first go-around with PopovichÂ seven years earlier. James shot 57.1% from the field and nearly 52% from three, and the series was ultimately an injustice to his performance.Â\n\nâ¢Â LeBronÂ James: âIâm coming home to Clevelandâ\n\n4. 2013 Finals\n\nâ25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG\n\nThere were so many huge LeBron moments from this series. His emphatic block of Tiago Splitter in Game 2. A Batman-and-Batman game from James and Wade in Game 4. And a clutch jumperâhis MJ momentâto clinch Game 7. But letâs talk about Game 6. People love to say LeBron was saved by Ray Allenâs three pointer. This is a horrible opinion. James was unreal on that unforgettable night. Remember when he lost his headband and seemingly found a new level of power? James left every single thing he had on the floor in that game, posting more than 30 points and a triple double to help save the Heatâs season. This was LeBron at his finest. He was everywhere on the court defensively. He anchored lineups in which he was surrounded by four shooters, lifting Miami to new heights offensively. He did everything and more that had been asked of him, and James is more responsible than Allen when it comes to protecting his legacy.\n\nOh, and James was equally special in the closeout, scoring 37 to seal the deal on his second straight championship.\n\nLeBron James Off the Court\n\nAnd so it begins....\n\nLebron went with a stuffed elephant over a basketball for this portrait.\n\nA high-school aged LeBron poses during a Field of Dreams-inspired photo shoot in 2002.\n\nJames didn't always boast a 250-pound frame, but has always been an intimidating presence, having averaged 21 points per game as a freshman in high school.\n\nSt. Vincent-St. Mary games were often broadcast on national television and played in college arenas during James' time with the Irish.

Smith looks on before Ohio State's game against Michigan at the Horseshoe in 2016.\n\n3. 2012 Finals\n\nâ28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG\n\nJames completed his transformation from villain to heroâa feeling only he and Ye knowâwith a dominant series in the 2012 Finals. This was the only Finals of LeBronâs career in which it felt like he had a direct rival: Kevin Durant. James took the challenge. He outplayed his counterpart offensively and defended Durant during the gameâs key moments. James exhibited a hunger in this series that could only emerge after years of heartbreak. There was a memorable moment in the fifth and final game of the series when LeBronÂ grabbed a rebound over three defenders, missed a shot, got his own rebound, then made a layup while being fouled. The play was a perfect example of Jamesâs physical dominance and refusal to be contained. With a triple double in the closeout game, James ensured his legacy would be one of a championship winner.Â\n\nâ¢ LeBron wins Finals MVP | Best highlights from Game 7\n\n2. 2015 Finals\n\nâ35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG\n\nIn an underdog role without his best teammate, Kyrie Irving, James put the Cavaliers on his back in the 2015 Finals. His efficiency dropped as his counting stats rose, but James single-handedly managed to slow down the team that had been running roughshod through the NBA. Jamesâs performance wasnât enough to lead his team to a win, but it should have been worthy of the Finals MVP award. James slowed the game down against Golden State in 2015, often pounding the ball before going 1-on-5 at the end of the shot clock. Even when everyone in the world knew what was coming, James managed to pour in buckets while scrambling all over the place on defense. The look of exhaustion on Jamesâs face by the end of the series was more than well earned.Â\n\n1. 2016 Finals\n\n29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG\n\nAfter two years of Stephen Curry hype, James reclaimed his status as the best player in the NBA with an incredible Finals performance. Curry had earned all the accolades usually reserved for James during the regular season, as he was crowned (by many) the leagueâs best player and earned the NBAâs first unanimous MVP selection. But James thoroughly outplayed Curry for most of the Finals, and personally reminded Curry who the NBAâs top dog was with a degrading swatâand hilarious smirkâduring Game 6. LeBron went up against all odds in this seriesâdown 3â1 entering Game 5, going against the winningest regular season team in NBA historyâbut showed that he himself could serve as an equalizer in the face of so many narratives. Jamesâs back-to-back 40-point explosions in Games 5 and 6 sent a message to every single fan of the NBA: When LeBron James is locked in, thereâs no one capable of stopping him.Â\n\nRohan Nadkarni covers the NBA for SI.com.
