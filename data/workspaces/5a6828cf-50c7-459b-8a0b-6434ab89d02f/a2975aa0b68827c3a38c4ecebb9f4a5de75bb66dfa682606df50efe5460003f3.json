The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead.[2] The three-point field goal was introduced in the NBA at the start of the 1979–80 season.[3][4] To qualify for the scoring title, a player must appear in at least 58 games (out of 82). However, a player who appears in fewer than 58 games may qualify as annual scoring leader if his point total would have given him the greatest average, had he appeared in 58 games.[5]  For the scoring title, this has been the requirement since the 2013–14 season, with requirements changing several times previously throughout history.[6]\n\nWilt Chamberlain holds the all-time records for total points scored (4,029) and points per game (50.4) in a season; both records were achieved in the 1961–62 season.[7] He also holds the rookie records for points per game when he averaged 37.6 points in the 1959–60 season.[7] Among active players, James Harden has the highest point total (2,818) and the highest scoring average (36.1) in a season; both were achieved in the 2018–19 season.\n\nMichael Jordan has won the most scoring titles, with 10.[8] Jordan and Chamberlain are the only players to have won seven consecutive scoring titles (this was also Chamberlain's career total).[8] George Gervin, Allen Iverson and Kevin Durant have won four scoring titles in their career,[9] and James Harden, George Mikan, Neil Johnston and Bob McAdoo have achieved it three times. Paul Arizin, Bob Pettit, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry and Joel Embiid have each won the scoring title twice. Since the 1946–47 season, five players have won both the scoring title and the NBA championship in the same season: Joe Fulks in 1947 with the Philadelphia Warriors, Mikan from 1949 to 1950 with the Minneapolis Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor)[g] in 1971 with the Milwaukee Bucks, Jordan from 1991 to 1993 and from 1996 to 1998 with the Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal in 2000 with the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][10] Since the introduction of the three-point field goal, O'Neal is the only scoring leader to not have made a three-pointer during the season.[11]\n\nAt 21 years and 197 days, Durant is the youngest scoring leader in NBA history,[12] averaging 30.1 points in the 2009–10 season. Stephen Curry led the league with an average of 30.1 points in the 2015–16 season and became the first player to win the title shooting 50–40–90 in a season. Russell Westbrook led the league with an average of 31.6 points in the 2016–17 season, when he also became the second NBA player to average a triple-double in a season. The most recent champion is Luka Dončić.\n\nKey\n\n^ | Denotes player who is still active in the NBA\n* | Inducted into theNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n§ | 1st time eligible for Hall of

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.
