He won six championships with the Bulls and led the team to two titles with three goals each. Jordan won his first championship in 1991 against Magic Johnson and the Lakers. That was followed by two consecutive titles in 1992 against the Blazers and 1993 against the Suns.\n\nChampionship rings have been part of the culture since the first NBA Finals in 1947. It’s amazing that Michael Jordan has won six such rings. The value of a championship ring remains priceless to those who receive it, as it is a souvenir of those who have worked hard to win the championship.\n\nYou can’t compare a ring won by an NBA legend like Michael Jordan to an average NBA player. Championship rings won by classic NBA teams, like the ones mentioned above, are expensive. If you buy or inherit an NBA championship ring from a legendary team like the Chicago Bulls of 1996, Boston Celtics of 1986, Lakers of 2001, or Lakers of 1987, you have a mini-bench in your closet. For example, the Herald Sun reported that a 1996 NBA championship ring from a member of the Bulls was for sale on eBay for $29,923. It is better if the team in question has performed excellently in the year in which they have won the championship.\n\nAs the league’s leading scorer and MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year never had enough of his lightness like Michael Jordan. He played the regular season to tell other players that he was better than them and that if they were in the upcoming playoffs, he would catch up with them. His only goal at any point was to focus on winning a ring at the end of the season.\n\nWinning the championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994-95 was a big deal. A ring can cost between $20,000 and $300,000. It really depends on who wears the ring. Hakeem Olajuwon had a championship ring, which was certainly a great start.\n\nI compared the constant value and relative value of the four players in the postseason to show that Michael Jordan is separating himself from the others, and the three that separate him from the six rings that matter.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA gold medal, the others being Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson. Russell’s 11 championships are the most of any player in NBA history.\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. He did the job at both ends of the floor, leading the Chicago Bulls to eight rings in six seasons, two of which were three-goal throws. Jordan dominated the NBA from the start, finishing with a perfect 6-0 record in the Finals, which is unlikely to happen again given the nature and dynamics of the league.\n\nBill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Shaquille O’Neal. Kareem, Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and Horace Grant had a season in which he scored 16.2 points per game in the postseason.\n\nA look at the Robin factor from year to year shows that Jordan has not benefited in any form or form from distorted seasons. His six rings make up six of the highest seven scores. He’s the only player you can’t argue with in the team.\n\nOnly four players in NBA history who haven’t played for Boston have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships during his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs. Seven of Russell’s teammates in Boston had seven or more championships. Including Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7).\n\nNo more than a handful of senior members of staff carry this rare distinction, in addition, of course, to the triumvirate of six-time champions Jordan, Pippen and Phil Jackson. Capp’s legacy is defined by his membership of the Bulls’ elite club, which has won six NBA championship titles and a complete set of club championship rings.\n\nIn fact, Jordan had six finals MVPs to the other two or two plays. As for Russell, in his first two championship teams and in his last, it was obvious he wasn’t even the second best player on the team. He was the youngest player on a team full of Hall of Famers and a veteran in his prime.\n\nThe steal and the shot, if you will, but my favorite moment of the game was the call from NBC’s Bob Costas. It’s one of the most iconic calls of all time. It was part of what made the legend of Michael Jordan so powerful. When the Bulls didn’t have the ball, you knew MJ was going to find a way to change that.\n\nDespite the fact that his doubters claimed he was just a regular-season player and would never be able to lead the Bulls into the ring, no one heard one. He was able to enjoy the taste of fame and he never looked back.\n\nAt 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls (13, 1984-93, 1995-98), the Washington Wizards and a few others in 2001-03. Jordan’s greatest years came with the Bulls in the 1990s, when he led them to six championships and as many finals appearances in eight years. He recorded a remarkable number for a player who was nearly 40 years old (35 when he was in the twilight of his career with the Wizards).\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in all 82 games. In the postseason, he averaged 30.7 points, 49 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals as the Bulls lost just one game en route to the finals. In the final, the Bulls jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and the SuperSonics. But the Sonics retaliated with two straight wins, and Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\nThe tip of the ring has a characteristic emblematic shape, embellished with the Bulls logo, a red stone with golden trims and horns in the middle and synthetic diamond and stone rivets on the face. The ring is engraved with 10K on the inside of Jostens Manufacturers.\n\nPlayers Name | Michael Jordan\nHow Many Rings | 6\nDrafted By | Chicago Bulls\nWon Rings With | 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\nPlayers College | North Carolina\nPlayers Birthday | February 17, 1963\nHometown | Brooklyn, New York\nYear Drafted | 1984\nRound Drafted | 1\nPick Drafted | 3\nRELATED RINGS\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n"

Breaking down his NBA Finals runs\n\nBill Bender\n\nHow many championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nESPN's 10-part documentary, \"The Last Dance,\" concludes Sunday, chronicling the Chicago Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s and detailing the franchise's NBA championship runs with Michael Jordan.\n\nThe focus is on Jordan, who pushed the Bulls to those championship runs.\n\nThe full clip from #LastDanceMichael Jordan on Leadership. pic.twitter.com/vsQJpCnhfK\n\nMORE: Michael Jordan's six championship Bulls teams, ranked\n\nHow many NBA championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nJordan led the Bulls to six NBA championships from 1991-98. The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007. He has covered the College Football Playoff, NBA Finals and World Series for SN. Bender enjoys story-telling, awesomely-bad 80s movies and coaching youth sports.\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\n"

All Jordan cared about was championships. He had this one goal, a single point focus to win a ring at the end of the season. He played the regular season in a way that let the other players know that he was so much better than the rest of them and that when the playoffs came he was no match for them. He dominated in the playoffs, went 6-0 in the NBA finals, and never had to see a 7th game winning 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls in a stretch of 8 seasons.\n\nPlayer Full Name | Michael Jeffrey Jordan\nDate of birth | February 17, 1963\nDrafted by | Chicago Bulls\nDrafted Year | 1984, Round 1, Pick 3\nRings Count | 6 rings\nRings Years | 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998\nWon Championships with | Chicago Bulls\nHow many rings does Michael Jordan have?\n\nMichael Jordan has won 6 rings in all with the Chicago Bulls.

While his scoring ability often steals the spotlight, his defensive prowess should not be overlooked. Jordan was a tenacious defender who earned numerous awards and accolades for his efforts on that end of the court.\n\nJordan’s defensive abilities were apparent from the start of his career. As a rookie in the 1984-85 season, he averaged 2.4 steals per game and continued to improve as a defender over the next few seasons.

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

However, by the 2022-23 season, we see a more even distribution of three-point attempts across positions, with centers and power forwards contributing more from beyond the arc. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shift suggests that the NBA is moving toward a model where \"shooting bigs\" are becoming more common, while point guards are not necessarily relied upon as primary three-point shooters.\n\n3-Pointers by Team\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nStatistical Increases: The Modern NBA’s Offensive Explosion\n\nAcross all three seasons, there has been a noticeable increase in points, assists, and rebounds, with three-pointers seeing the most significant rise. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis trend underscores the growing emphasis on the three-point shot as a primary offensive weapon. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in these statistics is a testament to the evolution of the game, where teams are not only scoring more but also relying heavily on the three-point line to do so.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nComparing Generational Talents: Jordan, Curry, Jokic, and Green\n\nThe Future of the NBA: What’s Next?\n\n"

The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.\n\nArticle Details\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nReferences\n\nAlsasua, R., Lapresa, D., Arana, J., Anguera, M.T., & Garzón, B.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. INTRODUCTION Basketball is one of the most practiced sports in the world (Quispe, 2023) and research has traditionally focused on aspects such as training, biomechanics, health and injuries, and physiology (Amirnordin et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Shi & Wu, 2024). However, technical-tactical studies, carried out from systematic observation, have not been sufficiently developed (Remmert, 2003) to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of increasingly sophisticated data analysis software, combined with the development of rigorous methodological approaches, provided researchers the tools to prove or disprove numerous theories about basketball that, until then, lacked scientific credibility. A particularly prominent area of the current research in the field of basketball is the relationship between physiological demands and the technical-tactical performance that players develop (Figueira et al, 2022). The depth and sophistication of these interactions, directly related to creativity and intra-team coordination (Furley & Memmert, 2015), confirm that basketball, along with its underlying structures, is a complex system (Klostermann et al., 2018). This complexity of the game generates complex data when studied, which, if simplified and decomposed into measurable units, becomes easier to analyse (Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In the case of basketball, this \"simplification\" is the only way to validate associations and/or causal relationships that occur during the game and obtain behavioural structures and interactions between them, from a certain distance, that does not affect their development. In this complex game, the whole, which means the team, is more than the sum of its parts, hence the importance of understanding how different players interact and relate to each other. One of the main data analysis techniques to analyse complex interactions in sports is polar coordinate analysis applied to data collected through systematic observation (Anguera & Hernández-Mendo, 2015; Castañer et al., 2016, 2017). Polar coordinate analysis can be used to measure the spontaneous behaviour of players interacting in their natural environment from the perspective of a specific behaviour, known as focal behaviour, having been performed with a high degree of success in other team sports such as soccer (Maneiro & Amatria, 2018) or handball (Navarro et al, 2018). In this sense, this typology of analysis has proven to be an effective tool to decompose the complexity of the game (Lago & Anguera, 2002; Castellano & Hernández-Mendo, 2003; Perea et al., 2012; Robles et al., 2013). Its application to the study of several of the best athletes in the world from various collective sports disciplines (Castañer et al., 2016; Castañer et al., 2017; Maneiro and Amatria, 2018) has allowed researchers to obtain practical conclusions about what makes these players excellent and, in return, make recommendations to improve the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. However, polar coordinate analysis has not yet been tested in players with a specific demarcation such as shooting guards. Most of the research on shooting guards is based on different groups of players based on their position in the field between this specific demarcation and point guards, obtaining interconnected results, which in no case can be confirmed as definitive for this type of demarcation, that is, the data analysed is generally outside the specific context of the actions and tactical technical performance developed by these players (Gómez et al, 2007; Sampaio et al., 2008). On the other hand, the relationships that occur between players are usually viewed through a prism focused on their traditional role according to their position on the field. However, in today's basketball, where greater versatility is increasingly required from players, only three key positions (guard, forward and centre) are identified, according to Sampaio et al. (2006), leaving the shooting guard position diluted and integrated in a non-specific way as such. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 109 This happens since the traditional mission of the shooting guard is characterized by their permeability, being a driving force that helps the point guards to organize the game and raise the ball, as well as having mastered shots at all distances (outside, inside and free throws), an aspect that conditions him to be the team's highest scorer and the player with the greatest responsibility attacking. This is why his identification as such is not defined, since he shares the functions of point guard and small forward. In this sense, Fransen et al. (2016), in their study on leadership in sport, determine that the players with main rolls in the game are in a very beneficial spatial position that, in combination with their high tactical responsibilities, positions them as team leaders. Following this line, there are many current examples of great international players that play this position such as Stephen Curry, Luca Doncic or James Hardem, who have as role models players like Kobe Bryant, who had at the same time Michael Jordan as an idol to emulate, latter considered the best shooting guard of all time (Greer, 2023). Given the above, it is considered appropriate to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the best shooting guards of all time in his natural environment. This will be carried out through the study of his interactions between teammates and his executed technique, aiming to unequivocally and scientifically establish the elements that must be present in players who play or wish to play in this position that is so relevant in basketball. Applying a robust methodological approach, combined with in-depth multidimensional analysis of rigorously coded data, will help provide objective insights into how Michael Jordan interacts with his environment and makes him unique. The specific objective is to analyse Michael Jordan's technical skills in the NBA playoff final of the 1995-1996 season through his technical actions, his shoots and his relationship with his teammates. METHOD To carry out the development of the present research, the Observational Methodology (Anguera, 1979) has been applied. The research design, in accordance with Sánchez-Algarra and Anguera (2013), follows an Idiographic model –given that a single team is the unit of study–, a Tracking model –studying during the games that constitute the finals of the 1995-1996 playoffs–, and a Multidimensional model –due to the categories that form the dimensions constituting the observation instrument. The conducted observation has been guided by scientific criteria with total perceptiveness and as a non-participating observer. Participants/Sample The observational sampling conducted has been intentional (Anguera, et al., 2011) with the American professional basketball team Chicago Bulls during the development of the playoff finals for the NBA Champion title in the 1995-1996 season (in this season, the Chicago Bulls won 72 games, breaking the all-time record for most victories in a season, a record that lasted for 20 years). The videos used are publicly available television broadcasts that have been retrieved for the study. All offensive sequences developed by the team during the 6 games that make up the finals of that season –1995-1996– have been coded. The 521 coded offensive sequences consist of 4798 multi-events. Intersessional consistency has been ensured through the following elements: the same ball size, the same court dimensions, the same game time, the same players on the roster, and the same jersey assignments. Observation instrument The present research required the development of an ad hoc observation instrument –see Table 1– which drew from the following sources: the works of Alsasua et al. (2018) and Arroyo et al. (2022). The instrument adapted their contributions and included new dimensions –Player Position, Defensive System, and Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 110 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. Consequence– which will provide a solid foundation for addressing the research objective. The instrument is a combination of nested category systems in field formats –dimensions. These categories adhere to the premise of being exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Table 1.

Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 111 Recording and coding The data was recorded (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2014) using Lince software, version 1.2.1 (Gabin et al., 2012), achieving an intra-observer agreement value of .91. The obtained data is of type IV, i.e., concurrent and time-based (Anguera et al., 2011). Subsequently, two additional programs were employed. The first one was Gseq v5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011), through which sequential analysis of delays was conducted. Later, the program Hoisan, version 1.2 (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2012), was utilized. The data obtained from the previous software was entered and analysed for obtaining polar coordinates. Finally, for the representation of results, the ObserTools application (Rodríguez-Medina et al., 2021) was employed. Data quality The data collection was carried out by two graduates in Sports Science with extensive experience in the studied sport and the use of observational methodology. However, the observers received specific training for data collection in this study following the phases recommended by Anguera (2003). The primary observer recorded all sequences comprising the observational sampling, while the second observer recorded 16.7% of the total sample. The reliability of the obtained data was calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between nominal classifications where there is no order of ranking. GSEQ software version 5.1 was used for the calculation of this coefficient following the recommendations established by Bakeman & Quera (2011). The concordance index achieved by the primary observer was .91 (intra-observer agreement). Regarding the result of inter-observer agreement, it was higher than .86 in all games included in the study (game 1 = .93; game 2 = .87; game 3 = .94; game 5 = .88, game 6 = .87). Considering these concordance data, it can be stated that the agreement is almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977). Data analysis Two types of data analysis have been employed to address the stated objectives: synchronous analysis and diachronic analysis. Synchronous analysis through inferential statistics has been used to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria, using the Pearson chi-square statistic (χ²). This was done by applying the following formula: χ2 = ∑ [(𝐹 𝑖𝑗−𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗)2 𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑘 𝑖,𝑗=1 The computation of this statistic was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0. Regarding the diachronic analysis, polar coordinates analysis has been employed, which is a very recent typology of analysis in sports science (Anguera and Hernández-Mendo, 2015). Cochran's Zsum (1954) is the foundation and origin of this analysis technique, which applies and is based on the principle that the sum of N independent z scores is normally distributed, with Z = 0 and s = N. Thus, the statistic 𝑍sum = ∑ 𝑧 √𝑛 𝑚 𝑙 (where n is the number of delays), according to Sackett (1980), allows measuring the strength or associative consistency between different behaviours. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 112 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. The polar coordinates technique, developed by Sackett (1980) and later refined by Anguera (1997), is utilized to identify the relationships between behaviours. The technique involves one of these behaviours: the conditioning behaviour or focal behaviour and the remaining behaviours, which constitute the various dimensions of the observation instrument (conditioned behaviours). This analysis is performed both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (-1 to -5), resulting in a vector for each behaviour related to the focal behaviour, with a specific angle and radius. Based on the angle obtained by the vector, it can occupy one of the four quadrants or sectors that make up the polar coordinate. Depending on the quadrant the vector occupies, the activation or inhibition relationship between behaviours varies. In quadrant I, the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. In quadrant II, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the retrospective plane, while it is not in the prospective plane. In quadrant III, the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour in both the prospective and retrospective planes. Lastly, in quadrant IV, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the prospective plane, while it is not in the retrospective plane. RESULTS During Jordan's participation in the 6 games that make up the sample, he interacts with the ball a total of 536 times out of the team's total of 2996 interventions, accounting for 17.89% of the actions in the offensive play where the ball goes through his hands. Regarding the technical actions executed by Michael Jordan, the obtained results indicate the presence of significant differences (χ² = 163006; p < .001). Standout actions include dribbling –Drib– with 35.9%, Free-throw shooting –Lan– (11.9%), and Dribble –Bot– (12.6%), percentages superior in all cases to the results achieved by his teammates. On the other hand, RP –reception and pass– and Pas –pass– actions present lower percentage results compared to the rest of the teammates with 34.0% and 2.7%, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

Notably, the actions of TEs –Static Shot– (31.9%) and TAtR –Backward Jump Shot– with 15.9% stand out in this regard. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 113 Effectiveness Regarding shooting effectiveness, i.e., the success of making or missing the shooting action, the results obtained, when comparing the performances of Michael Jordan with the rest of his teammates, show significant differences (χ² = 1615, p < .001) in favour of Michael Jordan, presenting much higher shooting efficiency percentages than the rest of his teammates –Table 4. Table 4. Shooting effectiveness. Ineffective Effective Other players 54.1% 45.9% Michael Jordan 48.8% 51.2% There are no significant differences in Jordan's involvement and the moment of the game, nor between the moment and the effectiveness of the shot, nor between the moment and the effectiveness between games. Finally, the results obtained are presented regarding the associative analysis through the use of polar coordinates technique, where Michael Jordan is related to the rest of the players in the squad who participated in the different games played. For the development of this analysis, the focal behaviour J23 has been related to the rest of the categories that make up the dimension (J33, J91, J13, J07, J09, J25, J34, J08, J22, J30, J00, J53, and J35), as well as with itself (J23). This analysis aims to verify the relationship established between Michael Jordan and the rest of the teammates throughout the final phase. The results obtained (Table 5 and Figure 1) show the criterion category J23 (Michael Jordan) with a radius of 7.24 and an angle of 45 degrees in quadrant I, where the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. Also, the categories J25 (Steve Kerr), J22 (John Salley), J00 (Randy Brown), J34 (Bill Wennington), and J30 (Jud Buechler) are observed with radii of 5.96, 3.69, 3.02, 3.33, and 2.96, and angles of 223.63°, 230.61°, 259.26°, 226.63°, and 238.32° respectively, in quadrant III, where the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. Figure 1. Representation of the behavioural map establishing category J23 as the focal behaviour in relation to his teammates in the 1996 finals matches. DISCUSSION Following Anguera and Hernández-Mendo (2015), the effectiveness of observational methodology lies in its ability to conduct a diachronic analysis with type II and type IV data, meaning data that include an order and a time component. However, conventional synchronic statistical analyses are also relevant, seeking associations between dimensions that provide categorical data to meet the objectives established in match analysis (O’Donoghue, 2009). Regarding the technical actions performed by Michael Jordan, dribbling stands out as the most prominent. This technical action is characteristic of shooting guards, who, unlike point guards, not only have offensive construction responsibilities, but also play a role in breaking the repetitive dynamics of the attack and are players with a high degree of technical proficiency (Okazaki et al., 2004; De Rose et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007). Regarding his shooting performance, Jordan demonstrates a particular expertise in free throw shooting, with a very high success rate. In this regard, this proficiency, coupled with his publicly acknowledged dedication to practicing this technique after daily training sessions, is closely linked to dribbling, as through these one-on-one situations, he manages to draw personal fouls in his favour, and these situations end up leading to free throw attempts, proving to be a decisive performance factor in basketball (Csataljay et al., 2009; Paulauskas et al., 2018). On the other hand, concerning the type of shot Jordan executes most notable, it is the fadeaway. This shooting style became his signature move, not only due to its repetition as the team's offensive finish but also because of his accuracy in scoring. This shooting technique serves as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned dribbling technique. Jordan uses dribbling as a deceptive move or feint to create optimal space, combined with the slight distance gained from the defender when jumping backward, allowing for a higher likelihood of successful execution (Courel-Ibañez et al., 2017). Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 115 In this regard, considering Jordan's shooting efficiency during the finals, especially if we take into account the volume and relevance of his shots, it can be observed the significance of this player in the team's scoring success. The precision in field goals is a crucial factor in achieving success in a game, as these variables represent both individual and collective offensive effectiveness (García et al., 2013; Malarranha et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, professional basketball has undergone significant development and evolution in the game over the last decade, showcasing players with increasingly versatile profiles (Courel-Ibáñez et al., 2017; Mateus et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to update knowledge about performance profiles in young players with professional potential and assess their suitability for today's high-level basketball (Ibáñez et al., 2018). However, it is crucial not to overlook the qualities and capabilities of players who have left their mark on the history of international basketball, particularly in the NBA, where players often exhibit a higher degree of specialization in their game compared to other competitions (Paulauskas et al., 2018). CONCLUSIONS The objective set in this research was to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan in the NBA 1995-1996 playoff finals through his technical actions, shooting, and his relationship with his teammates. To address this objective, two types of analyses, synchronous and diachronic, have been employed, through which, based on the results obtained, the following conclusions can be reached: - Regarding his actions, dribbling stands out, as well as the execution of free throws, which are strongly related elements. Here, Jordan demonstrates excellent ball control and 1x1 skills, forcing defences to engage with more than one opponent and causing defensive personal fouls. - The type of shot he performs that stands out is the fadeaway, a shooting action strongly linked to 1x1 situations. This provides a wide variety of resources and solutions to different 1x1 and even 1x2 scenarios for this player, making defending him a very complex situation due to the unpredictability of his actions. - Jordan is a completely consistent player with effectiveness indices in his actions and a level of participation that remains constant during all four quarters of each game and throughout the six games that make up the NBA finals. - The relationship between Jordan and his teammates does not show significant results exclusively with himself. This is interpreted as a player with great adaptability who both includes his teammates and is included by them in the plays, and the results clearly identify the team as rotation or non-participative. These types of studies allow us to advance and better understand the game of one of the best basketball players in the world. This enables the replication of his actions and a deeper comprehension and appreciation of the evolution of this sport. Similarly, this study serves as guidance for coaches and players in developmental categories, where the specificity of the position is less emphasized, and a more versatile player profile is increasingly valued, capable of effectively participating in the entire development of offensive actions.

Consider one such debate: who is the NBA’s greatest of all time (henceforth referred to as the GOAT)? While social isolation has stripped NBA fans of a thrilling regular season finish and leaves large what-ifs surrounding what would certainly have been the most compelling postseason in the better part of 10 years, it has amply fanned the flames of the old GOAT argument. With no new basketball to consume, I, like many fans, have allowed myself to be consumed by discussing the GOAT across various social media platforms, on FaceTime calls with siblings, or even in appropriately socially distanced activities.\n\nMany of these discussions have come about as a consequence of the riveting docu-series “The Last Dance” (focusing on the Chicago Bulls of the 1980s and ‘90s). Surely no NBA fan can watch the drama of these Bulls teams without being drawn into the GOAT conversation by their singular star, Michael Jeffrey Jordan. No discussion of the GOAT can be taken seriously without the consideration of Michael Jordan, the legendary shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls. Frankly, the GOAT debate begins and ends here for a large portion of NBA fans, and for good reason. Michael Jordan’s individual and team accomplishments literally fill books, and those accolades do not account for his cultural impact on basketball in the US and across the globe. Furthermore, his appeal and impact on a global level fail to do justice to the intensity of his individual preparation and competitive drive which inspired and elevated a generation of NBA All-Stars that followed in his footsteps.\n\nDespite all this, GOAT cases are made (legitimately) for players that came before and after Michael Jordan. Indeed, if the question was easily settled, there would be no debate. And yet, the debate rages on, with varying levels of rhetorical and analytical rigor but with all the fevered passion of a contest that has come down to the wire. The purpose of this report is to approach the GOAT conversation in a data-reinforced manner. I look beyond traditional box score metrics to quantify Michael Jordan’s case for the GOAT, though my own analytical biases will inevitably arise.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make the case for Michael Jordan as the NBA’s GOAT, beginning with a suitable data set is critical. In the case of MJ, I did not find it sensible to compare him to every NBA player that has ever played because (no disrespect) he would simply outshine most of them to an enormous extent. Moreover, the field of potential GOAT candidates has been whittled down over time to a relative handful of players (48 in the case of my data set) by people who form the NBA’s All-Decade teams. These teams are comprised of the greatest players in the 1980, ’90s, and so on until present. I considered only the All-Decade teams from the 1980s until the 2010s because 1) data and advanced statistics for previous players were inconsistently available, 2) the introduction of the 3-point line in 1979 skews scoring statistics from before this time period, and 3) Michael Jordan either played against or inspired the players on this list (often both).\n\nIn terms of the data set’s composition, I chose to shy away from traditional box score or “counting” statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) in favor of more “advanced” metrics. One of the issues with sports data is high levels of correlation between variables. For example, a player who scores a lot of points may also rebound a lot and have a high number of assists, all because they happen to be on the court for a large portion of the game. Having high correlation between your variables is like listening to a song with two guitarists: you may like the sound overall, but it is hard to tell which of the two guitarist is making “more” of the sound you like. Similarly, if we are trying to measure the impact of one variable or another, if they are highly correlated, we may not be able to tell which variable is the most impactful, which can lead to unreliable results when attempting to analyze the data.\n\nPart of the solution to this problem is to use advanced metrics, which are designed to combine and adjust more traditional measures to create measures that take some of the correlation problems out of a data set and also give more insight into a player’s impact on the game. Some of the advanced metrics included in this data set are described below (mostly paraphrased from basketball-reference.com’s excellent glossary):\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating — a combination of various counting statistics that essentially counts a player’s positive and negative statistical contributions, adjusts them for the pace of the game, and compares each individual to the league average in order to determine efficiency.\n\nUsage Rate — an estimate of the percentage of team’s plays that an individual player used.\n\nBox Plus/Minus — an estimate of how many points a player contributed above a league-average player on a league average team. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nWin Shares — an estimate that assigns a “share” of each team win to each player based on that player’s contribution to the win. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage — a measure of shooting efficiency based on shot type.\n\nFree Throw and Three Point Rates — these rates are measures of offensive efficiency, measuring and-1 free throws and the proportion of field goal attempts from three-point range.\n\nInitial Visualizations and Observations\n\nTo begin analyzing the data, I decided to take a look at plots that detail some of the attributes that make a player truly great. The first of these is a scatter plot comparing usage and efficiency, color coded by decade and sized by win shares. Why might usage and efficiency be an interesting comparison? Well, because there is generally a trade off between the two. Typically, a player that is used more is less efficient (think more turnovers, more missed shots, etc.). Conversely, a highly efficient player may appear more efficient because they are not used at a high rate. With that trade off scenario in mind, take a look at the following plot, comparing the usage and efficiency of the All-Decade teams:\n\nA few things stand out. First, with these GOAT candidates, there is hardly any evidence of a trade off between usage and efficiency. If anything, there is a positive correlation, meaning higher usage is related to higher efficiency. I take this as evidence of the greatness of all these players. Second, there is a noticeable difference in the distribution of players in some decades: those in the 1980s tended to be more in the lower left corner up through the center of the plot, while players in the 2010s seem to drift from center up toward the upper right corner. While there are several interpretations for this, I tend to think the emphasis on making the game “more” efficient in recent years can explain this trend. Despite that trend, however, the final point is the most striking to me: Michael Jordan is the most highly used and the most efficient of all the players in the data set and he has among the highest win shares to boot. If you were looking for one player that you could use again and again and again and still get efficient results at a historical level, look no further than MJ.\n\nThe next two charts are somewhat similar in that they look at a player’s impact on the defensive and offensive aspects of the game. I took win shares per 48 minutes and box plus/minus, broke them down into their offensive and defensive components, and plotted the players to show what end of the floor each player impacted the most.\n\nHere, the results match intuition to a large degree. Perennial defensive stalwarts like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are firmly in the high defense, low offense corner of the graphs, whereas prolific offensive players like Adrian Dantley and Steve Nash drift out more toward the high offense and low defense corner. Who occupies the coveted high offense, high defense corner, you ask? Who else? While David Robinson and LeBron James both edge into the realm, Jordan represents the pinnacle of a player who impacts the game at an elite level on both ends of the floor. Combine this with his best-in-class efficiency and usage rates, and his case for the GOAT solidifies.\n\nFactor Analysis — Drawing the GOAT with math\n\nDespite the evidence presented above, it is important to remember that those comparisons of usage versus efficiency and offensive versus defensive prowess are ones that I came up with, and therefore, they reflect my biases about what the GOAT should look like. Instead, factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) allows us the opportunity to mathematically determine a few “factors” (combinations of variables) that best describe the data set. In other words, factor analysis can be a way to check if our intuition about what factors are important in determining who the GOAT is. Running a factor analysis on this data set, we have the following three factors:\n\nThere are a few important things to break down here. First, the way to read the three factor columns is to look for the largest numbers in each column and see which variables they correspond with. Doing this, we might say that factor 1 emphasizes the importance of offensive efficiency, while factor 2 emphasizes defense, and factor 3 emphasizes usage. This reading of the factors somewhat reinforces my intuition of what attributes are important in determining the GOAT.\n\nSecond, the little red box at the bottom of the table indicates how much of the variation in the data set can be explained by the three factors above, about 65%. That means there is still about 35% of the differences between these players that cannot be explained by the data included in these factors. That is not surprising, and it is certainly a good reminder that these comparisons I shared should be taken with a grain of salt. However, there is at least some evidence that looking for an elite two-way player with high usage and high efficiency will get you on a suitable path for determining the GOAT.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these numbers and charts will do nothing to settle the debate over the GOAT once and for all, they certainly provide strong evidence for Michael Jordan. He occupies a nearly untouchable statistical echelon in terms of being a highly used and highly efficient player who dominates on both ends of the floor, even when compared to the best players from the last 40 years of NBA basketball. Doubtless, there are many ways to slice and dice this debate, but if anything, these findings make clear that any other competitor for GOAT is playing on MJ’s home court, and it’s his ball.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPublished in The Sports Scientist\n\nIn depth view of the world of Sports through the lens of Data Science, and Analytics\n\nWritten by Trevor Ram\n\nWriting about things I want to write about\n\nNo responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

It’s a topic that always sparks debate, so I figured I’d dig into the stats and the context to see what I could find. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a ride.\n\nFirst things first, I had to gather the data. I started by hitting up the usual suspects: Basketball-Reference, ESPN, *. I was looking for game logs, series results, player stats – the whole shebang. I spent a good chunk of the morning just sifting through all that information. Copy-pasting into a spreadsheet, you know the drill. It wasn’t pretty, but it had to be done.\n\nRelated posts\n\nWhat makes the Scoot Henderson shoe unique on the court?

This is where the fun really begins, right? Wrong! It’s tedious as heck. Removing duplicates, standardizing player names, making sure the dates lined up. Hours vanished into the abyss. But hey, garbage in, garbage out, so I powered through.\n\nNext, I wanted to understand the context of each Finals loss. It’s not enough to just look at the scores. Who were the opponents? Were there any major injuries? What was the team dynamic like? I dove into old articles, blog posts, even some YouTube highlights to get a better feel for what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nNow for the analysis. I looked at LeBron’s individual performance in those losses. Points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting percentages – the whole nine yards. I compared his stats to his regular season averages, and to his performance in winning Finals series. I was trying to see if there were any consistent patterns or differences.\n\nThen I shifted my focus to his teammates. How did they perform in those losing efforts? Were they stepping up, or were they struggling? I looked at their scoring, their defense, their overall contribution to the team. I was trying to figure out if LeBron was carrying the team, or if there were other factors at play.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t ignore the opposing teams. Who were the key players? What were their strengths and weaknesses? What was their game plan for stopping LeBron? I broke down their defensive strategies, their offensive schemes, and their overall team chemistry.\n\nAfter all that digging, I started to form some conclusions. It became clear that LeBron’s Finals losses weren’t always about him. Sometimes, he was just outmatched by a better team. Sometimes, his teammates didn’t provide enough support. And sometimes, it was just plain bad luck.\n\nI know some people will say that LeBron’s Finals record is a black mark on his legacy. But I think it’s important to remember that he’s faced some incredibly tough competition over the years. He’s gone up against some of the greatest players and teams in NBA history. And he’s always given it his all.\n\nSo yeah, that’s my journey through LeBron’s Finals losses. It was a lot of work, but I learned a ton. And hopefully, it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to win at the highest level.\n\nRuud vs Cerundolo Prediction: Key Stats and Insights\n\nAre you searching for the surreal crossword clue answer?

James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

Since 2011\n\nLebron James: In Defense of Six Finals Losses\n\nThough LeBron James has become synonymous with the NBA Finals, ever since left the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010, he has become the most criticized player in NBA history.  This criticism goes no farther than James’ 3-6 NBA Finals record.\n\nDefending LeBron James’ NBA Finals Losses\n\nLeBron James’ Three Finals Wins\n\nJames has been successful throughout his career, and winning three championships is no small feat. Two of these, 2013 and 2016, were both game seven wins where James played outstanding.  He has also been the finals Most Valuable Player every time. The highlight though was coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors, led by unanimous Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Six Finals Losses\n\n2007: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nLeBron’s 3-6 finals record is not very good, only winning one-in-three of his trips made to the NBA Finals. However, he has also had some of the worst luck in history. In his first appearance back in 2007, James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers at 23 years old.\n\nThe King would run into the San Antonio Spurs at their peak. The Cavaliers were low on experience, were not nearly matching the talent, and also were severely out-coached.  Nobody expected them to even make the finals, so James really overachieved this season.\n\n2011: Dallas Mavericks: 4, Miami Heat: 2\n\nOh, the “LeChoke” series. LeBron James averaged 18 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, and for him, that is terrible. There really is no defending James here specifically, but it is unfair that he catches all the flak.\n\nDirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks swept Kobe Bryant’s two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant, too, would not play very well. The Mavericks would also follow up that series by taking out Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook in five games.\n\n2014: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Miami Heat: 1\n\nThis series was one of the many James versus a super team series. Not only did he have to deal with the monstrous defense of Kawhi Leonard, but he would also face Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker. James led the series in points per game by ten points, averaging 28 points, eight rebounds, and four assists.\n\nJames had little help, as Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were both showing early signs of age and were struggling mightily this series. The Miami Heat had a thin bench, and the Spurs bench was maybe the best in the league. No Miami players performed well, and the Spurs were excellent outside of even their best players. James was outmatched and faced a double-team against multiple excellent defenders.\n\n2015: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 2\n\nThis was the first win of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, and the first season James returned to Cleveland. This series should have been won by Cleveland as they were better, but they were all injured. Before the playoffs, Brian Windhorst reported that LeBron James had five different injuries. James had already dealt with a lower back injury earlier in the season.\n\nObviously, the real reason that the Cavaliers did not come away with the title was the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Love suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Boston Celtics in the first round. Irving would fracture his kneecap in game one of the NBA Finals.\n\nJames would play like a monster, leading each team in every statistical category. He led every game in points scored except for game four and led the game in rebounds three out of the six games. James averaged 36 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for the series. This is a forgotten performance in the long biography of James’ NBA Finals appearances.\n\n2017: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 1\n\nRound three of the Cavaliers versus Warriors war was heavily favored to the Warriors. Golden State signed Kevin Durant on July 4th, 2016 after blowing a 3-1 lead to Cleveland a month prior.  This was viewed as a move that locked the Warriors in as 2017 champions. It was heavily believed that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green would walk through the season. This was correct, as they went 16-1 in the playoffs.\n\nJames, despite playing like a monster, was heavily outmatched. He averaged 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, but nothing he did could have been enough. The Warriors were too good, and there was not much to be done about it.\n\n2018: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nPrior to these finals, it is worth noting that many expected the Toronto Raptors to be the team to lose to the Warriors in 2018. James had one of the worst supporting casts in his career. He would lead the entire playoffs in both points and assists. James was the only player on the Cavaliers to score 20+ points in the first round but still won the series. The next round he would sweep the Raptors in the famous “LeBronto” series. James would single-handedly beat a very deep Celtics team, a team that was much better coached. Every team James and the Cavaliers faced were better than them, but James simply played the best basketball of his career.\n\nRound four, the conclusion of the Cavaliers versus Warriors finals, saw a clean sweep. Kyrie Irving was gone, the Warriors were the same, and James had no arsenal. This series’ highlight is George Hill missing a free throw with J.R. Smith thinking Cleveland was up one. James actually visibly called a timeout, but like usual, got no help from the referees. After this move, it looked like the end. James had dominated, but the overtime saw Golden State take over. When LeBron James scores 51 points while adding eight rebounds, and you lose, there is no hope.\n\nJames averaged 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists. The most impressive is the 10 assists though, as that means James’ teammates actually made more than 10 shots.  Basically, this was the worst supporting cast in memory. If James won this series, he would have been the undeniable GOAT.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nChris Gallagher\n\nShare:\n\nMore Posts\n\nMore Details Emerge Why Denver Dismissed Malone & What’s Next for The Nuggets?\n\nJust like when Memphis relieved Taylor Jenkins from his duties on March 8, there appeared to be an uproar or surprise at the Denver Nuggets\n\nHow Concerning is Jaylen Brown’s Injury?\n\nBoston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is currently dealing with a knee injury.

The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics (64–18) played the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls (72–10), with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The teams' 136 combined regular season wins shattered the previous record of 125, set in 1985 between the Los Angeles Lakers who won 62 games and the Boston Celtics who won 63 games in the past regular season. The series, the 50th NBA finals in league history, was played under a best-of-seven format. This was the first championship in the Chicago Bulls' second three-peat.[1]\n\nChicago won the series 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP, his fourth time winning the award.\n\nBackground\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls were coming off a season where they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Orlando Magic. Heading into the upcoming season, Chicago was no longer the same team as they were in their most recent championship season of 1993, having lost key members of their first three-peat core in John Paxson and Bill Cartwright who retired while  Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Will Perdue, and Scott Williams left via free agency.\n\nIn their place was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But perhaps their biggest addition to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran who had been a rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.\n\nThe result of this ensemble was perhaps the greatest regular season of any team in NBA history at the time, as the Bulls won a record-high 72 games, which would be broken by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015–16 season. They continued to gain momentum in the playoffs, beginning with a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round, followed by a five-game defeat of the New York Knicks in the second round. The conference finals was a rematch of the previous season's series with the Orlando Magic, but it was a no-contest, as the Bulls swept the Magic to gain entry into the Finals.\n\nSeattle SuperSonics\n\nThe SuperSonics were led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, with George Karl as head coach. The team was considered a perennial title contender throughout the mid-1990s, but the closest they came to reaching the finals was in 1993, when they lost to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nTwo straight first-round exits followed, including the stunning 1994 loss to the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets (the Sonics were the first seed in that playoffs). Motivated by a successive string of early playoff losses, Seattle finished the 1996 regular season with a franchise-record 64 wins.\n\nSeattle began its playoff run with a four-game win over the Sacramento Kings, followed by a dominant sweep of the defending champion Houston Rockets, headed by a 33-point win in Game 1 where they held Hakeem Olajuwon to 5 points. They then beat the Utah Jazz in seven games in the western finals to advance to its first NBA championship round since 1979.\n\nRoad to the Finals\n\nSeattle SuperSonics(Western Conferencechampion) |

offensively, they were able to compensate with superb defense. Frustration set in for Seattle when Frank Brickowski was ejected after committing a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman, then promptly getting charged with two consecutive technical fouls. Chicago was leading by only 2 at the end of the third quarter, but in the final quarter, shots by Toni Kukoč and 2 key steals by Ron Harper clinched the Bulls' Game 1 win. Shawn Kemp was a bright spot for Seattle, scoring 32 points, but ended up fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 28 points, while Scottie Pippen chipped in with 21 points. Seattle captain Nate McMillan ended up leaving the game due to a debilitating back injury in the 2nd quarter. Dennis Rodman pulled down 13 rebounds for the Bulls, while Toni Kukoč chipped in off the bench with 18 points.\n\nGame 2\n\nNBC\nJune 79:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics88,Chicago Bulls92\nScoring by quarter:27–23, 18–23, 20–30,23–16\nPts:Shawn Kemp29Rebs:Shawn Kemp13Asts:Payton,Schrempf3 each |  | Pts:Michael Jordan29Rebs:Dennis Rodman20Asts:Michael Jordan8\nChicago leads the series, 2–0\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T. Rush\nGame 2 started well for Seattle with a 27–23 first quarter lead. However, Seattle would once again lose the lead before halftime. Despite Shawn Kemp's 29 points and 13 rebounds, Chicago triumphed with a final score of 92 to 88. In the victory, Dennis Rodman tied an NBA Finals record with 11 offensive rebounds and made a clutch free throw near the end of the game to seal the Bulls victory. Michael Jordan once again led the Bulls with 29 points, while Shawn Kemp continued his strong play by scoring 29 points for Seattle.\n\nGame 3\n\nNBC\nJune 97:30 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls108,Seattle SuperSonics86\nScoring by quarter:34–16,28–22, 13–23,33–25\nPts:Michael Jordan36Rebs:Dennis Rodman10Asts:Scottie Pippen9 |  | Pts:Detlef Schrempf20Rebs:Brickowski,Payton7 eachAsts:Gary Payton9\nChicago leads the series, 3–0\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nThe Sonics, owners of a 44–5 home record (including playoffs),[2] suffered a 22-point blow-out in their return to Seattle, giving the Bulls a seemingly insurmountable 3–0 series lead. Frustration would once again set in for the Sonics, as Frank Brickowski was ejected for committing a flagrant foul on Dennis Rodman.

In an attempt to spark his team, Coach George Karl gave Jordan's defensive assignment to Gary Payton, a move which showed immediate results.[3] Seattle succeeded with a 107–86 win over the Bulls, and Sonics fans taunted the Bulls players with homemade signs reading \"Sweepless in Seattle\".[4] The Sonics were helped by the return of team captain Nate McMillan whose presence entering the game brought the KeyArena crowd to its feet.\n\nSeattle's victory prevented the NBA Finals from being swept in two consecutive years (something which, as of 2024, has never occurred).[5]\n\nGame 5\n\nNBC\nJune 149:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls78,Seattle SuperSonics89\nScoring by quarter:18–18, 24–25, 18–19, 18–27\nPts:Michael Jordan26Rebs:Dennis Rodman12Asts:Scottie Pippen5 |  | Pts:Gary Payton23Rebs:Shawn Kemp10Asts:Gary Payton6\nChicago leads the series, 3–2\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T.

It just took too long. We should have come with this a little earlier.\"[6] Shawn Kemp's performance in this game was considered by many to be his best in a Seattle uniform.\n\nGame 6\n\nNBC\nJune 167:30 pm\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics75,Chicago Bulls87\nScoring by quarter:18–24, 20–21, 20–22, 17–20\nPts:Detlef Schrempf23Rebs:Shawn Kemp14Asts:Gary Payton7 |  | Pts:Michael Jordan22Rebs:Dennis Rodman19Asts:Michael Jordan7\nChicago wins the NBA Finals, 4–2\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nChicago won the series four games to two on Father's Day, in what would be the last time the Sonics played a Finals game before relocating to Oklahoma City and being renamed the Thunder. The Bulls' victory was partly due to the stellar performance of power forward Dennis Rodman, who delivered a repeat of his Game 2 performance with 19 rebounds, tying his own NBA Finals record. Bulls star Michael Jordan finished the game with 22 points and collected his fourth Finals MVP.\n\nAs of 2024, no NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit, and only four teams have forced a Game 7 after dropping the first three contests: the New York Knicks (1951), Denver Nuggets (1994), Portland Trail Blazers (2003), and Boston Celtics (2023).[7][8]\n\nPlayer statistics\n\nGP | Games played | GS | Games started | MPG | Minutesper game\nFG% | Field-goalpercentage | 3P% | 3-point field-goalpercentage | FT% | Free-throwpercentage\nRPG | Reboundsper game | APG | Assistsper game | SPG | Stealsper game\nBPG | Blocksper game | PPG | Pointsper game |  | \nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nRandy Brown | 6 | 0 | 8.2 | .500 | .500 | .500 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 2.8\nJud Buechler | 6 | 0 | 5.6 | .222 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.7\nRon Harper | 6 | 4 | 19.3 | .375 | .308 | .917 | 2.3 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 6.5\nMichael Jordan | 6 | 6 | 42.0 | .415 | .316 | .836 | 5.3 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.2 | 27.3\nSteve Kerr | 6 | 0 | 18.8 | .303 | .182 | .857 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 5.0\nToni Kukoč | 6 | 2 | 29.5 | .423 | .313 | .800 | 4.8 | 3.5 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 13.0\nLuc Longley | 6 | 6 | 28.3 | .574 | .000 | .727 | 3.8 | 2.2 | 0.6 | 1.8 | 11.7\nScottie Pippen | 6 | 6 | 41.3 | .343 | .231 | .708 | 8.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 1.3 | 15.7\nDennis Rodman | 6 | 6 | 37.5 | .486 | .000 | .579 | 14.7 | 2.5 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 7.5\nJohn Salley | 5 | 0 | 3.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nBill Wennington | 6 | 0 | 7.0 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.9\nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nVincent Askew | 4 | 0 | 15.5 | .222 | .200 | 1.000 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 1.8\nFrank Brickowski | 6 | 3 | 11.3 | .222 | .200 | .000 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.8\nHersey Hawkins | 6 | 6 | 38.3 | .455 | .273 | .923 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 0.2 | 13.3\nErvin Johnson | 3 | 3 | 6.7 | .333 | .000 | .000 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 1.3\nShawn Kemp | 6 | 6 | 40.3 | .551 | .000 | .857 | 10.0 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 2.0 | 23.3\nNate McMillan | 4 | 0 | 12.8 | .429 | .600 | 1.000 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 2.8\nGary Payton | 6 | 6 | 45.7 | .444 | .333 | .731 | 6.3 | 7.0 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 18.0\nSam Perkins | 6 | 0 | 31.7 | .377 | .235 | .810 | 4.7 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 11.2\nSteve Scheffler | 4 | 0 | 2.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDetlef Schrempf | 6 | 6 | 39.7 | .443 | .389 | .875 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 16.3\nEric Snow | 6 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDavid Wingate | 6 | 0 | 8.0 | .500 | .500 | 1.000 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.5\nBroadcasting\n\nThe Finals was aired in the United States on NBC. Bob Costas hosted the pre-game, halftime and post-game show with analysts Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey. Games were called by Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton, while Ahmad Rashad and Hannah Storm served as sideline reporters.\n\nThe local NBC stations of the participants were WMAQ-TV (Chicago) and KING-TV (Seattle).\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 1996 NBA Finals would be the last Finals appearance of the Seattle SuperSonics. The Sonics would win the Pacific Division again in 1997 and 1998, but fell in the second round of the playoffs each time. The series was George Karl's only Finals appearance in his coaching career. In 2008, the Sonics franchise moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. They would make the finals four years later after the move, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.\n\nThis was also the last time a Seattle-based team played for a major professional sports championship until Super Bowl XL in 2006, when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Seahawks would go on to handily defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and lose to the New England Patriots the following year in Super Bowl XLIX. In terms of overall sports leagues, the city would later enjoy six additional championships: the WNBA's Seattle Storm, a one-time SuperSonics sister team, won the 2004, the 2010, the 2018, and the 2020 WNBA Finals, and the MLS's Seattle Sounders FC won 2016 MLS Cup and 2019 MLS Cup.\n\nTeams from Chicago and Seattle would meet three more times in postseason competition among the \"Big Four\" leagues. The only time Seattle won over Chicago was in the 2000 American League Division Series, when the Seattle Mariners swept the Chicago White Sox 3–0. Meanwhile, the Seahawks lost to the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of both the 2006 and 2010 NFL playoffs.\n\nThe Bulls came close to winning 70 games for the second straight year, instead settling for a 69-win campaign in 1997. They won their second straight title over the Utah Jazz in six games of the 1997 NBA Finals. In the off-season that preceded Scottie Pippen became the first person to win the NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics.[9] The Bulls would also defeat the Utah Jazz in six games in the 1998 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls' combined 87 wins in the regular season and postseason would stand as an NBA record until the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, coached by former Bull Steve Kerr, broke it with 88 total wins (thanks to the first round using a best-of-7 format instead of the best-of-5 in 1996), including a 73–9 regular season mark. However, the Warriors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, failing to repeat as champions after beating the same Cavaliers in the previous Finals.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and

            "raw_content": "Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan has won 6 rings!\n\nMichael Jordan has won championships with:\n\n1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\n\nMichael Jordan won championship rings in half of his 13 seasons with the Chicago Bulls. He won six championships with the Bulls and led the team to two titles with three goals each. Jordan won his first championship in 1991 against Magic Johnson and the Lakers. That was followed by two consecutive titles in 1992 against the Blazers and 1993 against the Suns.\n\nChampionship rings have been part of the culture since the first NBA Finals in 1947. It’s amazing that Michael Jordan has won six such rings. The value of a championship ring remains priceless to those who receive it, as it is a souvenir of those who have worked hard to win the championship.\n\nYou can’t compare a ring won by an NBA legend like Michael Jordan to an average NBA player. Championship rings won by classic NBA teams, like the ones mentioned above, are expensive. If you buy or inherit an NBA championship ring from a legendary team like the Chicago Bulls of 1996, Boston Celtics of 1986, Lakers of 2001, or Lakers of 1987, you have a mini-bench in your closet. For example, the Herald Sun reported that a 1996 NBA championship ring from a member of the Bulls was for sale on eBay for $29,923. It is better if the team in question has performed excellently in the year in which they have won the championship.\n\nAs the league’s leading scorer and MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year never had enough of his lightness like Michael Jordan. He played the regular season to tell other players that he was better than them and that if they were in the upcoming playoffs, he would catch up with them. His only goal at any point was to focus on winning a ring at the end of the season.\n\nWinning the championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994-95 was a big deal. A ring can cost between $20,000 and $300,000. It really depends on who wears the ring. Hakeem Olajuwon had a championship ring, which was certainly a great start.\n\nI compared the constant value and relative value of the four players in the postseason to show that Michael Jordan is separating himself from the others, and the three that separate him from the six rings that matter.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA gold medal, the others being Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson. Russell’s 11 championships are the most of any player in NBA history.\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. He did the job at both ends of the floor, leading the Chicago Bulls to eight rings in six seasons, two of which were three-goal throws. Jordan dominated the NBA from the start, finishing with a perfect 6-0 record in the Finals, which is unlikely to happen again given the nature and dynamics of the league.\n\nBill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Shaquille O’Neal. Kareem, Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and Horace Grant had a season in which he scored 16.2 points per game in the postseason.\n\nA look at the Robin factor from year to year shows that Jordan has not benefited in any form or form from distorted seasons. His six rings make up six of the highest seven scores. He’s the only player you can’t argue with in the team.\n\nOnly four players in NBA history who haven’t played for Boston have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships during his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs. Seven of Russell’s teammates in Boston had seven or more championships. Including Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7).\n\nNo more than a handful of senior members of staff carry this rare distinction, in addition, of course, to the triumvirate of six-time champions Jordan, Pippen and Phil Jackson. Capp’s legacy is defined by his membership of the Bulls’ elite club, which has won six NBA championship titles and a complete set of club championship rings.\n\nIn fact, Jordan had six finals MVPs to the other two or two plays. As for Russell, in his first two championship teams and in his last, it was obvious he wasn’t even the second best player on the team. He was the youngest player on a team full of Hall of Famers and a veteran in his prime.\n\nThe steal and the shot, if you will, but my favorite moment of the game was the call from NBC’s Bob Costas. It’s one of the most iconic calls of all time. It was part of what made the legend of Michael Jordan so powerful. When the Bulls didn’t have the ball, you knew MJ was going to find a way to change that.\n\nDespite the fact that his doubters claimed he was just a regular-season player and would never be able to lead the Bulls into the ring, no one heard one. He was able to enjoy the taste of fame and he never looked back.\n\nAt 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls (13, 1984-93, 1995-98), the Washington Wizards and a few others in 2001-03. Jordan’s greatest years came with the Bulls in the 1990s, when he led them to six championships and as many finals appearances in eight years. He recorded a remarkable number for a player who was nearly 40 years old (35 when he was in the twilight of his career with the Wizards).\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in all 82 games. In the postseason, he averaged 30.7 points, 49 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals as the Bulls lost just one game en route to the finals. In the final, the Bulls jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and the SuperSonics. But the Sonics retaliated with two straight wins, and Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\nThe tip of the ring has a characteristic emblematic shape, embellished with the Bulls logo, a red stone with golden trims and horns in the middle and synthetic diamond and stone rivets on the face. The ring is engraved with 10K on the inside of Jostens Manufacturers.\n\nPlayers Name | Michael Jordan\nHow Many Rings | 6\nDrafted By | Chicago Bulls\nWon Rings With | 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\nPlayers College | North Carolina\nPlayers Birthday | February 17, 1963\nHometown | Brooklyn, New York\nYear Drafted | 1984\nRound Drafted | 1\nPick Drafted | 3\nRELATED RINGS\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n"

The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

However, by the 2022-23 season, we see a more even distribution of three-point attempts across positions, with centers and power forwards contributing more from beyond the arc. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shift suggests that the NBA is moving toward a model where \"shooting bigs\" are becoming more common, while point guards are not necessarily relied upon as primary three-point shooters.\n\n3-Pointers by Team\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nStatistical Increases: The Modern NBA’s Offensive Explosion\n\nAcross all three seasons, there has been a noticeable increase in points, assists, and rebounds, with three-pointers seeing the most significant rise. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis trend underscores the growing emphasis on the three-point shot as a primary offensive weapon. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in these statistics is a testament to the evolution of the game, where teams are not only scoring more but also relying heavily on the three-point line to do so.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nComparing Generational Talents: Jordan, Curry, Jokic, and Green\n\nThe Future of the NBA: What’s Next?\n\n"

The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.\n\nArticle Details\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nReferences\n\nAlsasua, R., Lapresa, D., Arana, J., Anguera, M.T., & Garzón, B.

Pontifical University of Salamanca. Salamanca, Spain. Mario Amatria Jiménez. Pontifical University of Salamanca. Salamanca, Spain. ABSTRACT This article aimed to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan by studying his technical actions, shots, and relationship with teammates. The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. INTRODUCTION Basketball is one of the most practiced sports in the world (Quispe, 2023) and research has traditionally focused on aspects such as training, biomechanics, health and injuries, and physiology (Amirnordin et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Shi & Wu, 2024). However, technical-tactical studies, carried out from systematic observation, have not been sufficiently developed (Remmert, 2003) to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of increasingly sophisticated data analysis software, combined with the development of rigorous methodological approaches, provided researchers the tools to prove or disprove numerous theories about basketball that, until then, lacked scientific credibility. A particularly prominent area of the current research in the field of basketball is the relationship between physiological demands and the technical-tactical performance that players develop (Figueira et al, 2022). The depth and sophistication of these interactions, directly related to creativity and intra-team coordination (Furley & Memmert, 2015), confirm that basketball, along with its underlying structures, is a complex system (Klostermann et al., 2018). This complexity of the game generates complex data when studied, which, if simplified and decomposed into measurable units, becomes easier to analyse (Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In the case of basketball, this \"simplification\" is the only way to validate associations and/or causal relationships that occur during the game and obtain behavioural structures and interactions between them, from a certain distance, that does not affect their development. In this complex game, the whole, which means the team, is more than the sum of its parts, hence the importance of understanding how different players interact and relate to each other. One of the main data analysis techniques to analyse complex interactions in sports is polar coordinate analysis applied to data collected through systematic observation (Anguera & Hernández-Mendo, 2015; Castañer et al., 2016, 2017). Polar coordinate analysis can be used to measure the spontaneous behaviour of players interacting in their natural environment from the perspective of a specific behaviour, known as focal behaviour, having been performed with a high degree of success in other team sports such as soccer (Maneiro & Amatria, 2018) or handball (Navarro et al, 2018). In this sense, this typology of analysis has proven to be an effective tool to decompose the complexity of the game (Lago & Anguera, 2002; Castellano & Hernández-Mendo, 2003; Perea et al., 2012; Robles et al., 2013). Its application to the study of several of the best athletes in the world from various collective sports disciplines (Castañer et al., 2016; Castañer et al., 2017; Maneiro and Amatria, 2018) has allowed researchers to obtain practical conclusions about what makes these players excellent and, in return, make recommendations to improve the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. However, polar coordinate analysis has not yet been tested in players with a specific demarcation such as shooting guards. Most of the research on shooting guards is based on different groups of players based on their position in the field between this specific demarcation and point guards, obtaining interconnected results, which in no case can be confirmed as definitive for this type of demarcation, that is, the data analysed is generally outside the specific context of the actions and tactical technical performance developed by these players (Gómez et al, 2007; Sampaio et al., 2008). On the other hand, the relationships that occur between players are usually viewed through a prism focused on their traditional role according to their position on the field. However, in today's basketball, where greater versatility is increasingly required from players, only three key positions (guard, forward and centre) are identified, according to Sampaio et al. (2006), leaving the shooting guard position diluted and integrated in a non-specific way as such. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 109 This happens since the traditional mission of the shooting guard is characterized by their permeability, being a driving force that helps the point guards to organize the game and raise the ball, as well as having mastered shots at all distances (outside, inside and free throws), an aspect that conditions him to be the team's highest scorer and the player with the greatest responsibility attacking. This is why his identification as such is not defined, since he shares the functions of point guard and small forward. In this sense, Fransen et al. (2016), in their study on leadership in sport, determine that the players with main rolls in the game are in a very beneficial spatial position that, in combination with their high tactical responsibilities, positions them as team leaders. Following this line, there are many current examples of great international players that play this position such as Stephen Curry, Luca Doncic or James Hardem, who have as role models players like Kobe Bryant, who had at the same time Michael Jordan as an idol to emulate, latter considered the best shooting guard of all time (Greer, 2023). Given the above, it is considered appropriate to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the best shooting guards of all time in his natural environment. This will be carried out through the study of his interactions between teammates and his executed technique, aiming to unequivocally and scientifically establish the elements that must be present in players who play or wish to play in this position that is so relevant in basketball. Applying a robust methodological approach, combined with in-depth multidimensional analysis of rigorously coded data, will help provide objective insights into how Michael Jordan interacts with his environment and makes him unique. The specific objective is to analyse Michael Jordan's technical skills in the NBA playoff final of the 1995-1996 season through his technical actions, his shoots and his relationship with his teammates. METHOD To carry out the development of the present research, the Observational Methodology (Anguera, 1979) has been applied. The research design, in accordance with Sánchez-Algarra and Anguera (2013), follows an Idiographic model –given that a single team is the unit of study–, a Tracking model –studying during the games that constitute the finals of the 1995-1996 playoffs–, and a Multidimensional model –due to the categories that form the dimensions constituting the observation instrument. The conducted observation has been guided by scientific criteria with total perceptiveness and as a non-participating observer. Participants/Sample The observational sampling conducted has been intentional (Anguera, et al., 2011) with the American professional basketball team Chicago Bulls during the development of the playoff finals for the NBA Champion title in the 1995-1996 season (in this season, the Chicago Bulls won 72 games, breaking the all-time record for most victories in a season, a record that lasted for 20 years). The videos used are publicly available television broadcasts that have been retrieved for the study. All offensive sequences developed by the team during the 6 games that make up the finals of that season –1995-1996– have been coded. The 521 coded offensive sequences consist of 4798 multi-events. Intersessional consistency has been ensured through the following elements: the same ball size, the same court dimensions, the same game time, the same players on the roster, and the same jersey assignments. Observation instrument The present research required the development of an ad hoc observation instrument –see Table 1– which drew from the following sources: the works of Alsasua et al. (2018) and Arroyo et al. (2022). The instrument adapted their contributions and included new dimensions –Player Position, Defensive System, and Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 110 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. Consequence– which will provide a solid foundation for addressing the research objective. The instrument is a combination of nested category systems in field formats –dimensions. These categories adhere to the premise of being exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Table 1.

Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 111 Recording and coding The data was recorded (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2014) using Lince software, version 1.2.1 (Gabin et al., 2012), achieving an intra-observer agreement value of .91. The obtained data is of type IV, i.e., concurrent and time-based (Anguera et al., 2011). Subsequently, two additional programs were employed. The first one was Gseq v5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011), through which sequential analysis of delays was conducted. Later, the program Hoisan, version 1.2 (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2012), was utilized. The data obtained from the previous software was entered and analysed for obtaining polar coordinates. Finally, for the representation of results, the ObserTools application (Rodríguez-Medina et al., 2021) was employed. Data quality The data collection was carried out by two graduates in Sports Science with extensive experience in the studied sport and the use of observational methodology. However, the observers received specific training for data collection in this study following the phases recommended by Anguera (2003). The primary observer recorded all sequences comprising the observational sampling, while the second observer recorded 16.7% of the total sample. The reliability of the obtained data was calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between nominal classifications where there is no order of ranking. GSEQ software version 5.1 was used for the calculation of this coefficient following the recommendations established by Bakeman & Quera (2011). The concordance index achieved by the primary observer was .91 (intra-observer agreement). Regarding the result of inter-observer agreement, it was higher than .86 in all games included in the study (game 1 = .93; game 2 = .87; game 3 = .94; game 5 = .88, game 6 = .87). Considering these concordance data, it can be stated that the agreement is almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977). Data analysis Two types of data analysis have been employed to address the stated objectives: synchronous analysis and diachronic analysis. Synchronous analysis through inferential statistics has been used to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria, using the Pearson chi-square statistic (χ²). This was done by applying the following formula: χ2 = ∑ [(𝐹 𝑖𝑗−𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗)2 𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑘 𝑖,𝑗=1 The computation of this statistic was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0. Regarding the diachronic analysis, polar coordinates analysis has been employed, which is a very recent typology of analysis in sports science (Anguera and Hernández-Mendo, 2015). Cochran's Zsum (1954) is the foundation and origin of this analysis technique, which applies and is based on the principle that the sum of N independent z scores is normally distributed, with Z = 0 and s = N. Thus, the statistic 𝑍sum = ∑ 𝑧 √𝑛 𝑚 𝑙 (where n is the number of delays), according to Sackett (1980), allows measuring the strength or associative consistency between different behaviours. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 112 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. The polar coordinates technique, developed by Sackett (1980) and later refined by Anguera (1997), is utilized to identify the relationships between behaviours. The technique involves one of these behaviours: the conditioning behaviour or focal behaviour and the remaining behaviours, which constitute the various dimensions of the observation instrument (conditioned behaviours). This analysis is performed both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (-1 to -5), resulting in a vector for each behaviour related to the focal behaviour, with a specific angle and radius. Based on the angle obtained by the vector, it can occupy one of the four quadrants or sectors that make up the polar coordinate. Depending on the quadrant the vector occupies, the activation or inhibition relationship between behaviours varies. In quadrant I, the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. In quadrant II, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the retrospective plane, while it is not in the prospective plane. In quadrant III, the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour in both the prospective and retrospective planes. Lastly, in quadrant IV, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the prospective plane, while it is not in the retrospective plane. RESULTS During Jordan's participation in the 6 games that make up the sample, he interacts with the ball a total of 536 times out of the team's total of 2996 interventions, accounting for 17.89% of the actions in the offensive play where the ball goes through his hands. Regarding the technical actions executed by Michael Jordan, the obtained results indicate the presence of significant differences (χ² = 163006; p < .001). Standout actions include dribbling –Drib– with 35.9%, Free-throw shooting –Lan– (11.9%), and Dribble –Bot– (12.6%), percentages superior in all cases to the results achieved by his teammates. On the other hand, RP –reception and pass– and Pas –pass– actions present lower percentage results compared to the rest of the teammates with 34.0% and 2.7%, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

Notably, the actions of TEs –Static Shot– (31.9%) and TAtR –Backward Jump Shot– with 15.9% stand out in this regard. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 113 Effectiveness Regarding shooting effectiveness, i.e., the success of making or missing the shooting action, the results obtained, when comparing the performances of Michael Jordan with the rest of his teammates, show significant differences (χ² = 1615, p < .001) in favour of Michael Jordan, presenting much higher shooting efficiency percentages than the rest of his teammates –Table 4. Table 4. Shooting effectiveness. Ineffective Effective Other players 54.1% 45.9% Michael Jordan 48.8% 51.2% There are no significant differences in Jordan's involvement and the moment of the game, nor between the moment and the effectiveness of the shot, nor between the moment and the effectiveness between games. Finally, the results obtained are presented regarding the associative analysis through the use of polar coordinates technique, where Michael Jordan is related to the rest of the players in the squad who participated in the different games played. For the development of this analysis, the focal behaviour J23 has been related to the rest of the categories that make up the dimension (J33, J91, J13, J07, J09, J25, J34, J08, J22, J30, J00, J53, and J35), as well as with itself (J23). This analysis aims to verify the relationship established between Michael Jordan and the rest of the teammates throughout the final phase. The results obtained (Table 5 and Figure 1) show the criterion category J23 (Michael Jordan) with a radius of 7.24 and an angle of 45 degrees in quadrant I, where the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. Also, the categories J25 (Steve Kerr), J22 (John Salley), J00 (Randy Brown), J34 (Bill Wennington), and J30 (Jud Buechler) are observed with radii of 5.96, 3.69, 3.02, 3.33, and 2.96, and angles of 223.63°, 230.61°, 259.26°, 226.63°, and 238.32° respectively, in quadrant III, where the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. Figure 1. Representation of the behavioural map establishing category J23 as the focal behaviour in relation to his teammates in the 1996 finals matches. DISCUSSION Following Anguera and Hernández-Mendo (2015), the effectiveness of observational methodology lies in its ability to conduct a diachronic analysis with type II and type IV data, meaning data that include an order and a time component. However, conventional synchronic statistical analyses are also relevant, seeking associations between dimensions that provide categorical data to meet the objectives established in match analysis (O’Donoghue, 2009). Regarding the technical actions performed by Michael Jordan, dribbling stands out as the most prominent. This technical action is characteristic of shooting guards, who, unlike point guards, not only have offensive construction responsibilities, but also play a role in breaking the repetitive dynamics of the attack and are players with a high degree of technical proficiency (Okazaki et al., 2004; De Rose et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007). Regarding his shooting performance, Jordan demonstrates a particular expertise in free throw shooting, with a very high success rate. In this regard, this proficiency, coupled with his publicly acknowledged dedication to practicing this technique after daily training sessions, is closely linked to dribbling, as through these one-on-one situations, he manages to draw personal fouls in his favour, and these situations end up leading to free throw attempts, proving to be a decisive performance factor in basketball (Csataljay et al., 2009; Paulauskas et al., 2018). On the other hand, concerning the type of shot Jordan executes most notable, it is the fadeaway. This shooting style became his signature move, not only due to its repetition as the team's offensive finish but also because of his accuracy in scoring. This shooting technique serves as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned dribbling technique. Jordan uses dribbling as a deceptive move or feint to create optimal space, combined with the slight distance gained from the defender when jumping backward, allowing for a higher likelihood of successful execution (Courel-Ibañez et al., 2017). Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 115 In this regard, considering Jordan's shooting efficiency during the finals, especially if we take into account the volume and relevance of his shots, it can be observed the significance of this player in the team's scoring success. The precision in field goals is a crucial factor in achieving success in a game, as these variables represent both individual and collective offensive effectiveness (García et al., 2013; Malarranha et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, professional basketball has undergone significant development and evolution in the game over the last decade, showcasing players with increasingly versatile profiles (Courel-Ibáñez et al., 2017; Mateus et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to update knowledge about performance profiles in young players with professional potential and assess their suitability for today's high-level basketball (Ibáñez et al., 2018). However, it is crucial not to overlook the qualities and capabilities of players who have left their mark on the history of international basketball, particularly in the NBA, where players often exhibit a higher degree of specialization in their game compared to other competitions (Paulauskas et al., 2018). CONCLUSIONS The objective set in this research was to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan in the NBA 1995-1996 playoff finals through his technical actions, shooting, and his relationship with his teammates. To address this objective, two types of analyses, synchronous and diachronic, have been employed, through which, based on the results obtained, the following conclusions can be reached: - Regarding his actions, dribbling stands out, as well as the execution of free throws, which are strongly related elements. Here, Jordan demonstrates excellent ball control and 1x1 skills, forcing defences to engage with more than one opponent and causing defensive personal fouls. - The type of shot he performs that stands out is the fadeaway, a shooting action strongly linked to 1x1 situations. This provides a wide variety of resources and solutions to different 1x1 and even 1x2 scenarios for this player, making defending him a very complex situation due to the unpredictability of his actions. - Jordan is a completely consistent player with effectiveness indices in his actions and a level of participation that remains constant during all four quarters of each game and throughout the six games that make up the NBA finals. - The relationship between Jordan and his teammates does not show significant results exclusively with himself. This is interpreted as a player with great adaptability who both includes his teammates and is included by them in the plays, and the results clearly identify the team as rotation or non-participative. These types of studies allow us to advance and better understand the game of one of the best basketball players in the world. This enables the replication of his actions and a deeper comprehension and appreciation of the evolution of this sport. Similarly, this study serves as guidance for coaches and players in developmental categories, where the specificity of the position is less emphasized, and a more versatile player profile is increasingly valued, capable of effectively participating in the entire development of offensive actions.

Consider one such debate: who is the NBA’s greatest of all time (henceforth referred to as the GOAT)? While social isolation has stripped NBA fans of a thrilling regular season finish and leaves large what-ifs surrounding what would certainly have been the most compelling postseason in the better part of 10 years, it has amply fanned the flames of the old GOAT argument. With no new basketball to consume, I, like many fans, have allowed myself to be consumed by discussing the GOAT across various social media platforms, on FaceTime calls with siblings, or even in appropriately socially distanced activities.\n\nMany of these discussions have come about as a consequence of the riveting docu-series “The Last Dance” (focusing on the Chicago Bulls of the 1980s and ‘90s). Surely no NBA fan can watch the drama of these Bulls teams without being drawn into the GOAT conversation by their singular star, Michael Jeffrey Jordan. No discussion of the GOAT can be taken seriously without the consideration of Michael Jordan, the legendary shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls. Frankly, the GOAT debate begins and ends here for a large portion of NBA fans, and for good reason. Michael Jordan’s individual and team accomplishments literally fill books, and those accolades do not account for his cultural impact on basketball in the US and across the globe. Furthermore, his appeal and impact on a global level fail to do justice to the intensity of his individual preparation and competitive drive which inspired and elevated a generation of NBA All-Stars that followed in his footsteps.\n\nDespite all this, GOAT cases are made (legitimately) for players that came before and after Michael Jordan. Indeed, if the question was easily settled, there would be no debate. And yet, the debate rages on, with varying levels of rhetorical and analytical rigor but with all the fevered passion of a contest that has come down to the wire. The purpose of this report is to approach the GOAT conversation in a data-reinforced manner. I look beyond traditional box score metrics to quantify Michael Jordan’s case for the GOAT, though my own analytical biases will inevitably arise.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make the case for Michael Jordan as the NBA’s GOAT, beginning with a suitable data set is critical. In the case of MJ, I did not find it sensible to compare him to every NBA player that has ever played because (no disrespect) he would simply outshine most of them to an enormous extent. Moreover, the field of potential GOAT candidates has been whittled down over time to a relative handful of players (48 in the case of my data set) by people who form the NBA’s All-Decade teams. These teams are comprised of the greatest players in the 1980, ’90s, and so on until present. I considered only the All-Decade teams from the 1980s until the 2010s because 1) data and advanced statistics for previous players were inconsistently available, 2) the introduction of the 3-point line in 1979 skews scoring statistics from before this time period, and 3) Michael Jordan either played against or inspired the players on this list (often both).\n\nIn terms of the data set’s composition, I chose to shy away from traditional box score or “counting” statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) in favor of more “advanced” metrics. One of the issues with sports data is high levels of correlation between variables. For example, a player who scores a lot of points may also rebound a lot and have a high number of assists, all because they happen to be on the court for a large portion of the game. Having high correlation between your variables is like listening to a song with two guitarists: you may like the sound overall, but it is hard to tell which of the two guitarist is making “more” of the sound you like. Similarly, if we are trying to measure the impact of one variable or another, if they are highly correlated, we may not be able to tell which variable is the most impactful, which can lead to unreliable results when attempting to analyze the data.\n\nPart of the solution to this problem is to use advanced metrics, which are designed to combine and adjust more traditional measures to create measures that take some of the correlation problems out of a data set and also give more insight into a player’s impact on the game. Some of the advanced metrics included in this data set are described below (mostly paraphrased from basketball-reference.com’s excellent glossary):\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating — a combination of various counting statistics that essentially counts a player’s positive and negative statistical contributions, adjusts them for the pace of the game, and compares each individual to the league average in order to determine efficiency.\n\nUsage Rate — an estimate of the percentage of team’s plays that an individual player used.\n\nBox Plus/Minus — an estimate of how many points a player contributed above a league-average player on a league average team. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nWin Shares — an estimate that assigns a “share” of each team win to each player based on that player’s contribution to the win. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage — a measure of shooting efficiency based on shot type.\n\nFree Throw and Three Point Rates — these rates are measures of offensive efficiency, measuring and-1 free throws and the proportion of field goal attempts from three-point range.\n\nInitial Visualizations and Observations\n\nTo begin analyzing the data, I decided to take a look at plots that detail some of the attributes that make a player truly great. The first of these is a scatter plot comparing usage and efficiency, color coded by decade and sized by win shares. Why might usage and efficiency be an interesting comparison? Well, because there is generally a trade off between the two. Typically, a player that is used more is less efficient (think more turnovers, more missed shots, etc.). Conversely, a highly efficient player may appear more efficient because they are not used at a high rate. With that trade off scenario in mind, take a look at the following plot, comparing the usage and efficiency of the All-Decade teams:\n\nA few things stand out. First, with these GOAT candidates, there is hardly any evidence of a trade off between usage and efficiency. If anything, there is a positive correlation, meaning higher usage is related to higher efficiency. I take this as evidence of the greatness of all these players. Second, there is a noticeable difference in the distribution of players in some decades: those in the 1980s tended to be more in the lower left corner up through the center of the plot, while players in the 2010s seem to drift from center up toward the upper right corner. While there are several interpretations for this, I tend to think the emphasis on making the game “more” efficient in recent years can explain this trend. Despite that trend, however, the final point is the most striking to me: Michael Jordan is the most highly used and the most efficient of all the players in the data set and he has among the highest win shares to boot. If you were looking for one player that you could use again and again and again and still get efficient results at a historical level, look no further than MJ.\n\nThe next two charts are somewhat similar in that they look at a player’s impact on the defensive and offensive aspects of the game. I took win shares per 48 minutes and box plus/minus, broke them down into their offensive and defensive components, and plotted the players to show what end of the floor each player impacted the most.\n\nHere, the results match intuition to a large degree. Perennial defensive stalwarts like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are firmly in the high defense, low offense corner of the graphs, whereas prolific offensive players like Adrian Dantley and Steve Nash drift out more toward the high offense and low defense corner. Who occupies the coveted high offense, high defense corner, you ask? Who else? While David Robinson and LeBron James both edge into the realm, Jordan represents the pinnacle of a player who impacts the game at an elite level on both ends of the floor. Combine this with his best-in-class efficiency and usage rates, and his case for the GOAT solidifies.\n\nFactor Analysis — Drawing the GOAT with math\n\nDespite the evidence presented above, it is important to remember that those comparisons of usage versus efficiency and offensive versus defensive prowess are ones that I came up with, and therefore, they reflect my biases about what the GOAT should look like. Instead, factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) allows us the opportunity to mathematically determine a few “factors” (combinations of variables) that best describe the data set. In other words, factor analysis can be a way to check if our intuition about what factors are important in determining who the GOAT is. Running a factor analysis on this data set, we have the following three factors:\n\nThere are a few important things to break down here. First, the way to read the three factor columns is to look for the largest numbers in each column and see which variables they correspond with. Doing this, we might say that factor 1 emphasizes the importance of offensive efficiency, while factor 2 emphasizes defense, and factor 3 emphasizes usage. This reading of the factors somewhat reinforces my intuition of what attributes are important in determining the GOAT.\n\nSecond, the little red box at the bottom of the table indicates how much of the variation in the data set can be explained by the three factors above, about 65%. That means there is still about 35% of the differences between these players that cannot be explained by the data included in these factors. That is not surprising, and it is certainly a good reminder that these comparisons I shared should be taken with a grain of salt. However, there is at least some evidence that looking for an elite two-way player with high usage and high efficiency will get you on a suitable path for determining the GOAT.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these numbers and charts will do nothing to settle the debate over the GOAT once and for all, they certainly provide strong evidence for Michael Jordan. He occupies a nearly untouchable statistical echelon in terms of being a highly used and highly efficient player who dominates on both ends of the floor, even when compared to the best players from the last 40 years of NBA basketball. Doubtless, there are many ways to slice and dice this debate, but if anything, these findings make clear that any other competitor for GOAT is playing on MJ’s home court, and it’s his ball.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPublished in The Sports Scientist\n\nIn depth view of the world of Sports through the lens of Data Science, and Analytics\n\nWritten by Trevor Ram\n\nWriting about things I want to write about\n\nNo responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

It’s a topic that always sparks debate, so I figured I’d dig into the stats and the context to see what I could find. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a ride.\n\nFirst things first, I had to gather the data. I started by hitting up the usual suspects: Basketball-Reference, ESPN, *. I was looking for game logs, series results, player stats – the whole shebang. I spent a good chunk of the morning just sifting through all that information. Copy-pasting into a spreadsheet, you know the drill. It wasn’t pretty, but it had to be done.\n\nRelated posts\n\nWhat makes the Scoot Henderson shoe unique on the court? (Explore the technology behind his signature model)\n\nShaheen Holloway: A look at his coaching strategies.\n\nOnce I had the raw data, I started cleaning it up. This is where the fun really begins, right? Wrong! It’s tedious as heck. Removing duplicates, standardizing player names, making sure the dates lined up. Hours vanished into the abyss. But hey, garbage in, garbage out, so I powered through.\n\nNext, I wanted to understand the context of each Finals loss. It’s not enough to just look at the scores. Who were the opponents? Were there any major injuries? What was the team dynamic like? I dove into old articles, blog posts, even some YouTube highlights to get a better feel for what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nNow for the analysis. I looked at LeBron’s individual performance in those losses. Points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting percentages – the whole nine yards. I compared his stats to his regular season averages, and to his performance in winning Finals series. I was trying to see if there were any consistent patterns or differences.\n\nThen I shifted my focus to his teammates. How did they perform in those losing efforts? Were they stepping up, or were they struggling? I looked at their scoring, their defense, their overall contribution to the team. I was trying to figure out if LeBron was carrying the team, or if there were other factors at play.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t ignore the opposing teams. Who were the key players? What were their strengths and weaknesses? What was their game plan for stopping LeBron? I broke down their defensive strategies, their offensive schemes, and their overall team chemistry.\n\nAfter all that digging, I started to form some conclusions. It became clear that LeBron’s Finals losses weren’t always about him. Sometimes, he was just outmatched by a better team. Sometimes, his teammates didn’t provide enough support. And sometimes, it was just plain bad luck.\n\nI know some people will say that LeBron’s Finals record is a black mark on his legacy. But I think it’s important to remember that he’s faced some incredibly tough competition over the years. He’s gone up against some of the greatest players and teams in NBA history. And he’s always given it his all.\n\nSo yeah, that’s my journey through LeBron’s Finals losses. It was a lot of work, but I learned a ton. And hopefully, it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to win at the highest level.\n\nRuud vs Cerundolo Prediction: Key Stats and Insights\n\nAre you searching for the surreal crossword clue answer?

James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

            "raw_content": "Sports. Honestly. Since 2011\n\nLebron James: In Defense of Six Finals Losses\n\nThough LeBron James has become synonymous with the NBA Finals, ever since left the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010, he has become the most criticized player in NBA history.  This criticism goes no farther than James’ 3-6 NBA Finals record.\n\nDefending LeBron James’ NBA Finals Losses\n\nLeBron James’ Three Finals Wins\n\nJames has been successful throughout his career, and winning three championships is no small feat. Two of these, 2013 and 2016, were both game seven wins where James played outstanding.  He has also been the finals Most Valuable Player every time. The highlight though was coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors, led by unanimous Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Six Finals Losses\n\n2007: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nLeBron’s 3-6 finals record is not very good, only winning one-in-three of his trips made to the NBA Finals. However, he has also had some of the worst luck in history. In his first appearance back in 2007, James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers at 23 years old.\n\nThe King would run into the San Antonio Spurs at their peak. The Cavaliers were low on experience, were not nearly matching the talent, and also were severely out-coached.  Nobody expected them to even make the finals, so James really overachieved this season.\n\n2011: Dallas Mavericks: 4, Miami Heat: 2\n\nOh, the “LeChoke” series. LeBron James averaged 18 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, and for him, that is terrible. There really is no defending James here specifically, but it is unfair that he catches all the flak.\n\nDirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks swept Kobe Bryant’s two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant, too, would not play very well. The Mavericks would also follow up that series by taking out Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook in five games.\n\n2014: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Miami Heat: 1\n\nThis series was one of the many James versus a super team series. Not only did he have to deal with the monstrous defense of Kawhi Leonard, but he would also face Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker. James led the series in points per game by ten points, averaging 28 points, eight rebounds, and four assists.\n\nJames had little help, as Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were both showing early signs of age and were struggling mightily this series. The Miami Heat had a thin bench, and the Spurs bench was maybe the best in the league. No Miami players performed well, and the Spurs were excellent outside of even their best players. James was outmatched and faced a double-team against multiple excellent defenders.\n\n2015: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 2\n\nThis was the first win of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, and the first season James returned to Cleveland. This series should have been won by Cleveland as they were better, but they were all injured. Before the playoffs, Brian Windhorst reported that LeBron James had five different injuries. James had already dealt with a lower back injury earlier in the season.\n\nObviously, the real reason that the Cavaliers did not come away with the title was the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Love suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Boston Celtics in the first round. Irving would fracture his kneecap in game one of the NBA Finals.\n\nJames would play like a monster, leading each team in every statistical category. He led every game in points scored except for game four and led the game in rebounds three out of the six games. James averaged 36 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for the series. This is a forgotten performance in the long biography of James’ NBA Finals appearances.\n\n2017: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 1\n\nRound three of the Cavaliers versus Warriors war was heavily favored to the Warriors. Golden State signed Kevin Durant on July 4th, 2016 after blowing a 3-1 lead to Cleveland a month prior.  This was viewed as a move that locked the Warriors in as 2017 champions. It was heavily believed that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green would walk through the season. This was correct, as they went 16-1 in the playoffs.\n\nJames, despite playing like a monster, was heavily outmatched. He averaged 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, but nothing he did could have been enough. The Warriors were too good, and there was not much to be done about it.\n\n2018: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nPrior to these finals, it is worth noting that many expected the Toronto Raptors to be the team to lose to the Warriors in 2018. James had one of the worst supporting casts in his career. He would lead the entire playoffs in both points and assists. James was the only player on the Cavaliers to score 20+ points in the first round but still won the series. The next round he would sweep the Raptors in the famous “LeBronto” series. James would single-handedly beat a very deep Celtics team, a team that was much better coached. Every team James and the Cavaliers faced were better than them, but James simply played the best basketball of his career.\n\nRound four, the conclusion of the Cavaliers versus Warriors finals, saw a clean sweep. Kyrie Irving was gone, the Warriors were the same, and James had no arsenal. This series’ highlight is George Hill missing a free throw with J.R. Smith thinking Cleveland was up one. James actually visibly called a timeout, but like usual, got no help from the referees. After this move, it looked like the end. James had dominated, but the overtime saw Golden State take over. When LeBron James scores 51 points while adding eight rebounds, and you lose, there is no hope.\n\nJames averaged 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists. The most impressive is the 10 assists though, as that means James’ teammates actually made more than 10 shots.  Basically, this was the worst supporting cast in memory. If James won this series, he would have been the undeniable GOAT.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nChris Gallagher\n\nShare:\n\nMore Posts\n\nMore Details Emerge Why Denver Dismissed Malone & What’s Next for The Nuggets?\n\nJust like when Memphis relieved Taylor Jenkins from his duties on March 8, there appeared to be an uproar or surprise at the Denver Nuggets\n\nHow Concerning is Jaylen Brown’s Injury?\n\nBoston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is currently dealing with a knee injury.

The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics (64–18) played the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls (72–10), with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The teams' 136 combined regular season wins shattered the previous record of 125, set in 1985 between the Los Angeles Lakers who won 62 games and the Boston Celtics who won 63 games in the past regular season. The series, the 50th NBA finals in league history, was played under a best-of-seven format. This was the first championship in the Chicago Bulls' second three-peat.[1]\n\nChicago won the series 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP, his fourth time winning the award.\n\nBackground\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls were coming off a season where they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Orlando Magic. Heading into the upcoming season, Chicago was no longer the same team as they were in their most recent championship season of 1993, having lost key members of their first three-peat core in John Paxson and Bill Cartwright who retired while  Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Will Perdue, and Scott Williams left via free agency.\n\nIn their place was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But perhaps their biggest addition to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran who had been a rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.\n\nThe result of this ensemble was perhaps the greatest regular season of any team in NBA history at the time, as the Bulls won a record-high 72 games, which would be broken by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015–16 season. They continued to gain momentum in the playoffs, beginning with a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round, followed by a five-game defeat of the New York Knicks in the second round. The conference finals was a rematch of the previous season's series with the Orlando Magic, but it was a no-contest, as the Bulls swept the Magic to gain entry into the Finals.\n\nSeattle SuperSonics\n\nThe SuperSonics were led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, with George Karl as head coach. The team was considered a perennial title contender throughout the mid-1990s, but the closest they came to reaching the finals was in 1993, when they lost to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nTwo straight first-round exits followed, including the stunning 1994 loss to the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets (the Sonics were the first seed in that playoffs). Motivated by a successive string of early playoff losses, Seattle finished the 1996 regular season with a franchise-record 64 wins.\n\nSeattle began its playoff run with a four-game win over the Sacramento Kings, followed by a dominant sweep of the defending champion Houston Rockets, headed by a 33-point win in Game 1 where they held Hakeem Olajuwon to 5 points. They then beat the Utah Jazz in seven games in the western finals to advance to its first NBA championship round since 1979.\n\nRoad to the Finals\n\nSeattle SuperSonics(Western Conferencechampion) |

offensively, they were able to compensate with superb defense. Frustration set in for Seattle when Frank Brickowski was ejected after committing a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman, then promptly getting charged with two consecutive technical fouls. Chicago was leading by only 2 at the end of the third quarter, but in the final quarter, shots by Toni Kukoč and 2 key steals by Ron Harper clinched the Bulls' Game 1 win. Shawn Kemp was a bright spot for Seattle, scoring 32 points, but ended up fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 28 points, while Scottie Pippen chipped in with 21 points. Seattle captain Nate McMillan ended up leaving the game due to a debilitating back injury in the 2nd quarter. Dennis Rodman pulled down 13 rebounds for the Bulls, while Toni Kukoč chipped in off the bench with 18 points.\n\nGame 2\n\nNBC\nJune 79:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics88,Chicago Bulls92\nScoring by quarter:27–23, 18–23, 20–30,23–16\nPts:Shawn Kemp29Rebs:Shawn Kemp13Asts:Payton,Schrempf3 each |  | Pts:Michael Jordan29Rebs:Dennis Rodman20Asts:Michael Jordan8\nChicago leads the series, 2–0\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T. Rush\nGame 2 started well for Seattle with a 27–23 first quarter lead. However, Seattle would once again lose the lead before halftime. Despite Shawn Kemp's 29 points and 13 rebounds, Chicago triumphed with a final score of 92 to 88. In the victory, Dennis Rodman tied an NBA Finals record with 11 offensive rebounds and made a clutch free throw near the end of the game to seal the Bulls victory. Michael Jordan once again led the Bulls with 29 points, while Shawn Kemp continued his strong play by scoring 29 points for Seattle.\n\nGame 3\n\nNBC\nJune 97:30 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls108,Seattle SuperSonics86\nScoring by quarter:34–16,28–22, 13–23,33–25\nPts:Michael Jordan36Rebs:Dennis Rodman10Asts:Scottie Pippen9 |  | Pts:Detlef Schrempf20Rebs:Brickowski,Payton7 eachAsts:Gary Payton9\nChicago leads the series, 3–0\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nThe Sonics, owners of a 44–5 home record (including playoffs),[2] suffered a 22-point blow-out in their return to Seattle, giving the Bulls a seemingly insurmountable 3–0 series lead. Frustration would once again set in for the Sonics, as Frank Brickowski was ejected for committing a flagrant foul on Dennis Rodman.

In an attempt to spark his team, Coach George Karl gave Jordan's defensive assignment to Gary Payton, a move which showed immediate results.[3] Seattle succeeded with a 107–86 win over the Bulls, and Sonics fans taunted the Bulls players with homemade signs reading \"Sweepless in Seattle\".[4] The Sonics were helped by the return of team captain Nate McMillan whose presence entering the game brought the KeyArena crowd to its feet.\n\nSeattle's victory prevented the NBA Finals from being swept in two consecutive years (something which, as of 2024, has never occurred).[5]\n\nGame 5\n\nNBC\nJune 149:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls78,Seattle SuperSonics89\nScoring by quarter:18–18, 24–25, 18–19, 18–27\nPts:Michael Jordan26Rebs:Dennis Rodman12Asts:Scottie Pippen5 |  | Pts:Gary Payton23Rebs:Shawn Kemp10Asts:Gary Payton6\nChicago leads the series, 3–2\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T.

It just took too long. We should have come with this a little earlier.\"[6] Shawn Kemp's performance in this game was considered by many to be his best in a Seattle uniform.\n\nGame 6\n\nNBC\nJune 167:30 pm\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics75,Chicago Bulls87\nScoring by quarter:18–24, 20–21, 20–22, 17–20\nPts:Detlef Schrempf23Rebs:Shawn Kemp14Asts:Gary Payton7 |  | Pts:Michael Jordan22Rebs:Dennis Rodman19Asts:Michael Jordan7\nChicago wins the NBA Finals, 4–2\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nChicago won the series four games to two on Father's Day, in what would be the last time the Sonics played a Finals game before relocating to Oklahoma City and being renamed the Thunder. The Bulls' victory was partly due to the stellar performance of power forward Dennis Rodman, who delivered a repeat of his Game 2 performance with 19 rebounds, tying his own NBA Finals record. Bulls star Michael Jordan finished the game with 22 points and collected his fourth Finals MVP.\n\nAs of 2024, no NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit, and only four teams have forced a Game 7 after dropping the first three contests: the New York Knicks (1951), Denver Nuggets (1994), Portland Trail Blazers (2003), and Boston Celtics (2023).[7][8]\n\nPlayer statistics\n\nGP | Games played | GS | Games started | MPG | Minutesper game\nFG% | Field-goalpercentage | 3P% | 3-point field-goalpercentage | FT% | Free-throwpercentage\nRPG | Reboundsper game | APG | Assistsper game | SPG | Stealsper game\nBPG | Blocksper game | PPG | Pointsper game |  | \nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nRandy Brown | 6 | 0 | 8.2 | .500 | .500 | .500 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 2.8\nJud Buechler | 6 | 0 | 5.6 | .222 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.7\nRon Harper | 6 | 4 | 19.3 | .375 | .308 | .917 | 2.3 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 6.5\nMichael Jordan | 6 | 6 | 42.0 | .415 | .316 | .836 | 5.3 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.2 | 27.3\nSteve Kerr | 6 | 0 | 18.8 | .303 | .182 | .857 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 5.0\nToni Kukoč | 6 | 2 | 29.5 | .423 | .313 | .800 | 4.8 | 3.5 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 13.0\nLuc Longley | 6 | 6 | 28.3 | .574 | .000 | .727 | 3.8 | 2.2 | 0.6 | 1.8 | 11.7\nScottie Pippen | 6 | 6 | 41.3 | .343 | .231 | .708 | 8.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 1.3 | 15.7\nDennis Rodman | 6 | 6 | 37.5 | .486 | .000 | .579 | 14.7 | 2.5 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 7.5\nJohn Salley | 5 | 0 | 3.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nBill Wennington | 6 | 0 | 7.0 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.9\nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nVincent Askew | 4 | 0 | 15.5 | .222 | .200 | 1.000 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 1.8\nFrank Brickowski | 6 | 3 | 11.3 | .222 | .200 | .000 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.8\nHersey Hawkins | 6 | 6 | 38.3 | .455 | .273 | .923 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 0.2 | 13.3\nErvin Johnson | 3 | 3 | 6.7 | .333 | .000 | .000 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 1.3\nShawn Kemp | 6 | 6 | 40.3 | .551 | .000 | .857 | 10.0 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 2.0 | 23.3\nNate McMillan | 4 | 0 | 12.8 | .429 | .600 | 1.000 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 2.8\nGary Payton | 6 | 6 | 45.7 | .444 | .333 | .731 | 6.3 | 7.0 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 18.0\nSam Perkins | 6 | 0 | 31.7 | .377 | .235 | .810 | 4.7 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 11.2\nSteve Scheffler | 4 | 0 | 2.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDetlef Schrempf | 6 | 6 | 39.7 | .443 | .389 | .875 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 16.3\nEric Snow | 6 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDavid Wingate | 6 | 0 | 8.0 | .500 | .500 | 1.000 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.5\nBroadcasting\n\nThe Finals was aired in the United States on NBC. Bob Costas hosted the pre-game, halftime and post-game show with analysts Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey. Games were called by Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton, while Ahmad Rashad and Hannah Storm served as sideline reporters.\n\nThe local NBC stations of the participants were WMAQ-TV (Chicago) and KING-TV (Seattle).\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 1996 NBA Finals would be the last Finals appearance of the Seattle SuperSonics. The Sonics would win the Pacific Division again in 1997 and 1998, but fell in the second round of the playoffs each time. The series was George Karl's only Finals appearance in his coaching career. In 2008, the Sonics franchise moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. They would make the finals four years later after the move, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.\n\nThis was also the last time a Seattle-based team played for a major professional sports championship until Super Bowl XL in 2006, when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Seahawks would go on to handily defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and lose to the New England Patriots the following year in Super Bowl XLIX. In terms of overall sports leagues, the city would later enjoy six additional championships: the WNBA's Seattle Storm, a one-time SuperSonics sister team, won the 2004, the 2010, the 2018, and the 2020 WNBA Finals, and the MLS's Seattle Sounders FC won 2016 MLS Cup and 2019 MLS Cup.\n\nTeams from Chicago and Seattle would meet three more times in postseason competition among the \"Big Four\" leagues. The only time Seattle won over Chicago was in the 2000 American League Division Series, when the Seattle Mariners swept the Chicago White Sox 3–0. Meanwhile, the Seahawks lost to the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of both the 2006 and 2010 NFL playoffs.\n\nThe Bulls came close to winning 70 games for the second straight year, instead settling for a 69-win campaign in 1997. They won their second straight title over the Utah Jazz in six games of the 1997 NBA Finals. In the off-season that preceded Scottie Pippen became the first person to win the NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics.[9] The Bulls would also defeat the Utah Jazz in six games in the 1998 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls' combined 87 wins in the regular season and postseason would stand as an NBA record until the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, coached by former Bull Steve Kerr, broke it with 88 total wins (thanks to the first round using a best-of-7 format instead of the best-of-5 in 1996), including a 73–9 regular season mark. However, the Warriors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, failing to repeat as champions after beating the same Cavaliers in the previous Finals.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and
