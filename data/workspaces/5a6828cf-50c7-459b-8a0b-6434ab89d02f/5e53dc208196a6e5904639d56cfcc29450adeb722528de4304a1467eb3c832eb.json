He won six championships with the Bulls and led the team to two titles with three goals each. Jordan won his first championship in 1991 against Magic Johnson and the Lakers. That was followed by two consecutive titles in 1992 against the Blazers and 1993 against the Suns.\n\nChampionship rings have been part of the culture since the first NBA Finals in 1947. It’s amazing that Michael Jordan has won six such rings. The value of a championship ring remains priceless to those who receive it, as it is a souvenir of those who have worked hard to win the championship.\n\nYou can’t compare a ring won by an NBA legend like Michael Jordan to an average NBA player. Championship rings won by classic NBA teams, like the ones mentioned above, are expensive. If you buy or inherit an NBA championship ring from a legendary team like the Chicago Bulls of 1996, Boston Celtics of 1986, Lakers of 2001, or Lakers of 1987, you have a mini-bench in your closet. For example, the Herald Sun reported that a 1996 NBA championship ring from a member of the Bulls was for sale on eBay for $29,923. It is better if the team in question has performed excellently in the year in which they have won the championship.\n\nAs the league’s leading scorer and MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year never had enough of his lightness like Michael Jordan. He played the regular season to tell other players that he was better than them and that if they were in the upcoming playoffs, he would catch up with them. His only goal at any point was to focus on winning a ring at the end of the season.\n\nWinning the championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994-95 was a big deal. A ring can cost between $20,000 and $300,000. It really depends on who wears the ring. Hakeem Olajuwon had a championship ring, which was certainly a great start.\n\nI compared the constant value and relative value of the four players in the postseason to show that Michael Jordan is separating himself from the others, and the three that separate him from the six rings that matter.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA gold medal, the others being Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson. Russell’s 11 championships are the most of any player in NBA history.\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. He did the job at both ends of the floor, leading the Chicago Bulls to eight rings in six seasons, two of which were three-goal throws. Jordan dominated the NBA from the start, finishing with a perfect 6-0 record in the Finals, which is unlikely to happen again given the nature and dynamics of the league.\n\nBill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Shaquille O’Neal. Kareem, Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and Horace Grant had a season in which he scored 16.2 points per game in the postseason.\n\nA look at the Robin factor from year to year shows that Jordan has not benefited in any form or form from distorted seasons. His six rings make up six of the highest seven scores. He’s the only player you can’t argue with in the team.\n\nOnly four players in NBA history who haven’t played for Boston have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships during his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs. Seven of Russell’s teammates in Boston had seven or more championships. Including Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7).\n\nNo more than a handful of senior members of staff carry this rare distinction, in addition, of course, to the triumvirate of six-time champions Jordan, Pippen and Phil Jackson. Capp’s legacy is defined by his membership of the Bulls’ elite club, which has won six NBA championship titles and a complete set of club championship rings.\n\nIn fact, Jordan had six finals MVPs to the other two or two plays. As for Russell, in his first two championship teams and in his last, it was obvious he wasn’t even the second best player on the team. He was the youngest player on a team full of Hall of Famers and a veteran in his prime.\n\nThe steal and the shot, if you will, but my favorite moment of the game was the call from NBC’s Bob Costas. It’s one of the most iconic calls of all time. It was part of what made the legend of Michael Jordan so powerful. When the Bulls didn’t have the ball, you knew MJ was going to find a way to change that.\n\nDespite the fact that his doubters claimed he was just a regular-season player and would never be able to lead the Bulls into the ring, no one heard one. He was able to enjoy the taste of fame and he never looked back.\n\nAt 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls (13, 1984-93, 1995-98), the Washington Wizards and a few others in 2001-03. Jordan’s greatest years came with the Bulls in the 1990s, when he led them to six championships and as many finals appearances in eight years. He recorded a remarkable number for a player who was nearly 40 years old (35 when he was in the twilight of his career with the Wizards).\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in all 82 games. In the postseason, he averaged 30.7 points, 49 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals as the Bulls lost just one game en route to the finals. In the final, the Bulls jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and the SuperSonics. But the Sonics retaliated with two straight wins, and Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\nThe tip of the ring has a characteristic emblematic shape, embellished with the Bulls logo, a red stone with golden trims and horns in the middle and synthetic diamond and stone rivets on the face. The ring is engraved with 10K on the inside of Jostens Manufacturers.\n\nPlayers Name | Michael Jordan\nHow Many Rings | 6\nDrafted By | Chicago Bulls\nWon Rings With | 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\nPlayers College | North Carolina\nPlayers Birthday | February 17, 1963\nHometown | Brooklyn, New York\nYear Drafted | 1984\nRound Drafted | 1\nPick Drafted | 3\nRELATED RINGS\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n"

Breaking down his NBA Finals runs\n\nBill Bender\n\nHow many championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nESPN's 10-part documentary, \"The Last Dance,\" concludes Sunday, chronicling the Chicago Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s and detailing the franchise's NBA championship runs with Michael Jordan.\n\nThe focus is on Jordan, who pushed the Bulls to those championship runs.\n\nThe full clip from #LastDanceMichael Jordan on Leadership. pic.twitter.com/vsQJpCnhfK\n\nMORE: Michael Jordan's six championship Bulls teams, ranked\n\nHow many NBA championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nJordan led the Bulls to six NBA championships from 1991-98. The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007. He has covered the College Football Playoff, NBA Finals and World Series for SN. Bender enjoys story-telling, awesomely-bad 80s movies and coaching youth sports.\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\n"

All Jordan cared about was championships. He had this one goal, a single point focus to win a ring at the end of the season. He played the regular season in a way that let the other players know that he was so much better than the rest of them and that when the playoffs came he was no match for them. He dominated in the playoffs, went 6-0 in the NBA finals, and never had to see a 7th game winning 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls in a stretch of 8 seasons.\n\nPlayer Full Name | Michael Jeffrey Jordan\nDate of birth | February 17, 1963\nDrafted by | Chicago Bulls\nDrafted Year | 1984, Round 1, Pick 3\nRings Count | 6 rings\nRings Years | 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998\nWon Championships with | Chicago Bulls\nHow many rings does Michael Jordan have?\n\nMichael Jordan has won 6 rings in all with the Chicago Bulls.

While his scoring ability often steals the spotlight, his defensive prowess should not be overlooked. Jordan was a tenacious defender who earned numerous awards and accolades for his efforts on that end of the court.\n\nJordan’s defensive abilities were apparent from the start of his career. As a rookie in the 1984-85 season, he averaged 2.4 steals per game and continued to improve as a defender over the next few seasons.

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

However, by the 2022-23 season, we see a more even distribution of three-point attempts across positions, with centers and power forwards contributing more from beyond the arc. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shift suggests that the NBA is moving toward a model where \"shooting bigs\" are becoming more common, while point guards are not necessarily relied upon as primary three-point shooters.\n\n3-Pointers by Team\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nStatistical Increases: The Modern NBA’s Offensive Explosion\n\nAcross all three seasons, there has been a noticeable increase in points, assists, and rebounds, with three-pointers seeing the most significant rise. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis trend underscores the growing emphasis on the three-point shot as a primary offensive weapon. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in these statistics is a testament to the evolution of the game, where teams are not only scoring more but also relying heavily on the three-point line to do so.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nComparing Generational Talents: Jordan, Curry, Jokic, and Green\n\nThe Future of the NBA: What’s Next?\n\n"

The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.\n\nArticle Details\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nReferences\n\nAlsasua, R., Lapresa, D., Arana, J., Anguera, M.T., & Garzón, B.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. INTRODUCTION Basketball is one of the most practiced sports in the world (Quispe, 2023) and research has traditionally focused on aspects such as training, biomechanics, health and injuries, and physiology (Amirnordin et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Shi & Wu, 2024). However, technical-tactical studies, carried out from systematic observation, have not been sufficiently developed (Remmert, 2003) to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of increasingly sophisticated data analysis software, combined with the development of rigorous methodological approaches, provided researchers the tools to prove or disprove numerous theories about basketball that, until then, lacked scientific credibility. A particularly prominent area of the current research in the field of basketball is the relationship between physiological demands and the technical-tactical performance that players develop (Figueira et al, 2022). The depth and sophistication of these interactions, directly related to creativity and intra-team coordination (Furley & Memmert, 2015), confirm that basketball, along with its underlying structures, is a complex system (Klostermann et al., 2018). This complexity of the game generates complex data when studied, which, if simplified and decomposed into measurable units, becomes easier to analyse (Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In the case of basketball, this \"simplification\" is the only way to validate associations and/or causal relationships that occur during the game and obtain behavioural structures and interactions between them, from a certain distance, that does not affect their development. In this complex game, the whole, which means the team, is more than the sum of its parts, hence the importance of understanding how different players interact and relate to each other. One of the main data analysis techniques to analyse complex interactions in sports is polar coordinate analysis applied to data collected through systematic observation (Anguera & Hernández-Mendo, 2015; Castañer et al., 2016, 2017). Polar coordinate analysis can be used to measure the spontaneous behaviour of players interacting in their natural environment from the perspective of a specific behaviour, known as focal behaviour, having been performed with a high degree of success in other team sports such as soccer (Maneiro & Amatria, 2018) or handball (Navarro et al, 2018). In this sense, this typology of analysis has proven to be an effective tool to decompose the complexity of the game (Lago & Anguera, 2002; Castellano & Hernández-Mendo, 2003; Perea et al., 2012; Robles et al., 2013). Its application to the study of several of the best athletes in the world from various collective sports disciplines (Castañer et al., 2016; Castañer et al., 2017; Maneiro and Amatria, 2018) has allowed researchers to obtain practical conclusions about what makes these players excellent and, in return, make recommendations to improve the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. However, polar coordinate analysis has not yet been tested in players with a specific demarcation such as shooting guards. Most of the research on shooting guards is based on different groups of players based on their position in the field between this specific demarcation and point guards, obtaining interconnected results, which in no case can be confirmed as definitive for this type of demarcation, that is, the data analysed is generally outside the specific context of the actions and tactical technical performance developed by these players (Gómez et al, 2007; Sampaio et al., 2008). On the other hand, the relationships that occur between players are usually viewed through a prism focused on their traditional role according to their position on the field. However, in today's basketball, where greater versatility is increasingly required from players, only three key positions (guard, forward and centre) are identified, according to Sampaio et al. (2006), leaving the shooting guard position diluted and integrated in a non-specific way as such. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 109 This happens since the traditional mission of the shooting guard is characterized by their permeability, being a driving force that helps the point guards to organize the game and raise the ball, as well as having mastered shots at all distances (outside, inside and free throws), an aspect that conditions him to be the team's highest scorer and the player with the greatest responsibility attacking. This is why his identification as such is not defined, since he shares the functions of point guard and small forward. In this sense, Fransen et al. (2016), in their study on leadership in sport, determine that the players with main rolls in the game are in a very beneficial spatial position that, in combination with their high tactical responsibilities, positions them as team leaders. Following this line, there are many current examples of great international players that play this position such as Stephen Curry, Luca Doncic or James Hardem, who have as role models players like Kobe Bryant, who had at the same time Michael Jordan as an idol to emulate, latter considered the best shooting guard of all time (Greer, 2023). Given the above, it is considered appropriate to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the best shooting guards of all time in his natural environment. This will be carried out through the study of his interactions between teammates and his executed technique, aiming to unequivocally and scientifically establish the elements that must be present in players who play or wish to play in this position that is so relevant in basketball. Applying a robust methodological approach, combined with in-depth multidimensional analysis of rigorously coded data, will help provide objective insights into how Michael Jordan interacts with his environment and makes him unique. The specific objective is to analyse Michael Jordan's technical skills in the NBA playoff final of the 1995-1996 season through his technical actions, his shoots and his relationship with his teammates. METHOD To carry out the development of the present research, the Observational Methodology (Anguera, 1979) has been applied. The research design, in accordance with Sánchez-Algarra and Anguera (2013), follows an Idiographic model –given that a single team is the unit of study–, a Tracking model –studying during the games that constitute the finals of the 1995-1996 playoffs–, and a Multidimensional model –due to the categories that form the dimensions constituting the observation instrument. The conducted observation has been guided by scientific criteria with total perceptiveness and as a non-participating observer. Participants/Sample The observational sampling conducted has been intentional (Anguera, et al., 2011) with the American professional basketball team Chicago Bulls during the development of the playoff finals for the NBA Champion title in the 1995-1996 season (in this season, the Chicago Bulls won 72 games, breaking the all-time record for most victories in a season, a record that lasted for 20 years). The videos used are publicly available television broadcasts that have been retrieved for the study. All offensive sequences developed by the team during the 6 games that make up the finals of that season –1995-1996– have been coded. The 521 coded offensive sequences consist of 4798 multi-events. Intersessional consistency has been ensured through the following elements: the same ball size, the same court dimensions, the same game time, the same players on the roster, and the same jersey assignments. Observation instrument The present research required the development of an ad hoc observation instrument –see Table 1– which drew from the following sources: the works of Alsasua et al. (2018) and Arroyo et al. (2022). The instrument adapted their contributions and included new dimensions –Player Position, Defensive System, and Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 110 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. Consequence– which will provide a solid foundation for addressing the research objective. The instrument is a combination of nested category systems in field formats –dimensions. These categories adhere to the premise of being exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Table 1.

Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 111 Recording and coding The data was recorded (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2014) using Lince software, version 1.2.1 (Gabin et al., 2012), achieving an intra-observer agreement value of .91. The obtained data is of type IV, i.e., concurrent and time-based (Anguera et al., 2011). Subsequently, two additional programs were employed. The first one was Gseq v5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011), through which sequential analysis of delays was conducted. Later, the program Hoisan, version 1.2 (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2012), was utilized. The data obtained from the previous software was entered and analysed for obtaining polar coordinates. Finally, for the representation of results, the ObserTools application (Rodríguez-Medina et al., 2021) was employed. Data quality The data collection was carried out by two graduates in Sports Science with extensive experience in the studied sport and the use of observational methodology. However, the observers received specific training for data collection in this study following the phases recommended by Anguera (2003). The primary observer recorded all sequences comprising the observational sampling, while the second observer recorded 16.7% of the total sample. The reliability of the obtained data was calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between nominal classifications where there is no order of ranking. GSEQ software version 5.1 was used for the calculation of this coefficient following the recommendations established by Bakeman & Quera (2011). The concordance index achieved by the primary observer was .91 (intra-observer agreement). Regarding the result of inter-observer agreement, it was higher than .86 in all games included in the study (game 1 = .93; game 2 = .87; game 3 = .94; game 5 = .88, game 6 = .87). Considering these concordance data, it can be stated that the agreement is almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977). Data analysis Two types of data analysis have been employed to address the stated objectives: synchronous analysis and diachronic analysis. Synchronous analysis through inferential statistics has been used to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria, using the Pearson chi-square statistic (χ²). This was done by applying the following formula: χ2 = ∑ [(𝐹 𝑖𝑗−𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗)2 𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑘 𝑖,𝑗=1 The computation of this statistic was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0. Regarding the diachronic analysis, polar coordinates analysis has been employed, which is a very recent typology of analysis in sports science (Anguera and Hernández-Mendo, 2015). Cochran's Zsum (1954) is the foundation and origin of this analysis technique, which applies and is based on the principle that the sum of N independent z scores is normally distributed, with Z = 0 and s = N. Thus, the statistic 𝑍sum = ∑ 𝑧 √𝑛 𝑚 𝑙 (where n is the number of delays), according to Sackett (1980), allows measuring the strength or associative consistency between different behaviours. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 112 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. The polar coordinates technique, developed by Sackett (1980) and later refined by Anguera (1997), is utilized to identify the relationships between behaviours. The technique involves one of these behaviours: the conditioning behaviour or focal behaviour and the remaining behaviours, which constitute the various dimensions of the observation instrument (conditioned behaviours). This analysis is performed both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (-1 to -5), resulting in a vector for each behaviour related to the focal behaviour, with a specific angle and radius. Based on the angle obtained by the vector, it can occupy one of the four quadrants or sectors that make up the polar coordinate. Depending on the quadrant the vector occupies, the activation or inhibition relationship between behaviours varies. In quadrant I, the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. In quadrant II, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the retrospective plane, while it is not in the prospective plane. In quadrant III, the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour in both the prospective and retrospective planes. Lastly, in quadrant IV, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the prospective plane, while it is not in the retrospective plane. RESULTS During Jordan's participation in the 6 games that make up the sample, he interacts with the ball a total of 536 times out of the team's total of 2996 interventions, accounting for 17.89% of the actions in the offensive play where the ball goes through his hands. Regarding the technical actions executed by Michael Jordan, the obtained results indicate the presence of significant differences (χ² = 163006; p < .001). Standout actions include dribbling –Drib– with 35.9%, Free-throw shooting –Lan– (11.9%), and Dribble –Bot– (12.6%), percentages superior in all cases to the results achieved by his teammates. On the other hand, RP –reception and pass– and Pas –pass– actions present lower percentage results compared to the rest of the teammates with 34.0% and 2.7%, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

Notably, the actions of TEs –Static Shot– (31.9%) and TAtR –Backward Jump Shot– with 15.9% stand out in this regard. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 113 Effectiveness Regarding shooting effectiveness, i.e., the success of making or missing the shooting action, the results obtained, when comparing the performances of Michael Jordan with the rest of his teammates, show significant differences (χ² = 1615, p < .001) in favour of Michael Jordan, presenting much higher shooting efficiency percentages than the rest of his teammates –Table 4. Table 4. Shooting effectiveness. Ineffective Effective Other players 54.1% 45.9% Michael Jordan 48.8% 51.2% There are no significant differences in Jordan's involvement and the moment of the game, nor between the moment and the effectiveness of the shot, nor between the moment and the effectiveness between games. Finally, the results obtained are presented regarding the associative analysis through the use of polar coordinates technique, where Michael Jordan is related to the rest of the players in the squad who participated in the different games played. For the development of this analysis, the focal behaviour J23 has been related to the rest of the categories that make up the dimension (J33, J91, J13, J07, J09, J25, J34, J08, J22, J30, J00, J53, and J35), as well as with itself (J23). This analysis aims to verify the relationship established between Michael Jordan and the rest of the teammates throughout the final phase. The results obtained (Table 5 and Figure 1) show the criterion category J23 (Michael Jordan) with a radius of 7.24 and an angle of 45 degrees in quadrant I, where the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. Also, the categories J25 (Steve Kerr), J22 (John Salley), J00 (Randy Brown), J34 (Bill Wennington), and J30 (Jud Buechler) are observed with radii of 5.96, 3.69, 3.02, 3.33, and 2.96, and angles of 223.63°, 230.61°, 259.26°, 226.63°, and 238.32° respectively, in quadrant III, where the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. Figure 1. Representation of the behavioural map establishing category J23 as the focal behaviour in relation to his teammates in the 1996 finals matches. DISCUSSION Following Anguera and Hernández-Mendo (2015), the effectiveness of observational methodology lies in its ability to conduct a diachronic analysis with type II and type IV data, meaning data that include an order and a time component. However, conventional synchronic statistical analyses are also relevant, seeking associations between dimensions that provide categorical data to meet the objectives established in match analysis (O’Donoghue, 2009). Regarding the technical actions performed by Michael Jordan, dribbling stands out as the most prominent. This technical action is characteristic of shooting guards, who, unlike point guards, not only have offensive construction responsibilities, but also play a role in breaking the repetitive dynamics of the attack and are players with a high degree of technical proficiency (Okazaki et al., 2004; De Rose et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007). Regarding his shooting performance, Jordan demonstrates a particular expertise in free throw shooting, with a very high success rate. In this regard, this proficiency, coupled with his publicly acknowledged dedication to practicing this technique after daily training sessions, is closely linked to dribbling, as through these one-on-one situations, he manages to draw personal fouls in his favour, and these situations end up leading to free throw attempts, proving to be a decisive performance factor in basketball (Csataljay et al., 2009; Paulauskas et al., 2018). On the other hand, concerning the type of shot Jordan executes most notable, it is the fadeaway. This shooting style became his signature move, not only due to its repetition as the team's offensive finish but also because of his accuracy in scoring. This shooting technique serves as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned dribbling technique. Jordan uses dribbling as a deceptive move or feint to create optimal space, combined with the slight distance gained from the defender when jumping backward, allowing for a higher likelihood of successful execution (Courel-Ibañez et al., 2017). Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 115 In this regard, considering Jordan's shooting efficiency during the finals, especially if we take into account the volume and relevance of his shots, it can be observed the significance of this player in the team's scoring success. The precision in field goals is a crucial factor in achieving success in a game, as these variables represent both individual and collective offensive effectiveness (García et al., 2013; Malarranha et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, professional basketball has undergone significant development and evolution in the game over the last decade, showcasing players with increasingly versatile profiles (Courel-Ibáñez et al., 2017; Mateus et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to update knowledge about performance profiles in young players with professional potential and assess their suitability for today's high-level basketball (Ibáñez et al., 2018). However, it is crucial not to overlook the qualities and capabilities of players who have left their mark on the history of international basketball, particularly in the NBA, where players often exhibit a higher degree of specialization in their game compared to other competitions (Paulauskas et al., 2018). CONCLUSIONS The objective set in this research was to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan in the NBA 1995-1996 playoff finals through his technical actions, shooting, and his relationship with his teammates. To address this objective, two types of analyses, synchronous and diachronic, have been employed, through which, based on the results obtained, the following conclusions can be reached: - Regarding his actions, dribbling stands out, as well as the execution of free throws, which are strongly related elements. Here, Jordan demonstrates excellent ball control and 1x1 skills, forcing defences to engage with more than one opponent and causing defensive personal fouls. - The type of shot he performs that stands out is the fadeaway, a shooting action strongly linked to 1x1 situations. This provides a wide variety of resources and solutions to different 1x1 and even 1x2 scenarios for this player, making defending him a very complex situation due to the unpredictability of his actions. - Jordan is a completely consistent player with effectiveness indices in his actions and a level of participation that remains constant during all four quarters of each game and throughout the six games that make up the NBA finals. - The relationship between Jordan and his teammates does not show significant results exclusively with himself. This is interpreted as a player with great adaptability who both includes his teammates and is included by them in the plays, and the results clearly identify the team as rotation or non-participative. These types of studies allow us to advance and better understand the game of one of the best basketball players in the world. This enables the replication of his actions and a deeper comprehension and appreciation of the evolution of this sport. Similarly, this study serves as guidance for coaches and players in developmental categories, where the specificity of the position is less emphasized, and a more versatile player profile is increasingly valued, capable of effectively participating in the entire development of offensive actions.

Consider one such debate: who is the NBA’s greatest of all time (henceforth referred to as the GOAT)? While social isolation has stripped NBA fans of a thrilling regular season finish and leaves large what-ifs surrounding what would certainly have been the most compelling postseason in the better part of 10 years, it has amply fanned the flames of the old GOAT argument. With no new basketball to consume, I, like many fans, have allowed myself to be consumed by discussing the GOAT across various social media platforms, on FaceTime calls with siblings, or even in appropriately socially distanced activities.\n\nMany of these discussions have come about as a consequence of the riveting docu-series “The Last Dance” (focusing on the Chicago Bulls of the 1980s and ‘90s). Surely no NBA fan can watch the drama of these Bulls teams without being drawn into the GOAT conversation by their singular star, Michael Jeffrey Jordan. No discussion of the GOAT can be taken seriously without the consideration of Michael Jordan, the legendary shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls. Frankly, the GOAT debate begins and ends here for a large portion of NBA fans, and for good reason. Michael Jordan’s individual and team accomplishments literally fill books, and those accolades do not account for his cultural impact on basketball in the US and across the globe. Furthermore, his appeal and impact on a global level fail to do justice to the intensity of his individual preparation and competitive drive which inspired and elevated a generation of NBA All-Stars that followed in his footsteps.\n\nDespite all this, GOAT cases are made (legitimately) for players that came before and after Michael Jordan. Indeed, if the question was easily settled, there would be no debate. And yet, the debate rages on, with varying levels of rhetorical and analytical rigor but with all the fevered passion of a contest that has come down to the wire. The purpose of this report is to approach the GOAT conversation in a data-reinforced manner. I look beyond traditional box score metrics to quantify Michael Jordan’s case for the GOAT, though my own analytical biases will inevitably arise.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make the case for Michael Jordan as the NBA’s GOAT, beginning with a suitable data set is critical. In the case of MJ, I did not find it sensible to compare him to every NBA player that has ever played because (no disrespect) he would simply outshine most of them to an enormous extent. Moreover, the field of potential GOAT candidates has been whittled down over time to a relative handful of players (48 in the case of my data set) by people who form the NBA’s All-Decade teams. These teams are comprised of the greatest players in the 1980, ’90s, and so on until present. I considered only the All-Decade teams from the 1980s until the 2010s because 1) data and advanced statistics for previous players were inconsistently available, 2) the introduction of the 3-point line in 1979 skews scoring statistics from before this time period, and 3) Michael Jordan either played against or inspired the players on this list (often both).\n\nIn terms of the data set’s composition, I chose to shy away from traditional box score or “counting” statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) in favor of more “advanced” metrics. One of the issues with sports data is high levels of correlation between variables. For example, a player who scores a lot of points may also rebound a lot and have a high number of assists, all because they happen to be on the court for a large portion of the game. Having high correlation between your variables is like listening to a song with two guitarists: you may like the sound overall, but it is hard to tell which of the two guitarist is making “more” of the sound you like. Similarly, if we are trying to measure the impact of one variable or another, if they are highly correlated, we may not be able to tell which variable is the most impactful, which can lead to unreliable results when attempting to analyze the data.\n\nPart of the solution to this problem is to use advanced metrics, which are designed to combine and adjust more traditional measures to create measures that take some of the correlation problems out of a data set and also give more insight into a player’s impact on the game. Some of the advanced metrics included in this data set are described below (mostly paraphrased from basketball-reference.com’s excellent glossary):\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating — a combination of various counting statistics that essentially counts a player’s positive and negative statistical contributions, adjusts them for the pace of the game, and compares each individual to the league average in order to determine efficiency.\n\nUsage Rate — an estimate of the percentage of team’s plays that an individual player used.\n\nBox Plus/Minus — an estimate of how many points a player contributed above a league-average player on a league average team. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nWin Shares — an estimate that assigns a “share” of each team win to each player based on that player’s contribution to the win. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage — a measure of shooting efficiency based on shot type.\n\nFree Throw and Three Point Rates — these rates are measures of offensive efficiency, measuring and-1 free throws and the proportion of field goal attempts from three-point range.\n\nInitial Visualizations and Observations\n\nTo begin analyzing the data, I decided to take a look at plots that detail some of the attributes that make a player truly great. The first of these is a scatter plot comparing usage and efficiency, color coded by decade and sized by win shares. Why might usage and efficiency be an interesting comparison? Well, because there is generally a trade off between the two. Typically, a player that is used more is less efficient (think more turnovers, more missed shots, etc.). Conversely, a highly efficient player may appear more efficient because they are not used at a high rate. With that trade off scenario in mind, take a look at the following plot, comparing the usage and efficiency of the All-Decade teams:\n\nA few things stand out. First, with these GOAT candidates, there is hardly any evidence of a trade off between usage and efficiency. If anything, there is a positive correlation, meaning higher usage is related to higher efficiency. I take this as evidence of the greatness of all these players. Second, there is a noticeable difference in the distribution of players in some decades: those in the 1980s tended to be more in the lower left corner up through the center of the plot, while players in the 2010s seem to drift from center up toward the upper right corner. While there are several interpretations for this, I tend to think the emphasis on making the game “more” efficient in recent years can explain this trend. Despite that trend, however, the final point is the most striking to me: Michael Jordan is the most highly used and the most efficient of all the players in the data set and he has among the highest win shares to boot. If you were looking for one player that you could use again and again and again and still get efficient results at a historical level, look no further than MJ.\n\nThe next two charts are somewhat similar in that they look at a player’s impact on the defensive and offensive aspects of the game. I took win shares per 48 minutes and box plus/minus, broke them down into their offensive and defensive components, and plotted the players to show what end of the floor each player impacted the most.\n\nHere, the results match intuition to a large degree. Perennial defensive stalwarts like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are firmly in the high defense, low offense corner of the graphs, whereas prolific offensive players like Adrian Dantley and Steve Nash drift out more toward the high offense and low defense corner. Who occupies the coveted high offense, high defense corner, you ask? Who else? While David Robinson and LeBron James both edge into the realm, Jordan represents the pinnacle of a player who impacts the game at an elite level on both ends of the floor. Combine this with his best-in-class efficiency and usage rates, and his case for the GOAT solidifies.\n\nFactor Analysis — Drawing the GOAT with math\n\nDespite the evidence presented above, it is important to remember that those comparisons of usage versus efficiency and offensive versus defensive prowess are ones that I came up with, and therefore, they reflect my biases about what the GOAT should look like. Instead, factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) allows us the opportunity to mathematically determine a few “factors” (combinations of variables) that best describe the data set. In other words, factor analysis can be a way to check if our intuition about what factors are important in determining who the GOAT is. Running a factor analysis on this data set, we have the following three factors:\n\nThere are a few important things to break down here. First, the way to read the three factor columns is to look for the largest numbers in each column and see which variables they correspond with. Doing this, we might say that factor 1 emphasizes the importance of offensive efficiency, while factor 2 emphasizes defense, and factor 3 emphasizes usage. This reading of the factors somewhat reinforces my intuition of what attributes are important in determining the GOAT.\n\nSecond, the little red box at the bottom of the table indicates how much of the variation in the data set can be explained by the three factors above, about 65%. That means there is still about 35% of the differences between these players that cannot be explained by the data included in these factors. That is not surprising, and it is certainly a good reminder that these comparisons I shared should be taken with a grain of salt. However, there is at least some evidence that looking for an elite two-way player with high usage and high efficiency will get you on a suitable path for determining the GOAT.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these numbers and charts will do nothing to settle the debate over the GOAT once and for all, they certainly provide strong evidence for Michael Jordan. He occupies a nearly untouchable statistical echelon in terms of being a highly used and highly efficient player who dominates on both ends of the floor, even when compared to the best players from the last 40 years of NBA basketball. Doubtless, there are many ways to slice and dice this debate, but if anything, these findings make clear that any other competitor for GOAT is playing on MJ’s home court, and it’s his ball.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPublished in The Sports Scientist\n\nIn depth view of the world of Sports through the lens of Data Science, and Analytics\n\nWritten by Trevor Ram\n\nWriting about things I want to write about\n\nNo responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

It’s a topic that always sparks debate, so I figured I’d dig into the stats and the context to see what I could find. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a ride.\n\nFirst things first, I had to gather the data. I started by hitting up the usual suspects: Basketball-Reference, ESPN, *. I was looking for game logs, series results, player stats – the whole shebang. I spent a good chunk of the morning just sifting through all that information. Copy-pasting into a spreadsheet, you know the drill. It wasn’t pretty, but it had to be done.\n\nRelated posts\n\nWhat makes the Scoot Henderson shoe unique on the court?

This is where the fun really begins, right? Wrong! It’s tedious as heck. Removing duplicates, standardizing player names, making sure the dates lined up. Hours vanished into the abyss. But hey, garbage in, garbage out, so I powered through.\n\nNext, I wanted to understand the context of each Finals loss. It’s not enough to just look at the scores. Who were the opponents? Were there any major injuries? What was the team dynamic like? I dove into old articles, blog posts, even some YouTube highlights to get a better feel for what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nNow for the analysis. I looked at LeBron’s individual performance in those losses. Points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting percentages – the whole nine yards. I compared his stats to his regular season averages, and to his performance in winning Finals series. I was trying to see if there were any consistent patterns or differences.\n\nThen I shifted my focus to his teammates. How did they perform in those losing efforts? Were they stepping up, or were they struggling? I looked at their scoring, their defense, their overall contribution to the team. I was trying to figure out if LeBron was carrying the team, or if there were other factors at play.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t ignore the opposing teams. Who were the key players? What were their strengths and weaknesses? What was their game plan for stopping LeBron? I broke down their defensive strategies, their offensive schemes, and their overall team chemistry.\n\nAfter all that digging, I started to form some conclusions. It became clear that LeBron’s Finals losses weren’t always about him. Sometimes, he was just outmatched by a better team. Sometimes, his teammates didn’t provide enough support. And sometimes, it was just plain bad luck.\n\nI know some people will say that LeBron’s Finals record is a black mark on his legacy. But I think it’s important to remember that he’s faced some incredibly tough competition over the years. He’s gone up against some of the greatest players and teams in NBA history. And he’s always given it his all.\n\nSo yeah, that’s my journey through LeBron’s Finals losses. It was a lot of work, but I learned a ton. And hopefully, it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to win at the highest level.\n\nRuud vs Cerundolo Prediction: Key Stats and Insights\n\nAre you searching for the surreal crossword clue answer?

James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

Since 2011\n\nLebron James: In Defense of Six Finals Losses\n\nThough LeBron James has become synonymous with the NBA Finals, ever since left the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010, he has become the most criticized player in NBA history.  This criticism goes no farther than James’ 3-6 NBA Finals record.\n\nDefending LeBron James’ NBA Finals Losses\n\nLeBron James’ Three Finals Wins\n\nJames has been successful throughout his career, and winning three championships is no small feat. Two of these, 2013 and 2016, were both game seven wins where James played outstanding.  He has also been the finals Most Valuable Player every time. The highlight though was coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors, led by unanimous Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Six Finals Losses\n\n2007: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nLeBron’s 3-6 finals record is not very good, only winning one-in-three of his trips made to the NBA Finals. However, he has also had some of the worst luck in history. In his first appearance back in 2007, James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers at 23 years old.\n\nThe King would run into the San Antonio Spurs at their peak. The Cavaliers were low on experience, were not nearly matching the talent, and also were severely out-coached.  Nobody expected them to even make the finals, so James really overachieved this season.\n\n2011: Dallas Mavericks: 4, Miami Heat: 2\n\nOh, the “LeChoke” series. LeBron James averaged 18 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, and for him, that is terrible. There really is no defending James here specifically, but it is unfair that he catches all the flak.\n\nDirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks swept Kobe Bryant’s two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant, too, would not play very well. The Mavericks would also follow up that series by taking out Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook in five games.\n\n2014: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Miami Heat: 1\n\nThis series was one of the many James versus a super team series. Not only did he have to deal with the monstrous defense of Kawhi Leonard, but he would also face Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker. James led the series in points per game by ten points, averaging 28 points, eight rebounds, and four assists.\n\nJames had little help, as Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were both showing early signs of age and were struggling mightily this series. The Miami Heat had a thin bench, and the Spurs bench was maybe the best in the league. No Miami players performed well, and the Spurs were excellent outside of even their best players. James was outmatched and faced a double-team against multiple excellent defenders.\n\n2015: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 2\n\nThis was the first win of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, and the first season James returned to Cleveland. This series should have been won by Cleveland as they were better, but they were all injured. Before the playoffs, Brian Windhorst reported that LeBron James had five different injuries. James had already dealt with a lower back injury earlier in the season.\n\nObviously, the real reason that the Cavaliers did not come away with the title was the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Love suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Boston Celtics in the first round. Irving would fracture his kneecap in game one of the NBA Finals.\n\nJames would play like a monster, leading each team in every statistical category. He led every game in points scored except for game four and led the game in rebounds three out of the six games. James averaged 36 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for the series. This is a forgotten performance in the long biography of James’ NBA Finals appearances.\n\n2017: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 1\n\nRound three of the Cavaliers versus Warriors war was heavily favored to the Warriors. Golden State signed Kevin Durant on July 4th, 2016 after blowing a 3-1 lead to Cleveland a month prior.  This was viewed as a move that locked the Warriors in as 2017 champions. It was heavily believed that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green would walk through the season. This was correct, as they went 16-1 in the playoffs.\n\nJames, despite playing like a monster, was heavily outmatched. He averaged 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, but nothing he did could have been enough. The Warriors were too good, and there was not much to be done about it.\n\n2018: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nPrior to these finals, it is worth noting that many expected the Toronto Raptors to be the team to lose to the Warriors in 2018. James had one of the worst supporting casts in his career. He would lead the entire playoffs in both points and assists. James was the only player on the Cavaliers to score 20+ points in the first round but still won the series. The next round he would sweep the Raptors in the famous “LeBronto” series. James would single-handedly beat a very deep Celtics team, a team that was much better coached. Every team James and the Cavaliers faced were better than them, but James simply played the best basketball of his career.\n\nRound four, the conclusion of the Cavaliers versus Warriors finals, saw a clean sweep. Kyrie Irving was gone, the Warriors were the same, and James had no arsenal. This series’ highlight is George Hill missing a free throw with J.R. Smith thinking Cleveland was up one. James actually visibly called a timeout, but like usual, got no help from the referees. After this move, it looked like the end. James had dominated, but the overtime saw Golden State take over. When LeBron James scores 51 points while adding eight rebounds, and you lose, there is no hope.\n\nJames averaged 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists. The most impressive is the 10 assists though, as that means James’ teammates actually made more than 10 shots.  Basically, this was the worst supporting cast in memory. If James won this series, he would have been the undeniable GOAT.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nChris Gallagher\n\nShare:\n\nMore Posts\n\nMore Details Emerge Why Denver Dismissed Malone & What’s Next for The Nuggets?\n\nJust like when Memphis relieved Taylor Jenkins from his duties on March 8, there appeared to be an uproar or surprise at the Denver Nuggets\n\nHow Concerning is Jaylen Brown’s Injury?\n\nBoston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is currently dealing with a knee injury.

The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics (64–18) played the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls (72–10), with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The teams' 136 combined regular season wins shattered the previous record of 125, set in 1985 between the Los Angeles Lakers who won 62 games and the Boston Celtics who won 63 games in the past regular season. The series, the 50th NBA finals in league history, was played under a best-of-seven format. This was the first championship in the Chicago Bulls' second three-peat.[1]\n\nChicago won the series 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP, his fourth time winning the award.\n\nBackground\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls were coming off a season where they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Orlando Magic. Heading into the upcoming season, Chicago was no longer the same team as they were in their most recent championship season of 1993, having lost key members of their first three-peat core in John Paxson and Bill Cartwright who retired while  Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Will Perdue, and Scott Williams left via free agency.\n\nIn their place was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But perhaps their biggest addition to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran who had been a rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.\n\nThe result of this ensemble was perhaps the greatest regular season of any team in NBA history at the time, as the Bulls won a record-high 72 games, which would be broken by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015–16 season. They continued to gain momentum in the playoffs, beginning with a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round, followed by a five-game defeat of the New York Knicks in the second round. The conference finals was a rematch of the previous season's series with the Orlando Magic, but it was a no-contest, as the Bulls swept the Magic to gain entry into the Finals.\n\nSeattle SuperSonics\n\nThe SuperSonics were led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, with George Karl as head coach. The team was considered a perennial title contender throughout the mid-1990s, but the closest they came to reaching the finals was in 1993, when they lost to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nTwo straight first-round exits followed, including the stunning 1994 loss to the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets (the Sonics were the first seed in that playoffs). Motivated by a successive string of early playoff losses, Seattle finished the 1996 regular season with a franchise-record 64 wins.\n\nSeattle began its playoff run with a four-game win over the Sacramento Kings, followed by a dominant sweep of the defending champion Houston Rockets, headed by a 33-point win in Game 1 where they held Hakeem Olajuwon to 5 points. They then beat the Utah Jazz in seven games in the western finals to advance to its first NBA championship round since 1979.\n\nRoad to the Finals\n\nSeattle SuperSonics(Western Conferencechampion) |

offensively, they were able to compensate with superb defense. Frustration set in for Seattle when Frank Brickowski was ejected after committing a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman, then promptly getting charged with two consecutive technical fouls. Chicago was leading by only 2 at the end of the third quarter, but in the final quarter, shots by Toni Kukoč and 2 key steals by Ron Harper clinched the Bulls' Game 1 win. Shawn Kemp was a bright spot for Seattle, scoring 32 points, but ended up fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 28 points, while Scottie Pippen chipped in with 21 points. Seattle captain Nate McMillan ended up leaving the game due to a debilitating back injury in the 2nd quarter. Dennis Rodman pulled down 13 rebounds for the Bulls, while Toni Kukoč chipped in off the bench with 18 points.\n\nGame 2\n\nNBC\nJune 79:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics88,Chicago Bulls92\nScoring by quarter:27–23, 18–23, 20–30,23–16\nPts:Shawn Kemp29Rebs:Shawn Kemp13Asts:Payton,Schrempf3 each |  | Pts:Michael Jordan29Rebs:Dennis Rodman20Asts:Michael Jordan8\nChicago leads the series, 2–0\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T. Rush\nGame 2 started well for Seattle with a 27–23 first quarter lead. However, Seattle would once again lose the lead before halftime. Despite Shawn Kemp's 29 points and 13 rebounds, Chicago triumphed with a final score of 92 to 88. In the victory, Dennis Rodman tied an NBA Finals record with 11 offensive rebounds and made a clutch free throw near the end of the game to seal the Bulls victory. Michael Jordan once again led the Bulls with 29 points, while Shawn Kemp continued his strong play by scoring 29 points for Seattle.\n\nGame 3\n\nNBC\nJune 97:30 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls108,Seattle SuperSonics86\nScoring by quarter:34–16,28–22, 13–23,33–25\nPts:Michael Jordan36Rebs:Dennis Rodman10Asts:Scottie Pippen9 |  | Pts:Detlef Schrempf20Rebs:Brickowski,Payton7 eachAsts:Gary Payton9\nChicago leads the series, 3–0\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nThe Sonics, owners of a 44–5 home record (including playoffs),[2] suffered a 22-point blow-out in their return to Seattle, giving the Bulls a seemingly insurmountable 3–0 series lead. Frustration would once again set in for the Sonics, as Frank Brickowski was ejected for committing a flagrant foul on Dennis Rodman.

In an attempt to spark his team, Coach George Karl gave Jordan's defensive assignment to Gary Payton, a move which showed immediate results.[3] Seattle succeeded with a 107–86 win over the Bulls, and Sonics fans taunted the Bulls players with homemade signs reading \"Sweepless in Seattle\".[4] The Sonics were helped by the return of team captain Nate McMillan whose presence entering the game brought the KeyArena crowd to its feet.\n\nSeattle's victory prevented the NBA Finals from being swept in two consecutive years (something which, as of 2024, has never occurred).[5]\n\nGame 5\n\nNBC\nJune 149:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls78,Seattle SuperSonics89\nScoring by quarter:18–18, 24–25, 18–19, 18–27\nPts:Michael Jordan26Rebs:Dennis Rodman12Asts:Scottie Pippen5 |  | Pts:Gary Payton23Rebs:Shawn Kemp10Asts:Gary Payton6\nChicago leads the series, 3–2\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T.

It just took too long. We should have come with this a little earlier.\"[6] Shawn Kemp's performance in this game was considered by many to be his best in a Seattle uniform.\n\nGame 6\n\nNBC\nJune 167:30 pm\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics75,Chicago Bulls87\nScoring by quarter:18–24, 20–21, 20–22, 17–20\nPts:Detlef Schrempf23Rebs:Shawn Kemp14Asts:Gary Payton7 |  | Pts:Michael Jordan22Rebs:Dennis Rodman19Asts:Michael Jordan7\nChicago wins the NBA Finals, 4–2\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nChicago won the series four games to two on Father's Day, in what would be the last time the Sonics played a Finals game before relocating to Oklahoma City and being renamed the Thunder. The Bulls' victory was partly due to the stellar performance of power forward Dennis Rodman, who delivered a repeat of his Game 2 performance with 19 rebounds, tying his own NBA Finals record. Bulls star Michael Jordan finished the game with 22 points and collected his fourth Finals MVP.\n\nAs of 2024, no NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit, and only four teams have forced a Game 7 after dropping the first three contests: the New York Knicks (1951), Denver Nuggets (1994), Portland Trail Blazers (2003), and Boston Celtics (2023).[7][8]\n\nPlayer statistics\n\nGP | Games played | GS | Games started | MPG | Minutesper game\nFG% | Field-goalpercentage | 3P% | 3-point field-goalpercentage | FT% | Free-throwpercentage\nRPG | Reboundsper game | APG | Assistsper game | SPG | Stealsper game\nBPG | Blocksper game | PPG | Pointsper game |  | \nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nRandy Brown | 6 | 0 | 8.2 | .500 | .500 | .500 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 2.8\nJud Buechler | 6 | 0 | 5.6 | .222 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.7\nRon Harper | 6 | 4 | 19.3 | .375 | .308 | .917 | 2.3 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 6.5\nMichael Jordan | 6 | 6 | 42.0 | .415 | .316 | .836 | 5.3 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.2 | 27.3\nSteve Kerr | 6 | 0 | 18.8 | .303 | .182 | .857 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 5.0\nToni Kukoč | 6 | 2 | 29.5 | .423 | .313 | .800 | 4.8 | 3.5 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 13.0\nLuc Longley | 6 | 6 | 28.3 | .574 | .000 | .727 | 3.8 | 2.2 | 0.6 | 1.8 | 11.7\nScottie Pippen | 6 | 6 | 41.3 | .343 | .231 | .708 | 8.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 1.3 | 15.7\nDennis Rodman | 6 | 6 | 37.5 | .486 | .000 | .579 | 14.7 | 2.5 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 7.5\nJohn Salley | 5 | 0 | 3.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nBill Wennington | 6 | 0 | 7.0 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.9\nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nVincent Askew | 4 | 0 | 15.5 | .222 | .200 | 1.000 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 1.8\nFrank Brickowski | 6 | 3 | 11.3 | .222 | .200 | .000 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.8\nHersey Hawkins | 6 | 6 | 38.3 | .455 | .273 | .923 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 0.2 | 13.3\nErvin Johnson | 3 | 3 | 6.7 | .333 | .000 | .000 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 1.3\nShawn Kemp | 6 | 6 | 40.3 | .551 | .000 | .857 | 10.0 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 2.0 | 23.3\nNate McMillan | 4 | 0 | 12.8 | .429 | .600 | 1.000 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 2.8\nGary Payton | 6 | 6 | 45.7 | .444 | .333 | .731 | 6.3 | 7.0 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 18.0\nSam Perkins | 6 | 0 | 31.7 | .377 | .235 | .810 | 4.7 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 11.2\nSteve Scheffler | 4 | 0 | 2.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDetlef Schrempf | 6 | 6 | 39.7 | .443 | .389 | .875 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 16.3\nEric Snow | 6 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDavid Wingate | 6 | 0 | 8.0 | .500 | .500 | 1.000 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.5\nBroadcasting\n\nThe Finals was aired in the United States on NBC. Bob Costas hosted the pre-game, halftime and post-game show with analysts Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey. Games were called by Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton, while Ahmad Rashad and Hannah Storm served as sideline reporters.\n\nThe local NBC stations of the participants were WMAQ-TV (Chicago) and KING-TV (Seattle).\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 1996 NBA Finals would be the last Finals appearance of the Seattle SuperSonics. The Sonics would win the Pacific Division again in 1997 and 1998, but fell in the second round of the playoffs each time. The series was George Karl's only Finals appearance in his coaching career. In 2008, the Sonics franchise moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. They would make the finals four years later after the move, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.\n\nThis was also the last time a Seattle-based team played for a major professional sports championship until Super Bowl XL in 2006, when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Seahawks would go on to handily defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and lose to the New England Patriots the following year in Super Bowl XLIX. In terms of overall sports leagues, the city would later enjoy six additional championships: the WNBA's Seattle Storm, a one-time SuperSonics sister team, won the 2004, the 2010, the 2018, and the 2020 WNBA Finals, and the MLS's Seattle Sounders FC won 2016 MLS Cup and 2019 MLS Cup.\n\nTeams from Chicago and Seattle would meet three more times in postseason competition among the \"Big Four\" leagues. The only time Seattle won over Chicago was in the 2000 American League Division Series, when the Seattle Mariners swept the Chicago White Sox 3–0. Meanwhile, the Seahawks lost to the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of both the 2006 and 2010 NFL playoffs.\n\nThe Bulls came close to winning 70 games for the second straight year, instead settling for a 69-win campaign in 1997. They won their second straight title over the Utah Jazz in six games of the 1997 NBA Finals. In the off-season that preceded Scottie Pippen became the first person to win the NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics.[9] The Bulls would also defeat the Utah Jazz in six games in the 1998 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls' combined 87 wins in the regular season and postseason would stand as an NBA record until the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, coached by former Bull Steve Kerr, broke it with 88 total wins (thanks to the first round using a best-of-7 format instead of the best-of-5 in 1996), including a 73–9 regular season mark. However, the Warriors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, failing to repeat as champions after beating the same Cavaliers in the previous Finals.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and

This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

Revered by fans across continents, Jordan’s mastery on the basketball court and his pioneering role in sports marketing reshaped the NBA’s appeal, sneaker culture, and even how athletes engage with fans off the court. This article explores how Jordan revolutionized both basketball and the sportswear marketing industry, leaving an enduring influence on future stars, brand partnerships, and consumer expectations.\nAthletic Dominance and Pivotal Moments\nMichael Jordan’s six NBA championships, five MVP awards, and a string of iconic highlights (including “The Shot” and “The Flu Game”) cemented him as a singular talent. His flair for clutch performances made the Chicago Bulls must-watch entertainment, boosting television ratings and turning casual viewers into devoted followers.\nJordan’s relentless competitiveness and showmanship also encouraged his rivals to elevate their games. His style of play—combining mid-air acrobatics, fadeaway jumpers, and defensive tenacity—became the standard by which future superstars would be judged. Each dazzling dunk or buzzer-beater captured imaginations worldwide, fueling the notion that basketball could be as captivating and global as soccer or any other major sport.\nInternational Appeal and the 1992 Dream Team\nJordan’s impact went beyond American borders, particularly in 1992 when he led the U.S. “Dream Team” at the Barcelona Olympics. For many international viewers, that squad offered a first glimpse of NBA-caliber play, with Jordan at the forefront of the spectacle. Fans from Europe, Asia, and beyond quickly identified Jordan’s name with the pinnacle of basketball excellence. This exposure significantly accelerated the NBA’s global expansion, setting the stage for worldwide fan bases and paving the way for international stars to enter the league.\n\nImage Credits: Fadeaway\nA Revolutionary Partnership\nIn 1984, Nike signed Michael Jordan to a then-unprecedented rookie endorsement deal worth $2.5 million. The collaboration launched the Air Jordan 1 in 1985, featuring a striking red-and-black color scheme that clashed with NBA uniform rules and was initially “banned.” This controversy only heightened the line’s allure, sparking interest in both the shoes and Jordan’s charismatic persona. Over subsequent releases, each Air Jordan model introduced inventive design elements, ensuring each sneaker felt like a milestone in Jordan’s career.\n\nSource: Nike\nCultural Phenomenon and Economic Might\nThe Air Jordan brand grew into a fashion and cultural statement, blending basketball performance with street style. Limited-edition releases and retro reissues maintain feverish consumer demand, sometimes selling out in minutes. By 2024, the Air Jordan line exceeded $5 billion in annual revenue—an astonishing figure that underscores its ongoing relevance decades after Jordan retired from professional basketball.\nBeyond footwear, these partnerships shaped a new approach to athlete endorsements. Jordan wasn’t just a pitchman—he was at the creative core of the brand, influencing product aesthetics and storytelling. His synergy with Nike demonstrated that marketing a sneaker could transcend sport, appealing to fans of hip-hop, urban fashion, and mainstream pop culture.\n\nImahge Credits: Pintrest\nJordan’s Blueprint for Modern Athletes\nAthlete as a Brand\nPrior to Jordan, endorsements were generally transactional. Jordan proved an athlete could embody an entire brand identity, setting a precedent for names like LeBron James, Roger Federer, and Cristiano Ronaldo to negotiate deeper involvement in product design and marketing strategy. Rather than just modeling shoes in print ads, Jordan co-created an emotional narrative that connected each sneaker release to a significant moment, forging loyalty far beyond typical fan devotion.\nEmotional Storytelling and Authenticity\nFrom Gatorade’s “Be Like Mike” campaign to McDonald’s commercials, Jordan’s marketing leaned on emotional resonance and youthful aspiration. Fans saw him as the driven underdog who rose to dominance through relentless work ethic. Advertisers recognized the authenticity behind Jordan’s competitiveness, tapping into that emotional authenticity to inspire viewers. This approach turned every product endorsement into a mini storyline, bridging sports and personal motivation.\nWidening Paths for Future Stars\nJordan’s success paved the way for athletes to become brand ambassadors, partial owners, or co-creators of signature lines. High-profile partnerships like Kevin Durant’s KD brand with Nike or Serena Williams’s design input with her sponsors owe a debt to Jordan’s trailblazing. Modern superstars often emulate Jordan’s trajectory, blending on-field performance with off-field entrepreneurial ventures.\nSneaker Culture and Street Fashion: A Lasting Legacy\nAir Jordan in Streetwear\nWhen the Air Jordan 1 arrived, it crossed an invisible boundary—shoes once reserved for basketball courts suddenly became coveted lifestyle accessories. B-boys, skateboarders, and rap icons alike integrated Jordans into their wardrobes, turning them into cultural symbols of status and flair. This shift established a new trend: performance sneakers could be as much about self-expression as athletics.\nLimited Releases and the Resale Market\nThe brand leveraged scarcity to fuel excitement—limiting production runs or distributing special editions that collectors scrambled to acquire. This approach to hype marketing remains standard practice among modern sneaker releases and streetwear collaborations, such as Supreme or Off-White. Rare Jordan models command steep resale prices, illustrating how Jordan’s brand turned functional footwear into cultural artifacts.\nExpanding into a Global Business\nOver time, Jordan Brand partnerships extended beyond basketball, aligning with designers or celebrities for innovative lines. These collaborations continuously refresh the brand’s identity, engaging audiences that might never have watched an NBA game. Whether a sneaker drop features futuristic materials or references nostalgic colorways from Jordan’s Bulls era, each product taps into a sense of heritage and exclusivity.\n\nImage Credits: Newatlas\nSocial Activism and Evolving Criticism\nPhilanthropy and Social Involvement\nCritics once argued Jordan avoided political stances or activism during his prime. Later in life, he demonstrated a more overt philanthropic and social conscience, donating millions to initiatives focusing on youth education, racial equality, and community development. This shift parallels a broader expectation for high-profile athletes to leverage their platforms for social causes, reflecting how influential Jordan’s brand identity has become.\nEthical Manufacturing Concerns\nNevertheless, the success of Jordan’s brand, manufactured largely overseas, is not free from scrutiny. Nike’s supply chain controversies over labor standards occasionally surface in media discussions about exploitation in factories. This tension highlights the complexities big sportswear brands face—balancing brand equity, consumer demand, and corporate responsibility.\nMarketing Lessons from Michael Jordan’s Empire\nMichael Jordan’s transformation of both basketball and sportswear marketing offers essential insights for modern brands, entrepreneurs, and athletes:\n\nThe Power of Unique Partnerships\nBy co-developing products instead of merely endorsing, Jordan built enduring synergy. Modern athletes and brand owners can replicate this co-creation model for deeper consumer engagement.\n\n\nEmotional Narratives Create Loyalty\nFrom “Be Like Mike” to the story behind each Air Jordan release, emotional storytelling fosters a personal connection. Audiences relate to both success and struggle, turning consumer relationships into something more than just sales.\n\n\nPerformance Meets Style\nA brand can straddle athletic utility and street-fashion credibility. The momentum from Jordan’s on-court achievements lent authenticity to Air Jordans, propelling the shoes into everyday wardrobes.\n\n\nScarcity and Exclusivity\nLimited-edition sneakers or exclusive brand collaborations keep hype cycles rolling, demonstrating how well-managed scarcity can boost consumer intrigue and demand.\n\n\nEvolution While Preserving Heritage\nAlthough Jordan last played an NBA game in 2003, fresh sneaker releases, colorways, and brand collaborations keep interest alive for new generations. Balancing innovation with historical references fosters both nostalgia and modern appeal.\n\n\n\nHow Did Michael Jordan Impact the World?\nMichael Jordan’s influence transcends basketball, reshaping sports, culture, and global marketing in profound ways:\n\nRevolutionizing Basketball and Globalizing the NBA:\n    Jordan’s dominance on the court, including six NBA championships and iconic performances like “The Flu Game,” elevated the NBA to a global stage. His leadership in the 1992 Olympics with the U.S. “Dream Team” introduced millions of international fans to professional basketball, paving the way for the NBA’s expansion into global markets.\nTransforming Athlete Endorsements:\n    Michael Jordan redefined athlete endorsements by collaborating deeply with brands like Nike to co-create the iconic Air Jordan line. This partnership turned sneakers into a global fashion statement and set the blueprint for modern athlete branding, influencing stars like LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nBuilding Sneaker Culture and Streetwear:\n    Jordan’s Air Jordans broke boundaries, becoming both a basketball performance shoe and a cultural icon. His shoes shaped sneaker culture, blending sportswear with street style, and inspired an entire resale and collector’s market worth billions.\nInspiring Generations Through Emotional Storytelling:\n    Campaigns like Gatorade’s “Be Like Mike” and Nike’s emotional ads made Jordan an inspirational figure, symbolizing hard work, resilience, and excellence. His story of overcoming obstacles resonated globally, motivating countless individuals to pursue their dreams.\nDriving Social and Economic Change:\n    Jordan’s brand partnerships, philanthropic efforts, and business ventures have contributed billions to the global economy while supporting youth education, racial equality, and community development. His legacy continues to influence how athletes use their platform to effect social change.\n\nThe Enduring Importance of Jordan’s Influence\nMichael Jordan’s remarkable narrative—rising from an overlooked college athlete to a six-time NBA champion and multi-billion-dollar brand architect—represents the pinnacle of synergy between athletic success and savvy marketing. By presenting himself as both a fierce competitor and a relatable icon, Jordan bridged cultural gaps, extending basketball’s influence to areas of fashion, music, and broader entertainment. Furthermore, through strategic co-branding with Nike, Jordan established a template for athlete-driven product lines that many big names mirror today.\nFrom a marketing perspective, Jordan’s imprint looms over every subsequent sneaker hype, brand partnership, or athlete’s ambition to become a business powerhouse. Meanwhile, from a sports perspective, his blend of skill, competitiveness, and showmanship ushered in a new standard for professional basketball—and championed a global following that turned the NBA into a cultural export. This hybrid role, both on-court magician and off-court marketing genius, underscores the comprehensive impact Jordan had on shaping fans’ expectations of celebrity athletes.\nIn essence, Michael Jordan demonstrated the profound power of cohesive storytelling, authenticity, and consistent performance. His brand rests on more than highlight reels; it’s built on the ethos of excellence—a pursuit that resonates with fans of basketball and style enthusiasts alike. Today’s sports economy teems with athlete collaborations and signature lines, all traces of a legacy begun by a once-overlooked player who simply refused to accept defeat, whether in the final seconds of a championship game or in the competitive world of sports marketing.\nCheck Out Marketing Strategies of Other Companies\n\nRed Bull\nFenty Beauty\nLouis Vuitton\nAlo\nZara\nVictoria Secret\nAritizia\nTesla\nBMW\nMercedes-Benz\nPorsche\nFenty Beauty\nSony\nDuolingo\nAdidas\nNike\nMcdonald's\n\n\nDisclosure: This list is intended as an informational resource and is based on independent research and publicly available information.

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nBreaking Down Michael Jordan's NBA Legacy and Impact on the Game\n\nMichael Jordan meant more to basketball than six rings.\n\nHad someone like Shaquille O'Neal won those titles, it wouldn't have had the same impact. MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

For Alonso, his love for Michael Jordan and the Bulls was also personal. Again, just like in Peru, soccer was still the ultimate sport in the country and my first love, but the NBA, Jordan and the Bulls were once again the major influencers in '90s England, especially for young people. My immigrant story is a testament to this very notion: Michael Jordan and the '90s Chicago Bulls offered the worldânot just Americaâa new meaning to sports and superstardom.",

          "raw_content": "How Michael Jordan And the Bulls Inspired the World\nThe year is 1992. \nHere I am, a Peruvian kid in Lima, a city going through economical and internal conflict but alsoâand just like the rest of South Americaâwelcoming the initial effects of modern American culture. \nSaved by the Bell is reaching the heights of its popularity ,and even though itâs been almost year since its release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is still playing in movie theaters across the capital. \nMcDonalds were expanding across the city, right next to cevicherias, and everyone wanted G.I. Joe action figures for Navidad. \nThanks to developments in television streaming and market consumption, American products were placing an imprint all over the world, and it was no different in Peru. \nWe also felt the U.S. takeover in sports. Sure, soccer was still the absolute dominant national force, but thanks to the introduction of international cable, Peruvians were now also watching NBC and ESPN, and their fandom habits were diversifying. \nAnd this is when the NBA entered the party.\nIf you ask any Peruvian who grew up in the '90s, they will tell you that their memories, in one way or another, always came back to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Itâs hard to explain this to an American reader, but for South Americans, MJ opened a door that signified more than just basketball. It was as if we realized there was another way you could define an athlete and cultural icon.\nSo here we are, back in '92. I remember the moment so vividly.\nItâs May, less than a month away from my 11th birthday, and Iâm staying over at my close friend Alonsoâs house to watch Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals between the Bulls and my New York Knicks. (I had already made this decision based on my love for John Starks, my favorite player.) Itâs not official, but I am willing to bet my life savings that Alonso was also the biggest NBA fan in Peru at the time. He was obsessed with the game. Obsessed.\nMiguelito Jordan, as my dad called him, and his Bulls returning as the defending champions, are now doing something quite remarkable off the court.Â And this was being felt everywhere, even in Peru.\nI didnât know it at the time, but years later, when I started to work in the sports industry, I realizedÂ seeingÂ thatÂ specific Game 7 (Chicago won 110-81) and watching it with my friend essentially proved to me that sports was more than just a game. It was a cultural movement. And thatâs what Michael Jordan and the Bulls did for a chubby Peruvian kid in the '90s.\nThe '90s, you see, was not just a glorious time for the league in America. It was a pivotal moment for the world of sports because Miguelito was rewriting the way weâthe worldâlooked at superstars.\nI reached out to Alonso (Guzman) for this piece because I wanted to make sure my memories were more than just nostalgia. \nWithout a beat, he concurred. \nâHonestly, at the beginning of 1991, my life changed because I discovered basketball and the Bulls embellished my love for the sport,â says Alonso, now an illustrator and writer in Lima. âAnd even though itâs widely accepted that the Dream Team lifted the game to epic global proportions in â92, Iâd actually argue it was the '90s Bullsâalongside satellite TVâwho were responsible for the start of this phenomena. Especially where we grew up.â\nFor Alonso, his love for Michael Jordan and the Bulls was also personal. âWatching them became a means of bonding with my dad,â he says. âI remember how he used to talk about their great chemistry, the grace of Scottie Pippen, the strength of Horace Grant and later Dennis Rodman, the clutch play of John Paxson and later Steve Kerr. And as the seasons went by, we became one while watching their games, and even congratulated each other for a good job after every championship clincher. It was as if we were two of 'the guys'. And whenever I watched Phil Jackson on TV, I saw my dad: a throwback grey-haired man who was strict, but also very kind.\nâThe endless summer days in which I saw more hardwood than sun, all the ups and downs of the seasons (including the '93-'94 team) and that final Bulls salute after Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, when I embraced my dad in the same fashion as Jordan and Phil Jackson. We saw history together, and all those precious moments will remain with me forever.â\nAfter our conversation, he confessed to me that though this team was important to him, he didnât realize just how much the Bulls meant until he realized they were a connector, a bridge that united father and son. \nThe '93-'94 seasonâas any NBA fan remembersâcame with change like no other for many reasons. The Bulls were without MJ, and due to the fragility of the nation, my family and I left Peru for England. \nItâs not a surprise to say the culture shock changed me, and life in the United Kingdom transformed almost everything about me. Here I was, no longer a Peruvian, but now also an immigrant, having to acclimate myself to a new world, a new society and a distinctively different way of life.\nAt first, due to my basic knowledge of English, making friends was difficult. But one of the saving graces were my Air Jordan VII sneakers, my knowledge of U.S. pop culture and, most importantly, Michael Jordan. This immediately became a conversation starter, and slowly, piece by piece, I felt more comfortable in my new home. \nHave you ever seen Fresh Off the Boat? That was my lifeâthe Lima-to-London version. I was a foreigner in a new land using pop culture and sports as my Get Out of Jail passes. \nAgain, just like in Peru, soccer was still the ultimate sport in the country and my first love, but the NBA, Jordan and the Bulls were once again the major influencers in '90s England, especially for young people.\nChannel Four in England was the vehicle that introduced U.S. sports to British audiences. In the '80s, the network broadcasted the NFL and achieved success in viewership so the mid '90s was naturally a move for the NBA. Showing the '96-'97 season was a major step for the network. The deal to broadcast the league became the biggest move since making a similar agreement with Serie A soccer, also an incredibly popular league at the time. The show would be called NBA 24/7,Â and almost every single British teenager watched it religiously. \nThe year is now 1998. I am a junior in high school and fully accustomed to English life.  Jordan the Bulls are still iconic and heading to their sixth title. Most importantly, from a personal standpoint, his poster is still hanging on my wall, right next to my other sports hero Dwight Yorke (though his poster would come down the same year after leaving Aston Villa for Manchester United). \nIn England, the NBA didnât just attract the attention of young British fans, but it also represented minorities, especially the black British community. The NBA, therefore, appealed to people of color in England because, as mentioned earlier, it was more than just a sport; it was a symbol of cultural representation.\nâLike many teenagers growing up in London, a love of the NBA came from watching rap stars on MTV, and all I wanted to do was emulate their style, while rapping into a hairbrush in the mirror,â says James Chinery, now an English teacher and educator in Greater London. He is also a good friend from my college years. Like Alonso, James was influenced by U.S. cultureâespecially Jordan and the Bulls. âFirst, it was the Raiders cap and jacket, which were almost like school uniforms growing up in North London. Then quickly, the legend that was Michael Jordan took over the consciousness. Jordan trainers, t-shirts, hoodies, caps, posters on wallsâyou name it, we all wanted it.â\nJamesâs love for MJ and the Bulls elevated after subscribing to Slam Magazine and staying up until midnight to watch theÂ NBA 24/7 on Channel Four, and his overall view of the world changed because of this team. âMy daily cartoon drawings changed from black superheroes to street ball players,\" he says. \"But whatever I drew, they were wearing Jordans and a Bulls cap. To this day, I still religiously wear my AJ3âS when Iâm not at work.â\nMy immigrant story is a testament to this very notion: Michael Jordan and the '90s Chicago Bulls offered the worldânot just Americaâa new meaning to sports and superstardom. Their success sparked an international spectacle, idolized and adulated.\nAnd this Peruvian kid will never forget it.Â Â \nLuis Miguel Echegaray is a reporter, producer and head of Latino/Spanish content with Sports Illustrated.

In his 21-year career, LeBron James has never shown signs of slowing down. Looking at his recent seasons, it almost seems like he has just reached his peak.\nLeBron James entered the NBA as the first overall pick in the 2003 Draft, and from there, he became a four-time MVP and a perennial All-Star, ranking second in both All-Star selections and games played. He is the first player in NBA history to reach 30,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists—a record that will likely remain unbeaten for decades. Moreover, on February 8, 2023, he became the all-time leading scorer, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nThe debate over the greatest of all time has never been as heated as it has been since 2012, the year of his first NBA championship. Since then, LeBron James has climbed the pyramid, surpassing other legends such as Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Wilt Chamberlain.\nToday, we present to you all of LeBron James’ statistics for the Regular Season and Playoffs, indicating his position in the all-time rankings for each category.\nConsidering LeBron’s desire to play alongside his two sons, Bronny and Bryce, what other records will “The Chosen One” be able to break?\nLeBron James Stats\nStatsRegular SeasonPlayoffsGames Played7° (1.506)1° (287)Minutes Played1° (57,446)1° (11.654)Minutes per Game15° (37,17)13° (41,0)Total Points1° (40.803)1° (8.162)Points per Game6° (27,20)6° (28,5)Points in a Single Game43° (61)20° (51)Total Assists4° (11.141)2° (2.067)Assists per Game24° (7,40)16° (7,20)Assists in a Single GameND (19)77° (16)Total Rebounds28° (11.315)6° (2.348)Rebounds per Game182° (7,5)80° (9,03)Total Blocks84° (1.109)10° (252)Blocks per Game238° (0,76)114° (0,96)Total Steals10° (2.255)1° (454)Steals per Game68° (1,57)26° (1,71)Field Goals Made2° (14.670)1° (2.857)Three-Pointers Made10° (2.381)2° (456)Free Throws Made4° (8.296)1° (1.813)Triple Doubles4° (110)2° (28)Games with 20+ Points1° (1220)1° (237)\nLeBron James’ Top Plays of the Decade\nLeBron James Awards\nAwardTitleNBA champion4MVP4MVP Finals4NBA CUP1NBA In-Season Tournament MVP1All NBA13x First Team3x Second Team1x Third TeamNBA All Defensive5x First Team1x Second TeamAll Star20All Star Game MVP3Rookie of the Year1Top Scorer1More playing time3Best assistman1Olympic titles2 Gold, 1 BronzeFIBA World Cup1 BronzeFIBA AmeriCup1 Gold\n\nVisualizza questo post su InstagramUn post condiviso da Dunkest (@dunkest)\n\nLeBron James Records\nHis resume is so full of accolades and broken records that we could fill a 200-page book.

Can you guess the scoring progressions throughout their careers?\n\n\nAn elite scorer from Day 1, Kareem averaged 28.8 points as a rookie in 1969-70. He scored 14,211 points in six seasons in Milwaukee, then headed to L.A. He reached the top 10 in 1977, passed Wilt Chamberlain to become the all-time leader in 1984 and retired in 1989.\n\nEntering the NBA in 2003 out of high school, LeBron began his journey up the scoring ranks at a similar pace to Kareem. LeBron’s the youngest player to reach 10K, 20K and 30K career points and has averaged 25+ points for 19 straight seasons.\n\n\nEntering the 2022-23 season, it was not a question of if – but rather when – LeBron would break Kareem’s all-time scoring record.\n\nLeBron’s Evolution As A Scorer\n\n\nLeBron’s path to the all-time scoring title has included over 14K baskets, 2K 3-pointers, and 8K free throws. Looking at shot charts from his rookie season until now will show how his shot selection has changed over the past 20 seasons.\n\nAs a rookie, LeBron averaged 20.9 PPG. He was, as always, effective in the paint, but shot a career-low 29.0% from 3-point range.\n\nIn 2012-13 with Miami, LeBron remained dominant in the paint, but also had his most efficient season from deep — shooting 40.6% from 3-point range – providing a preview to next evolution of his scoring.\n\nIn his last two seasons with the Lakers, you can see how LeBron’s scoring has evolved, shifting more towards the perimeter. This transformation has ensured LeBron’s prolonged greatness.\n\n\nWhich teams did LeBron score the most against?\n\n\nLeBron’s tortured many fan bases across the NBA over the past 20 seasons. From his career-best 61-point game against Charlotte, to his multiple 50+ point games against Washington, New York and Milwaukee, here’s a look at which teams he’s scored the most points against.\n\nNo team has allowed more points to LeBron James than the Milwaukee Bucks. LeBron has scored 1,749 points in 61 career games vs. Milwaukee for an average of 28.7 PPG.\n\nDuring his 11 seasons in Cleveland, over two stints, LeBron scored more points against the Chicago Bulls (1,217) than any other opponent.\n\nDuring his four-year run with the Heat from 2010-2014, LeBron scored more points against the Charlotte Bobcats (Charlotte Hornets franchise) than any other opponent.\n\nSince joining the Lakers in 2018, LeBron has scored more points against the San Antonio Spurs (409) than any other opponent.\n\nHere is another look at LeBron’s scoring against all opponents\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Cavaliers\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Heat\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Lakers\n\nAssisting The King\n\n\nOf LeBron’s 14,040 field goals made, 5,220 have been assisted by a teammate entering Tuesday night. Which players have set up LeBron to score most frequently during his time in Cleveland, Miami and Los Angeles?\n\nLeBron and Dwyane Wade spent four seasons together in Miami and half a season as teammates in Cleveland. During that time, Wade assisted on 361 of LeBron’s made baskets, the most of any teammate. The partnership was reciprocal as LeBron assisted Wade 428 times.\n\nOver LeBron’s 11 seasons in Cleveland, no player set up scoring opportunities for LeBron more than Eric Snow with 292 assists.\n\nOf Dwyane Wade’s 361 assists to LeBron, 337 came during their four years as teammates in Miami. Mario Chalmers ranked second with 271 assists to LeBron with the Heat.\n\nThis is the second season that LeBron and Russell Westbrook have been teammates with Russ dishing 168 assists to LeBron, the most of any Laker during LeBron’s four-plus seasons in L.A.\n\nHere are the players that assisted LeBron grouped together by team. Click the play button or use the scroll to see his top connections season by season.\n\n\nHere is a look at the top players that assisted LeBron throughout his career. Use the dropdown to sort by season.\n\n\nLeBron’s Go-To Scoring Moves\n\n\nWhile Kareem dominated opponents with his signature Skyhook, LeBron’s scoring has come from all over the court on a variety of shot types: from thunderous dunks to fadeaway jumpers.\n\nHe even took a few hook shots of his own.\n\nJump shots have been a staple of LeBron’s scoring, accounting for at least 30% of his offense in all but one season.\n\nThis season, layups have surpassed jumpers as the biggest slice of his scoring pie, which can be seen here, and split between home and road games.\n\nA year-by-year breakdown of every shot type from LeBron by total points scored.\n\nA Three-Level Scorer\n\n\nWhen LeBron passes Kareem in scoring, he’ll do so while making nearly 1,800 fewer baskets. LeBron makes up the gap with an additional 1,300+ free throws and over 2,200 3-pointers (compared to Kareem’s 1).\n\nTrack how LeBron’s scoring on 2s, 3s and free throws has evolved over the course of his career.\n\nA season-by-season look at LeBron’s scoring splits between free throws, 2-pointers and 3-pointers based on percentage of total points. LeBron’s percentage of points on 3-pointers went from 11% in his rookie season to 28% last season in L.A.\n\nA season-by-season look at LeBron’s scoring splits, using total points scored rather than percentages. LeBron (2,478 points in 2005-06) and Kareem (2,822 points in 1971-72) both posted their highest single-season points total in their third season.\n\nLeBron’s scoring splits divided by team, looking at percentage of points scored.\n\nLeBron’s scoring splits divided by team, looking at total points scored.\n\n\nNBA Organization\n\nNBA ID\nNBA Official\nNBA Careers\nNBA Fan Code of Conduct\n\nNBA Initiatives\n\nNBA Total Health\nNBA Cares\nJr. NBA / Jr. WNBA\nNBA Foundation\nSocial Justice Coalition\n\nAcross The League\n\nNBA Communications\nLockervision\nNBA Transactions\n\nShop\n\nGlobal Stores\nNYC Store\nNBA Auctions\nNBA Photostore\n\nSubscriptions\n\nLeague Pass\nCustomer Support\n\n\n"

          "raw_content": "Contents\nLeBron James\n\n\nLeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and is frequently at the center of debates regarding the sport's all-time best, often being compared to Michael Jordan.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers, three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and sixth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 21 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history, with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA history.[7]\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[8] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[9] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[10] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship, ending the Cleveland sports curse, and winning his third Finals MVP.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers.\n\nOff the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[14][15]\n\nEarly life\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23 \n\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24  The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22]\n\nHigh school\nBasketball\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\n\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104  With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117  St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30]\n\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play several nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[16]: 143 [31] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[32]\n\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[33] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[32] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[32] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[34] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[35] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[36]\n\nFootball\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51  He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[37] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[38] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b]\n\nProfessional career\nCleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[43] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[44] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[9] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[45] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[46] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[47]\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[48] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[49] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[50] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[50] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[51]\n\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[52] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[53] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[54] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[55] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[56] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[57]\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[60] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[65] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[66] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[67]\n\nIn February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[68] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[69] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[70] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[71] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[72] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[73]\n\nAt the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79]\n\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5]\n\nIn February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[88]\n\nMiami Heat (2010–2014)\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98]\n\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[103][104][105] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[106] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[107][108] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[109][110] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[111][112] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[110][113][114]\n\nJames officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[115][116] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[117] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[118] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[119] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[120][121] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[122]\n\nThroughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[123] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[124] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[123] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[125] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[126] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[127] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5]\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[128] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[129] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[130] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[128] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[131] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[132]\n\nThe 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[133][124][134] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[123] Behind his expanded skillset,[134] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[135] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[136]\n\nIn the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[138] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[139] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[140][141] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[142] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[143] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[144] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[145] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[146] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[147]\n\nIn February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[148][149] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[150] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[151] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[152] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[153] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5]\n\nIn Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[154] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[155] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[156] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[157] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][156][158] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[159] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[160] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[161]\n\nOn March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[162] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[163] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[164] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[165] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[166] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[167] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[168] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[169]\n\nReturn to Cleveland (2014–2018)\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[170] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[171] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[172][173][174] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[175] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[176] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[177]\n\nIn January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[180] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[181] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[182] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[182] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[183] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[184] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[183]\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[185][186] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[187] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[187] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[188]\n\nTo begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[189] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[190] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[191] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[192] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[189] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[193]\n\nThe 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[194] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[195] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[196] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[197] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[198] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[199] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[200]\n\nPrior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[201] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[202] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[203] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[204] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[205] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[206] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5]\n\nIn the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[207] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[208][209] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[210] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[211] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[212]\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018–present)\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[213] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[214] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[215] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[216] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[217]\n\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[218][219] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[220] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[221] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[222] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[223] the first major injury of his career.[224] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[223] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[225] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[226] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[227] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[228]\n\n\"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'.

At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[420] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics.\n\nPlayer profile\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[421] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[422] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[134] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[423][424][425] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[426][427]\n\nOffense\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[429] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[430][431] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[432] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[134] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[433][434] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[435] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[436] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[437] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[438]\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[134] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[134][439] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[440] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[441] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[442] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[443] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][444] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[445] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[435]\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[446] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[447] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[448] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[449] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[450] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[435] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[451][452] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[453]\n\nDefense\nAt the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[454] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[455] From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season.[456] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[457] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[458] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[459][460] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[461] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[462] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[463]\n\nLegacy\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[469] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[470] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[471] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][472] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[474][475][476]\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[484] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[485] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[486] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[487][488][489] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[488][489] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[489] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[485]\n\nIn addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[490] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[491] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[492][493][494][495][496]\n\nIn 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[497] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[498]\n\nPersonal life\nJames married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[499] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[497][500] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[501] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[502] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[503] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[504] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[505] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[506]\n\nJames's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[507] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[508]\n\nIn September 2023, ESPN reported that a new set of client names from the Biogenesis scandal had been released; included was Ernest \"Randy\" Mims, a longtime friend and business manager of James, as well as David Alexander, a well-known trainer of prominent athletes who co-owned a cold-pressed juice and smoothie business with Savannah and also served as her personal trainer. The DEA determined that there \"was never any indication that LeBron James did anything wrong.\"[509][510]\n\nHealth\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, falsely believing it to be good for his heart,[511] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[512]\n\nIn January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[513] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[514]\n\nPublic image\nJames is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[515][516] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[517] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[518]\n\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[521] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[522] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[523] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[524] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[525] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[526] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[527]\n\n\n\nMemorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[530] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[531] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[532]\n\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[533] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[528][529]\n\nActivism\nPhilanthropy\nJames has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[534] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[535] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[536] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[537]\n\nIn November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[538] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[539] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[540] I Promise Village (housing complex),[541] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[542] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[15]\n\nJames is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[543][544][545] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[546]\n\nPolitics\nThroughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[547] Those include the War in Darfur,[548] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[549] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[547] the Michael Brown verdict,[550] the death of Eric Garner,[551] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[552] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[553] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[554] Kyle Rittenhouse,[555] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[556]\n\nOn August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[557] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[558]\n\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[559] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[560] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement, with some taking to social media to use racist language against him.[561][562][563] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[564] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[565][566]\n\nIn October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[567] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[568][569][570]\n\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[571] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[572] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[572] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[573]\n\nFollowing a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[574] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[575] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[576] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[577][578] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[579]\n\nOn August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[580] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[581] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years.

That is voter suppression.\"[582]\n\nOn October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[583]\n\nMedia figure and business interests\nAccording to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire,[584] making him one of the richest celebrities.\n\nJames' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict.

Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[612] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[613][614]\n\nEntertainment\nJames and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[615] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[616] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[617] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[618] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[619] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros.

The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[643]\n\nIn November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[644] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[645] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[646] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[646]\n\nJames has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[647]\n\nIn August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C.

Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[651] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[652][653]\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[116][654][655] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[656] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[657] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[658] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[659] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[660] James began re-signing[661][662] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[175] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[663] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[664]\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlay-in\nPlayoffs\nAwards and honors\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n"

          "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"

          "raw_content": "The Hoops Loop\n\nNBA History: Ranking LeBron James’ Top 5 Playoff Performances\n\nIntroduction & Criteria\n\nLeBron James, arguably the greatest player in NBA history, has played an equivalent of 3.5 full NBA seasons worth of Playoff basketball, 287 games, good enough for first place in NBA history. Throughout his illustrious career he has seen both highs and lows, whilst providing the basketball community with unforgettable performances for the ages. Therefore, I have tasked myself with the impossible mission of ranking, specifically, his top 5 playoff performances.\n\nTo rank a player’s performance in the NBA, let alone, LeBron James, is no small task. Therefore, to assist in being able to categorise and create an objective ranking, a set of criteria will be utilised to meet the aim of creating an accurate ranking.\n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n\nEach facet will be measured out of a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best and 0 the worst. The total will be ranked and measured out of a scale of 50.\n\n5. 2020 Finals Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 44/50\n\nIn a closeout game with the Lakers looking to finish off the Miami Heat and lay claim to the 2020 NBA title, LeBron James was determined as ever to get another championship on his third team. The King poured in 40 points on an unbelievable 71.4 FG%, on top of this, he managed to pull down 13 rebounds and dished out 7 assists.\n\nPlaying out of his traditional Small Forward position that he has played throughout the majority of his career, and instead at the helm of the Lakers offense as the teams point guard. The high usage, touches and ultimately responsibility further emphasis how impressive of a performance he delivered in game 5, particularly, in respect to his overall efficiency.\n\nIn the end, Game 5 came down to the wire as the infamous playoff riser, Jimmy Butler, served the Lakers an ice cold 35-point triple double. The Heats defence, a Danny Green missed shot (wide open), coupled with Jimmy’s heroics put the Lakers away in the do-or-die game for the Heat. Thus, like many of LeBron’s iconic performances, the team could not match his level of effort to pull out the win.\n\n4. 2007 ECF Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 46/50\n\nAt just 22 years old, willing a poorly constructed Cavaliers roster to heights beyond anyones expectations. This performance could be considered the genesis of the legend of LeBron, where he looked like a kid playing at the local park, a video game character, mythical, to say the least.\n\nJames’ performance against the rough and tough Detroit Pistons is defined by the staple closing period of the game, where James went unconscious by putting 25 straight points on the board to edge the Cavs over the Pistons, this would position the Cavs 3-2, in an eventual series win, proving to be the pivotal moment, not only in the game but the series.\n\nThe momentum changing game would provide the Cleveland Cavaliers with a franchise first NBA Finals appearance. A historical achievement, that in hindsight, adds further weight and significance to the feats LeBron reached during game 5.\n\nIt’s not common that young superstars display such dominance, maturity and responsibility in their game, but LeBron James was able to do just that in his showing during Game 5. A performance that has yet to be toppled by the rising stars of the NBA since.\n\n3. 2012 ECF Game 6\n\nPerformance score: 47/50\n\nAt the time of Game 6, LeBron was down a 3-2 deficit to the dynastic Boston Celtics of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This series was on the back of the disaster showing in the previous seasons final, where the Heat fell to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt was a legacy game, a turning point in LeBron’s career. If they lost, would the Heat have to rethink things over and blow it up? Is LeBron capable of leading a team to the mountain top? All these questions and much more loomed over the team like a dark cloud.\n\n\n\nUnrelenting, and defiant in preserving the Miami Heat, who were on a lifeline at this point in the series. LeBron, as seen in the thumbnail image above, had a look in his eye, only comparable to a lion stalking its prey. He attacked the Boston Celtics with brute force, finesse fadeaways from the mid-post and athletic finishes around the rim.\n\nHe silenced the Celtics superteam and the raging home crowd with 45-points on 73.1% shooting, along with 15 rebounds and 5 assists. A performance that turned down the volume on the critics within the media and NBA fanbase, and proved that nothing was going to deter LeBron from getting his first ring.\n\nThis infamous game lives on as one of the most iconic games of his career, and arguably one of the greatest performances of all time.\n\n2. 2016 Finals Game 7\n\nPerformance score: 49.5/50\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the greatest NBA game of all time, the historic series comeback by the Cavaliers, scratching and clawing their way back into the series after being knocked down 3-1, against the greatest regular season team of all time.\n\nThe unquantifiable pressure emanating from Oracle Arena on June 19, 2016 could be felt through television screens halfway around the world. The stakes couldn’t get any higher, it was up to the stars to prove to the world whether they could step into the limelight. An underlying narrative was that LeBron had promised to raise a banner for the city of Cleveland, in his return from his Miami Heat stint. More pressure than ever was on Jame to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he did. The King produced an all around masterclass, a 27 point triple-double. Additionally, an amazing stat to put into perspective just how important James was during the crucial game is that he contributed to 50% of the Cavaliers points directly, either by assist or scoring (27 points, 19 points created from assists). The unreal offensive control was complemented by stellar defense, which birthed the iconic and arguably greatest highlight of LeBron’s career “The Block”.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to not place this as the greatest game of his career due to the unreal performance on both sides of the floor, the stakes and ultimately, the outcome of the iconic game.\n\n1. 2018 Finals Game 1\n\nPerformance score: 50/50\n\nIn a series that perfectly emulates the biblical story of David versus Goliath, LeBron James established a new precedent with his Game 1 performance. Before the series began, many within the media and broader NBA community assumed that the Golden State Warriors would trample over the one man army Cavaliers in dominant and blown-out fashion.

He was the one who was supposed to take over from Michael Jordan and hence was given the nickname \"King James\". From being the cover athlete of Sports Illustrated while still in high school to becoming a 4 time NBA Champion and then going on to lead with his voice on topics of social justice. Amongst many achievements and accolades James has earned on the NBA court, his greatest moment came quite possibly in March 2024 when he became the one and only player to date to ever eclipse the 40,000 mark in career points. He is the greatest success story in the league's history.\n \nMichael Jordan was the pioneer who led the NBA to the global stage back in the 90s. The heights of global fame and stardom that he achieved put him in such rare air that he is still to this day considered the greatest athlete of all time. He relentlessly pursued greatness and won 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls. After retiring he went on to become a business tycoon amassing a huge amount of wealth. A few years later he bought the Charlotte Hornets and became the first-ever American athlete to do so.\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Stats\nMichael Jordan was all about taking over the game and single-handedly outplaying his opponents with his dominant game. LeBron is a more balanced player who scores when challenged to score but his game is more about getting his teammates involved, grabbing rebounds, and doing those little things that help a team get a victory.\nCareer (Averages)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPoints27.130.1Rebounds7.56.2Assists7.45.3Steals1.52.3Blocks0.70.8Turnovers3.52.7Minutes37.938.3Field goal %50.649.73-point %34.832.7Free throw %73.683.5\nCareer (Totals)LeBron JamesMichael JordanGames1,4951,072Points40,54334,241Rebounds11,2086,672Assists11,0315,633Steals2,2752,514Blocks1,114893Turnovers5,2202,924Minutes56,70041,011\n(LeBron stats as of October 2024)\n\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Advanced Stats\nWhen one is comparing two different eras, it’s not ideal to just look at the major stats. Sometimes, advanced stats give us an insight into the playing style and a real nitty-gritty way of evaluating two different aspects of the same attribute.\nAdvanced Career StatsLeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)27.227.9Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)146.5116.1Box Plus/Minus (BPM)8.769.2Win Shares (WS)255.14214.0True Shooting % (TS%)58.8%56.9%Usage Rate (USG%)31.6%33.3%\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Playoff Stats\nNBA Playoffs are where LeBron James' talents are unleashed.

Overall, both players rank high not only in the regular season but in the postseason as well, and once again deciding the better player between the two in the postseason is still as tough as ever. In the following table, we pit LeBron James with Michael Jordan and take a look at the advanced stats of the two in the playoffs.\nAdvanced Career Stats (Playoffs)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)28.228.6Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)33.924.7Box Plus/Minus (BPM)10.211.1Win Shares (WS)55.739.8True Shooting % (TS%)58.356.8Usage Rate (USG%)3235.6\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan NBA Finals Stats\nLeBron James has been to the finals 10 times, winning the championship on four occasions.

While Jordan does lead in most of the important categories here, James is not too far behind and can still catch up before his career is over. Therefore deciding whether MJ or LeBron is better falls short in this category as well.\nAchievementsLeBron JamesMichael JordanNBA Finals appearances106Championships46Regular season MVP45Defensive Player of the Year01Finals MVP46Rookie of the Year11Scoring titles110Assist leader10Steals leader03All-Star selections2014All NBA selections2011All-Defensive selections69\nMichael Jordan vs LeBron James Net Worth\nLeBron James over his career and through other business ventures has amassed a fortune of over $1.2 billion. Basketball is the driving force behind LeBron’s wealth; when you’ve been a top player for almost 20 years, the game checks simply add up. According to Spotrac’s financial data, James has earned an impressive total of over $430 million in salary during his time in the NBA.\nKing James’ income isn’t limited to basketball, though. Other than his massive Nike contract and game checks, the Lakers star is also quite the entrepreneur. Thanks to investments in Blaze Pizza, Beats, and Liverpool FC, among other brands.\nWhile LeBron James’ net worth is nothing to look down on, he’s still nowhere near His Airness. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan’s net worth has now reached a staggering $3 billion.\nMichael Jordan didn’t make that much in the NBA. He only commanded truly massive salaries during his last two seasons in Chicago. Jordan earned $94 million in-game checks, with roughly $63 million coming in just 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nHowever, his superstar status paid dividends. Apart from his massive contract with Nike, he endorsed everything from underwear to Gatorade and also McDonald's; those deals kept the cash flowing. In retirement, he also managed to get into an elite group by becoming an owner of an NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets.\nAlso Read: LeBron James Net Worth\nHas LeBron James ever played against Michael Jordan?\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan never got the chance to play each other on the NBA court. Unfortunately for both superstars, their careers could not overlap as Jordan had made his way out of the league just a few months before LeBron stepped foot on the NBA court.\nWhile Jordan's last game in the NBA came on April 16, 2003, LeBron's first career NBA game was on Oct. 29, 2003. For die-hard fans of the NBA, a matchup between these two legends would have been something surreal, however, it may not have accounted for much as Jordan was already past his prime having turned 40 years old while LeBron on the other hand was just a rookie in 2003.\nWho is the GOAT of the NBA?\nMichael Jordan is often considered the GOAT of the NBA. At present, Jordan is the forerunner in all accolades other than All-Star appearances, All-NBA Team, and the Hall of Fame. He has a better NBA Finals record. Furthermore, he has two rings more than LeBron James. He also has three more All-Defense selections and an additional MVP award. He also holds a Defensive Player of the Year award, an accomplishment that has eluded James. LeBron's commitment to amassing his fourth ring has brought him closer to his goal - winning six or more rings.\nHowever, Jordan was not the complete player that James was. LeBron James is the only player in NBA history with 10K points, rebounds, and assists. He is in the top 10-15 of virtually every list in the league and has also become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. James also leads the league in almost every playoff statistic, having been to the NBA Finals 10 times. He is also a much better playmaker than Jordan ever was, leading the league in assists once. He has all the stats and longevity arguments in his favor over Jordan, who was mainly valued as a scorer on the offensive end. While most people would say Michael Jordan is the Greatest player of all time. Few people like Detroit Pistons rookie Cade Cunningham believe LeBron James is the greatest player.\nWho is a better player between LeBron and Jordan?\n\nImage source: CBS Sports\nLeBron James' statistics stipulate that he is the better overall basketball player. LeBron is a more efficient player, a much better passer, and a rebounder than Jordan was. Jordan, on the flip side, has a much better free throw percentage, which sustains the points-per-game statistic. The two are relatively equivalent in efficiency ratings, with Jordan being first overall in NBA history and LeBron trailing close behind at second.\nMichael averaged more steals per game, but both players are exactly even in blocks per game. Having played so many fewer games than James, Jordan's defensive capabilities do outshine the current Lakers forward. With more All-Defensive Team selections as well as an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, the edge on that side of the ball favors the former Bulls guard. LeBron has also turned the ball over more per game as well.\nThe one thing James has in his favor are all the longevity stats and these stats will continue to stack up until he calls it a day in the NBA. Till then the gap between both players will continue to increase but then again, Jordan has already achieved so much in less time. Having said that, one of the most important records that James now possesses is leading the entire NBA in the most points ever scored.\nAfter going through everything the game has to offer, the choice between the GOAT of the NBA does come down to personal taste. Both are legends of the game who have given it their all on the court, and their statistics and records are also comparable. It is difficult to pick out any one player as the GOAT since the eras are different, the rules are different, and players play in different positions, so comparing a guard with a forward is not an ideal way of arguing who is better.\nAlso read: All about Michael Jordan’s net worth\nRead Less  \nFAQs on Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James\nQ.

            "raw_content": "Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan has won 6 rings!\n\nMichael Jordan has won championships with:\n\n1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\n\nMichael Jordan won championship rings in half of his 13 seasons with the Chicago Bulls. He won six championships with the Bulls and led the team to two titles with three goals each. Jordan won his first championship in 1991 against Magic Johnson and the Lakers. That was followed by two consecutive titles in 1992 against the Blazers and 1993 against the Suns.\n\nChampionship rings have been part of the culture since the first NBA Finals in 1947. It’s amazing that Michael Jordan has won six such rings. The value of a championship ring remains priceless to those who receive it, as it is a souvenir of those who have worked hard to win the championship.\n\nYou can’t compare a ring won by an NBA legend like Michael Jordan to an average NBA player. Championship rings won by classic NBA teams, like the ones mentioned above, are expensive. If you buy or inherit an NBA championship ring from a legendary team like the Chicago Bulls of 1996, Boston Celtics of 1986, Lakers of 2001, or Lakers of 1987, you have a mini-bench in your closet. For example, the Herald Sun reported that a 1996 NBA championship ring from a member of the Bulls was for sale on eBay for $29,923. It is better if the team in question has performed excellently in the year in which they have won the championship.\n\nAs the league’s leading scorer and MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year never had enough of his lightness like Michael Jordan. He played the regular season to tell other players that he was better than them and that if they were in the upcoming playoffs, he would catch up with them. His only goal at any point was to focus on winning a ring at the end of the season.\n\nWinning the championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994-95 was a big deal. A ring can cost between $20,000 and $300,000. It really depends on who wears the ring. Hakeem Olajuwon had a championship ring, which was certainly a great start.\n\nI compared the constant value and relative value of the four players in the postseason to show that Michael Jordan is separating himself from the others, and the three that separate him from the six rings that matter.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA gold medal, the others being Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson. Russell’s 11 championships are the most of any player in NBA history.\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. He did the job at both ends of the floor, leading the Chicago Bulls to eight rings in six seasons, two of which were three-goal throws. Jordan dominated the NBA from the start, finishing with a perfect 6-0 record in the Finals, which is unlikely to happen again given the nature and dynamics of the league.\n\nBill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Shaquille O’Neal. Kareem, Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and Horace Grant had a season in which he scored 16.2 points per game in the postseason.\n\nA look at the Robin factor from year to year shows that Jordan has not benefited in any form or form from distorted seasons. His six rings make up six of the highest seven scores. He’s the only player you can’t argue with in the team.\n\nOnly four players in NBA history who haven’t played for Boston have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships during his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs. Seven of Russell’s teammates in Boston had seven or more championships. Including Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7).\n\nNo more than a handful of senior members of staff carry this rare distinction, in addition, of course, to the triumvirate of six-time champions Jordan, Pippen and Phil Jackson. Capp’s legacy is defined by his membership of the Bulls’ elite club, which has won six NBA championship titles and a complete set of club championship rings.\n\nIn fact, Jordan had six finals MVPs to the other two or two plays. As for Russell, in his first two championship teams and in his last, it was obvious he wasn’t even the second best player on the team. He was the youngest player on a team full of Hall of Famers and a veteran in his prime.\n\nThe steal and the shot, if you will, but my favorite moment of the game was the call from NBC’s Bob Costas. It’s one of the most iconic calls of all time. It was part of what made the legend of Michael Jordan so powerful. When the Bulls didn’t have the ball, you knew MJ was going to find a way to change that.\n\nDespite the fact that his doubters claimed he was just a regular-season player and would never be able to lead the Bulls into the ring, no one heard one. He was able to enjoy the taste of fame and he never looked back.\n\nAt 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls (13, 1984-93, 1995-98), the Washington Wizards and a few others in 2001-03. Jordan’s greatest years came with the Bulls in the 1990s, when he led them to six championships and as many finals appearances in eight years. He recorded a remarkable number for a player who was nearly 40 years old (35 when he was in the twilight of his career with the Wizards).\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in all 82 games. In the postseason, he averaged 30.7 points, 49 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals as the Bulls lost just one game en route to the finals. In the final, the Bulls jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and the SuperSonics. But the Sonics retaliated with two straight wins, and Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\nThe tip of the ring has a characteristic emblematic shape, embellished with the Bulls logo, a red stone with golden trims and horns in the middle and synthetic diamond and stone rivets on the face. The ring is engraved with 10K on the inside of Jostens Manufacturers.\n\nPlayers Name | Michael Jordan\nHow Many Rings | 6\nDrafted By | Chicago Bulls\nWon Rings With | 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\nPlayers College | North Carolina\nPlayers Birthday | February 17, 1963\nHometown | Brooklyn, New York\nYear Drafted | 1984\nRound Drafted | 1\nPick Drafted | 3\nRELATED RINGS\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n"

The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007.

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

However, by the 2022-23 season, we see a more even distribution of three-point attempts across positions, with centers and power forwards contributing more from beyond the arc. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shift suggests that the NBA is moving toward a model where \"shooting bigs\" are becoming more common, while point guards are not necessarily relied upon as primary three-point shooters.\n\n3-Pointers by Team\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nStatistical Increases: The Modern NBA’s Offensive Explosion\n\nAcross all three seasons, there has been a noticeable increase in points, assists, and rebounds, with three-pointers seeing the most significant rise. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis trend underscores the growing emphasis on the three-point shot as a primary offensive weapon. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in these statistics is a testament to the evolution of the game, where teams are not only scoring more but also relying heavily on the three-point line to do so.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nComparing Generational Talents: Jordan, Curry, Jokic, and Green\n\nThe Future of the NBA: What’s Next?\n\n"

This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.\n\nArticle Details\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\nReferences\n\nAlsasua, R., Lapresa, D., Arana, J., Anguera, M.T., & Garzón, B.

ABSTRACT This article aimed to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan by studying his technical actions, shots, and relationship with teammates. The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.

INTRODUCTION Basketball is one of the most practiced sports in the world (Quispe, 2023) and research has traditionally focused on aspects such as training, biomechanics, health and injuries, and physiology (Amirnordin et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Shi & Wu, 2024). However, technical-tactical studies, carried out from systematic observation, have not been sufficiently developed (Remmert, 2003) to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of increasingly sophisticated data analysis software, combined with the development of rigorous methodological approaches, provided researchers the tools to prove or disprove numerous theories about basketball that, until then, lacked scientific credibility. A particularly prominent area of the current research in the field of basketball is the relationship between physiological demands and the technical-tactical performance that players develop (Figueira et al, 2022). The depth and sophistication of these interactions, directly related to creativity and intra-team coordination (Furley & Memmert, 2015), confirm that basketball, along with its underlying structures, is a complex system (Klostermann et al., 2018). This complexity of the game generates complex data when studied, which, if simplified and decomposed into measurable units, becomes easier to analyse (Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In the case of basketball, this \"simplification\" is the only way to validate associations and/or causal relationships that occur during the game and obtain behavioural structures and interactions between them, from a certain distance, that does not affect their development. In this complex game, the whole, which means the team, is more than the sum of its parts, hence the importance of understanding how different players interact and relate to each other. One of the main data analysis techniques to analyse complex interactions in sports is polar coordinate analysis applied to data collected through systematic observation (Anguera & Hernández-Mendo, 2015; Castañer et al., 2016, 2017). Polar coordinate analysis can be used to measure the spontaneous behaviour of players interacting in their natural environment from the perspective of a specific behaviour, known as focal behaviour, having been performed with a high degree of success in other team sports such as soccer (Maneiro & Amatria, 2018) or handball (Navarro et al, 2018). In this sense, this typology of analysis has proven to be an effective tool to decompose the complexity of the game (Lago & Anguera, 2002; Castellano & Hernández-Mendo, 2003; Perea et al., 2012; Robles et al., 2013). Its application to the study of several of the best athletes in the world from various collective sports disciplines (Castañer et al., 2016; Castañer et al., 2017; Maneiro and Amatria, 2018) has allowed researchers to obtain practical conclusions about what makes these players excellent and, in return, make recommendations to improve the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. However, polar coordinate analysis has not yet been tested in players with a specific demarcation such as shooting guards. Most of the research on shooting guards is based on different groups of players based on their position in the field between this specific demarcation and point guards, obtaining interconnected results, which in no case can be confirmed as definitive for this type of demarcation, that is, the data analysed is generally outside the specific context of the actions and tactical technical performance developed by these players (Gómez et al, 2007; Sampaio et al., 2008). On the other hand, the relationships that occur between players are usually viewed through a prism focused on their traditional role according to their position on the field. However, in today's basketball, where greater versatility is increasingly required from players, only three key positions (guard, forward and centre) are identified, according to Sampaio et al. (2006), leaving the shooting guard position diluted and integrated in a non-specific way as such. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 109 This happens since the traditional mission of the shooting guard is characterized by their permeability, being a driving force that helps the point guards to organize the game and raise the ball, as well as having mastered shots at all distances (outside, inside and free throws), an aspect that conditions him to be the team's highest scorer and the player with the greatest responsibility attacking. This is why his identification as such is not defined, since he shares the functions of point guard and small forward. In this sense, Fransen et al. (2016), in their study on leadership in sport, determine that the players with main rolls in the game are in a very beneficial spatial position that, in combination with their high tactical responsibilities, positions them as team leaders. Following this line, there are many current examples of great international players that play this position such as Stephen Curry, Luca Doncic or James Hardem, who have as role models players like Kobe Bryant, who had at the same time Michael Jordan as an idol to emulate, latter considered the best shooting guard of all time (Greer, 2023). Given the above, it is considered appropriate to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the best shooting guards of all time in his natural environment. This will be carried out through the study of his interactions between teammates and his executed technique, aiming to unequivocally and scientifically establish the elements that must be present in players who play or wish to play in this position that is so relevant in basketball. Applying a robust methodological approach, combined with in-depth multidimensional analysis of rigorously coded data, will help provide objective insights into how Michael Jordan interacts with his environment and makes him unique. The specific objective is to analyse Michael Jordan's technical skills in the NBA playoff final of the 1995-1996 season through his technical actions, his shoots and his relationship with his teammates. METHOD To carry out the development of the present research, the Observational Methodology (Anguera, 1979) has been applied. The research design, in accordance with Sánchez-Algarra and Anguera (2013), follows an Idiographic model –given that a single team is the unit of study–, a Tracking model –studying during the games that constitute the finals of the 1995-1996 playoffs–, and a Multidimensional model –due to the categories that form the dimensions constituting the observation instrument. The conducted observation has been guided by scientific criteria with total perceptiveness and as a non-participating observer. Participants/Sample The observational sampling conducted has been intentional (Anguera, et al., 2011) with the American professional basketball team Chicago Bulls during the development of the playoff finals for the NBA Champion title in the 1995-1996 season (in this season, the Chicago Bulls won 72 games, breaking the all-time record for most victories in a season, a record that lasted for 20 years). The videos used are publicly available television broadcasts that have been retrieved for the study. All offensive sequences developed by the team during the 6 games that make up the finals of that season –1995-1996– have been coded. The 521 coded offensive sequences consist of 4798 multi-events. Intersessional consistency has been ensured through the following elements: the same ball size, the same court dimensions, the same game time, the same players on the roster, and the same jersey assignments. Observation instrument The present research required the development of an ad hoc observation instrument –see Table 1– which drew from the following sources: the works of Alsasua et al. (2018) and Arroyo et al. (2022). The instrument adapted their contributions and included new dimensions –Player Position, Defensive System, and Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 110 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. Consequence– which will provide a solid foundation for addressing the research objective. The instrument is a combination of nested category systems in field formats –dimensions. These categories adhere to the premise of being exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Table 1.

Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 111 Recording and coding The data was recorded (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2014) using Lince software, version 1.2.1 (Gabin et al., 2012), achieving an intra-observer agreement value of .91. The obtained data is of type IV, i.e., concurrent and time-based (Anguera et al., 2011). Subsequently, two additional programs were employed. The first one was Gseq v5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011), through which sequential analysis of delays was conducted. Later, the program Hoisan, version 1.2 (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2012), was utilized. The data obtained from the previous software was entered and analysed for obtaining polar coordinates. Finally, for the representation of results, the ObserTools application (Rodríguez-Medina et al., 2021) was employed. Data quality The data collection was carried out by two graduates in Sports Science with extensive experience in the studied sport and the use of observational methodology. However, the observers received specific training for data collection in this study following the phases recommended by Anguera (2003). The primary observer recorded all sequences comprising the observational sampling, while the second observer recorded 16.7% of the total sample. The reliability of the obtained data was calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between nominal classifications where there is no order of ranking. GSEQ software version 5.1 was used for the calculation of this coefficient following the recommendations established by Bakeman & Quera (2011). The concordance index achieved by the primary observer was .91 (intra-observer agreement). Regarding the result of inter-observer agreement, it was higher than .86 in all games included in the study (game 1 = .93; game 2 = .87; game 3 = .94; game 5 = .88, game 6 = .87). Considering these concordance data, it can be stated that the agreement is almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977). Data analysis Two types of data analysis have been employed to address the stated objectives: synchronous analysis and diachronic analysis. Synchronous analysis through inferential statistics has been used to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria, using the Pearson chi-square statistic (χ²). This was done by applying the following formula: χ2 = ∑ [(𝐹 𝑖𝑗−𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗)2 𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑘 𝑖,𝑗=1 The computation of this statistic was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0. Regarding the diachronic analysis, polar coordinates analysis has been employed, which is a very recent typology of analysis in sports science (Anguera and Hernández-Mendo, 2015). Cochran's Zsum (1954) is the foundation and origin of this analysis technique, which applies and is based on the principle that the sum of N independent z scores is normally distributed, with Z = 0 and s = N. Thus, the statistic 𝑍sum = ∑ 𝑧 √𝑛 𝑚 𝑙 (where n is the number of delays), according to Sackett (1980), allows measuring the strength or associative consistency between different behaviours. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 112 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. The polar coordinates technique, developed by Sackett (1980) and later refined by Anguera (1997), is utilized to identify the relationships between behaviours. The technique involves one of these behaviours: the conditioning behaviour or focal behaviour and the remaining behaviours, which constitute the various dimensions of the observation instrument (conditioned behaviours). This analysis is performed both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (-1 to -5), resulting in a vector for each behaviour related to the focal behaviour, with a specific angle and radius. Based on the angle obtained by the vector, it can occupy one of the four quadrants or sectors that make up the polar coordinate. Depending on the quadrant the vector occupies, the activation or inhibition relationship between behaviours varies. In quadrant I, the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. In quadrant II, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the retrospective plane, while it is not in the prospective plane. In quadrant III, the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour in both the prospective and retrospective planes. Lastly, in quadrant IV, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the prospective plane, while it is not in the retrospective plane. RESULTS During Jordan's participation in the 6 games that make up the sample, he interacts with the ball a total of 536 times out of the team's total of 2996 interventions, accounting for 17.89% of the actions in the offensive play where the ball goes through his hands. Regarding the technical actions executed by Michael Jordan, the obtained results indicate the presence of significant differences (χ² = 163006; p < .001). Standout actions include dribbling –Drib– with 35.9%, Free-throw shooting –Lan– (11.9%), and Dribble –Bot– (12.6%), percentages superior in all cases to the results achieved by his teammates. On the other hand, RP –reception and pass– and Pas –pass– actions present lower percentage results compared to the rest of the teammates with 34.0% and 2.7%, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

Notably, the actions of TEs –Static Shot– (31.9%) and TAtR –Backward Jump Shot– with 15.9% stand out in this regard. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 113 Effectiveness Regarding shooting effectiveness, i.e., the success of making or missing the shooting action, the results obtained, when comparing the performances of Michael Jordan with the rest of his teammates, show significant differences (χ² = 1615, p < .001) in favour of Michael Jordan, presenting much higher shooting efficiency percentages than the rest of his teammates –Table 4. Table 4. Shooting effectiveness. Ineffective Effective Other players 54.1% 45.9% Michael Jordan 48.8% 51.2% There are no significant differences in Jordan's involvement and the moment of the game, nor between the moment and the effectiveness of the shot, nor between the moment and the effectiveness between games. Finally, the results obtained are presented regarding the associative analysis through the use of polar coordinates technique, where Michael Jordan is related to the rest of the players in the squad who participated in the different games played. For the development of this analysis, the focal behaviour J23 has been related to the rest of the categories that make up the dimension (J33, J91, J13, J07, J09, J25, J34, J08, J22, J30, J00, J53, and J35), as well as with itself (J23). This analysis aims to verify the relationship established between Michael Jordan and the rest of the teammates throughout the final phase. The results obtained (Table 5 and Figure 1) show the criterion category J23 (Michael Jordan) with a radius of 7.24 and an angle of 45 degrees in quadrant I, where the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. Also, the categories J25 (Steve Kerr), J22 (John Salley), J00 (Randy Brown), J34 (Bill Wennington), and J30 (Jud Buechler) are observed with radii of 5.96, 3.69, 3.02, 3.33, and 2.96, and angles of 223.63°, 230.61°, 259.26°, 226.63°, and 238.32° respectively, in quadrant III, where the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. Figure 1. Representation of the behavioural map establishing category J23 as the focal behaviour in relation to his teammates in the 1996 finals matches. DISCUSSION Following Anguera and Hernández-Mendo (2015), the effectiveness of observational methodology lies in its ability to conduct a diachronic analysis with type II and type IV data, meaning data that include an order and a time component. However, conventional synchronic statistical analyses are also relevant, seeking associations between dimensions that provide categorical data to meet the objectives established in match analysis (O’Donoghue, 2009). Regarding the technical actions performed by Michael Jordan, dribbling stands out as the most prominent. This technical action is characteristic of shooting guards, who, unlike point guards, not only have offensive construction responsibilities, but also play a role in breaking the repetitive dynamics of the attack and are players with a high degree of technical proficiency (Okazaki et al., 2004; De Rose et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007). Regarding his shooting performance, Jordan demonstrates a particular expertise in free throw shooting, with a very high success rate. In this regard, this proficiency, coupled with his publicly acknowledged dedication to practicing this technique after daily training sessions, is closely linked to dribbling, as through these one-on-one situations, he manages to draw personal fouls in his favour, and these situations end up leading to free throw attempts, proving to be a decisive performance factor in basketball (Csataljay et al., 2009; Paulauskas et al., 2018). On the other hand, concerning the type of shot Jordan executes most notable, it is the fadeaway. This shooting style became his signature move, not only due to its repetition as the team's offensive finish but also because of his accuracy in scoring. This shooting technique serves as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned dribbling technique. Jordan uses dribbling as a deceptive move or feint to create optimal space, combined with the slight distance gained from the defender when jumping backward, allowing for a higher likelihood of successful execution (Courel-Ibañez et al., 2017). Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 115 In this regard, considering Jordan's shooting efficiency during the finals, especially if we take into account the volume and relevance of his shots, it can be observed the significance of this player in the team's scoring success. The precision in field goals is a crucial factor in achieving success in a game, as these variables represent both individual and collective offensive effectiveness (García et al., 2013; Malarranha et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, professional basketball has undergone significant development and evolution in the game over the last decade, showcasing players with increasingly versatile profiles (Courel-Ibáñez et al., 2017; Mateus et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to update knowledge about performance profiles in young players with professional potential and assess their suitability for today's high-level basketball (Ibáñez et al., 2018). However, it is crucial not to overlook the qualities and capabilities of players who have left their mark on the history of international basketball, particularly in the NBA, where players often exhibit a higher degree of specialization in their game compared to other competitions (Paulauskas et al., 2018). CONCLUSIONS The objective set in this research was to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan in the NBA 1995-1996 playoff finals through his technical actions, shooting, and his relationship with his teammates. To address this objective, two types of analyses, synchronous and diachronic, have been employed, through which, based on the results obtained, the following conclusions can be reached: - Regarding his actions, dribbling stands out, as well as the execution of free throws, which are strongly related elements. Here, Jordan demonstrates excellent ball control and 1x1 skills, forcing defences to engage with more than one opponent and causing defensive personal fouls. - The type of shot he performs that stands out is the fadeaway, a shooting action strongly linked to 1x1 situations. This provides a wide variety of resources and solutions to different 1x1 and even 1x2 scenarios for this player, making defending him a very complex situation due to the unpredictability of his actions. - Jordan is a completely consistent player with effectiveness indices in his actions and a level of participation that remains constant during all four quarters of each game and throughout the six games that make up the NBA finals. - The relationship between Jordan and his teammates does not show significant results exclusively with himself. This is interpreted as a player with great adaptability who both includes his teammates and is included by them in the plays, and the results clearly identify the team as rotation or non-participative. These types of studies allow us to advance and better understand the game of one of the best basketball players in the world. This enables the replication of his actions and a deeper comprehension and appreciation of the evolution of this sport. Similarly, this study serves as guidance for coaches and players in developmental categories, where the specificity of the position is less emphasized, and a more versatile player profile is increasingly valued, capable of effectively participating in the entire development of offensive actions.

Consider one such debate: who is the NBA’s greatest of all time (henceforth referred to as the GOAT)? While social isolation has stripped NBA fans of a thrilling regular season finish and leaves large what-ifs surrounding what would certainly have been the most compelling postseason in the better part of 10 years, it has amply fanned the flames of the old GOAT argument. With no new basketball to consume, I, like many fans, have allowed myself to be consumed by discussing the GOAT across various social media platforms, on FaceTime calls with siblings, or even in appropriately socially distanced activities.\n\nMany of these discussions have come about as a consequence of the riveting docu-series “The Last Dance” (focusing on the Chicago Bulls of the 1980s and ‘90s). Surely no NBA fan can watch the drama of these Bulls teams without being drawn into the GOAT conversation by their singular star, Michael Jeffrey Jordan. No discussion of the GOAT can be taken seriously without the consideration of Michael Jordan, the legendary shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls. Frankly, the GOAT debate begins and ends here for a large portion of NBA fans, and for good reason. Michael Jordan’s individual and team accomplishments literally fill books, and those accolades do not account for his cultural impact on basketball in the US and across the globe. Furthermore, his appeal and impact on a global level fail to do justice to the intensity of his individual preparation and competitive drive which inspired and elevated a generation of NBA All-Stars that followed in his footsteps.\n\nDespite all this, GOAT cases are made (legitimately) for players that came before and after Michael Jordan. Indeed, if the question was easily settled, there would be no debate. And yet, the debate rages on, with varying levels of rhetorical and analytical rigor but with all the fevered passion of a contest that has come down to the wire. The purpose of this report is to approach the GOAT conversation in a data-reinforced manner. I look beyond traditional box score metrics to quantify Michael Jordan’s case for the GOAT, though my own analytical biases will inevitably arise.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make the case for Michael Jordan as the NBA’s GOAT, beginning with a suitable data set is critical. In the case of MJ, I did not find it sensible to compare him to every NBA player that has ever played because (no disrespect) he would simply outshine most of them to an enormous extent. Moreover, the field of potential GOAT candidates has been whittled down over time to a relative handful of players (48 in the case of my data set) by people who form the NBA’s All-Decade teams. These teams are comprised of the greatest players in the 1980, ’90s, and so on until present. I considered only the All-Decade teams from the 1980s until the 2010s because 1) data and advanced statistics for previous players were inconsistently available, 2) the introduction of the 3-point line in 1979 skews scoring statistics from before this time period, and 3) Michael Jordan either played against or inspired the players on this list (often both).\n\nIn terms of the data set’s composition, I chose to shy away from traditional box score or “counting” statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) in favor of more “advanced” metrics. One of the issues with sports data is high levels of correlation between variables. For example, a player who scores a lot of points may also rebound a lot and have a high number of assists, all because they happen to be on the court for a large portion of the game. Having high correlation between your variables is like listening to a song with two guitarists: you may like the sound overall, but it is hard to tell which of the two guitarist is making “more” of the sound you like. Similarly, if we are trying to measure the impact of one variable or another, if they are highly correlated, we may not be able to tell which variable is the most impactful, which can lead to unreliable results when attempting to analyze the data.\n\nPart of the solution to this problem is to use advanced metrics, which are designed to combine and adjust more traditional measures to create measures that take some of the correlation problems out of a data set and also give more insight into a player’s impact on the game. Some of the advanced metrics included in this data set are described below (mostly paraphrased from basketball-reference.com’s excellent glossary):\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating — a combination of various counting statistics that essentially counts a player’s positive and negative statistical contributions, adjusts them for the pace of the game, and compares each individual to the league average in order to determine efficiency.\n\nUsage Rate — an estimate of the percentage of team’s plays that an individual player used.\n\nBox Plus/Minus — an estimate of how many points a player contributed above a league-average player on a league average team. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nWin Shares — an estimate that assigns a “share” of each team win to each player based on that player’s contribution to the win. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage — a measure of shooting efficiency based on shot type.\n\nFree Throw and Three Point Rates — these rates are measures of offensive efficiency, measuring and-1 free throws and the proportion of field goal attempts from three-point range.\n\nInitial Visualizations and Observations\n\nTo begin analyzing the data, I decided to take a look at plots that detail some of the attributes that make a player truly great. The first of these is a scatter plot comparing usage and efficiency, color coded by decade and sized by win shares. Why might usage and efficiency be an interesting comparison? Well, because there is generally a trade off between the two. Typically, a player that is used more is less efficient (think more turnovers, more missed shots, etc.). Conversely, a highly efficient player may appear more efficient because they are not used at a high rate. With that trade off scenario in mind, take a look at the following plot, comparing the usage and efficiency of the All-Decade teams:\n\nA few things stand out. First, with these GOAT candidates, there is hardly any evidence of a trade off between usage and efficiency. If anything, there is a positive correlation, meaning higher usage is related to higher efficiency. I take this as evidence of the greatness of all these players. Second, there is a noticeable difference in the distribution of players in some decades: those in the 1980s tended to be more in the lower left corner up through the center of the plot, while players in the 2010s seem to drift from center up toward the upper right corner. While there are several interpretations for this, I tend to think the emphasis on making the game “more” efficient in recent years can explain this trend. Despite that trend, however, the final point is the most striking to me: Michael Jordan is the most highly used and the most efficient of all the players in the data set and he has among the highest win shares to boot. If you were looking for one player that you could use again and again and again and still get efficient results at a historical level, look no further than MJ.\n\nThe next two charts are somewhat similar in that they look at a player’s impact on the defensive and offensive aspects of the game. I took win shares per 48 minutes and box plus/minus, broke them down into their offensive and defensive components, and plotted the players to show what end of the floor each player impacted the most.\n\nHere, the results match intuition to a large degree. Perennial defensive stalwarts like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are firmly in the high defense, low offense corner of the graphs, whereas prolific offensive players like Adrian Dantley and Steve Nash drift out more toward the high offense and low defense corner. Who occupies the coveted high offense, high defense corner, you ask? Who else? While David Robinson and LeBron James both edge into the realm, Jordan represents the pinnacle of a player who impacts the game at an elite level on both ends of the floor. Combine this with his best-in-class efficiency and usage rates, and his case for the GOAT solidifies.\n\nFactor Analysis — Drawing the GOAT with math\n\nDespite the evidence presented above, it is important to remember that those comparisons of usage versus efficiency and offensive versus defensive prowess are ones that I came up with, and therefore, they reflect my biases about what the GOAT should look like. Instead, factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) allows us the opportunity to mathematically determine a few “factors” (combinations of variables) that best describe the data set. In other words, factor analysis can be a way to check if our intuition about what factors are important in determining who the GOAT is. Running a factor analysis on this data set, we have the following three factors:\n\nThere are a few important things to break down here. First, the way to read the three factor columns is to look for the largest numbers in each column and see which variables they correspond with. Doing this, we might say that factor 1 emphasizes the importance of offensive efficiency, while factor 2 emphasizes defense, and factor 3 emphasizes usage. This reading of the factors somewhat reinforces my intuition of what attributes are important in determining the GOAT.\n\nSecond, the little red box at the bottom of the table indicates how much of the variation in the data set can be explained by the three factors above, about 65%. That means there is still about 35% of the differences between these players that cannot be explained by the data included in these factors. That is not surprising, and it is certainly a good reminder that these comparisons I shared should be taken with a grain of salt. However, there is at least some evidence that looking for an elite two-way player with high usage and high efficiency will get you on a suitable path for determining the GOAT.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these numbers and charts will do nothing to settle the debate over the GOAT once and for all, they certainly provide strong evidence for Michael Jordan. He occupies a nearly untouchable statistical echelon in terms of being a highly used and highly efficient player who dominates on both ends of the floor, even when compared to the best players from the last 40 years of NBA basketball. Doubtless, there are many ways to slice and dice this debate, but if anything, these findings make clear that any other competitor for GOAT is playing on MJ’s home court, and it’s his ball.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPublished in The Sports Scientist\n\nIn depth view of the world of Sports through the lens of Data Science, and Analytics\n\nWritten by Trevor Ram\n\nWriting about things I want to write about\n\nNo responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

It’s a topic that always sparks debate, so I figured I’d dig into the stats and the context to see what I could find. Buckle up, it’s gonna be a ride.\n\nFirst things first, I had to gather the data. I started by hitting up the usual suspects: Basketball-Reference, ESPN, *. I was looking for game logs, series results, player stats – the whole shebang. I spent a good chunk of the morning just sifting through all that information. Copy-pasting into a spreadsheet, you know the drill. It wasn’t pretty, but it had to be done.\n\nRelated posts\n\nWhat makes the Scoot Henderson shoe unique on the court? (Explore the technology behind his signature model)\n\nShaheen Holloway: A look at his coaching strategies.\n\nOnce I had the raw data, I started cleaning it up. This is where the fun really begins, right? Wrong! It’s tedious as heck. Removing duplicates, standardizing player names, making sure the dates lined up. Hours vanished into the abyss. But hey, garbage in, garbage out, so I powered through.\n\nNext, I wanted to understand the context of each Finals loss. It’s not enough to just look at the scores. Who were the opponents? Were there any major injuries? What was the team dynamic like? I dove into old articles, blog posts, even some YouTube highlights to get a better feel for what was going on behind the scenes.\n\nNow for the analysis. I looked at LeBron’s individual performance in those losses. Points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, shooting percentages – the whole nine yards. I compared his stats to his regular season averages, and to his performance in winning Finals series. I was trying to see if there were any consistent patterns or differences.\n\nThen I shifted my focus to his teammates. How did they perform in those losing efforts? Were they stepping up, or were they struggling? I looked at their scoring, their defense, their overall contribution to the team. I was trying to figure out if LeBron was carrying the team, or if there were other factors at play.\n\nOf course, I couldn’t ignore the opposing teams. Who were the key players? What were their strengths and weaknesses? What was their game plan for stopping LeBron? I broke down their defensive strategies, their offensive schemes, and their overall team chemistry.\n\nAfter all that digging, I started to form some conclusions. It became clear that LeBron’s Finals losses weren’t always about him. Sometimes, he was just outmatched by a better team. Sometimes, his teammates didn’t provide enough support. And sometimes, it was just plain bad luck.\n\nI know some people will say that LeBron’s Finals record is a black mark on his legacy. But I think it’s important to remember that he’s faced some incredibly tough competition over the years. He’s gone up against some of the greatest players and teams in NBA history. And he’s always given it his all.\n\nSo yeah, that’s my journey through LeBron’s Finals losses. It was a lot of work, but I learned a ton. And hopefully, it gave me a better understanding of what it takes to win at the highest level.\n\nRuud vs Cerundolo Prediction: Key Stats and Insights\n\nAre you searching for the surreal crossword clue answer?

In nine NBA Finals James' teams have been favorites only twice, both with the Miami Heat, winning one of two.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nHowever, LeBron still has three NBA trophies and three NBA Finals MVP awards to his name and his 15th season proved he is still in his prime.\n\nAlso check out: Lebron James’ Finals Appearances and stats\n\nHere's a look at the six NBA Finals losses of LeBron James:\n\n2007 - The First Sweep: against San Antonio Spurs (0-4)\n\nJames' first trip to an NBA Finals was one to forget.\n\nLeBron led the Cavs to their first finals in franchise history just to be swept by the Spurs.\n\nCleveland was considered underdog to a San Antonio team that won its fourth NBA title with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker all in their prime.\n\nThe then 22-year-old James and Cleveland went through a hard Eastern Conference playoff, where they defeated Washington Wizards, the New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons on their way to the finals.\n\nSan Antonio defeated the Cavs in the first two games easily. James' squad came close in games three and four, but they got swept at their home court.\n\nLeBron averaged 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 6.8 assists in the finals.\n\n2011 - The Meltdown: against Dallas Mavericks (2-4)\n\nA new LeBron James was ready to shock the world and win his first ring.\n\nJames took his talents to south beach to join Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the Miami Heat roster. James' side was the favorite and all was set to begin a new dynasty in the NBA.\n\nBut then Dallas arrived on the scene.\n\nThe Mavericks conquered their first NBA title beating the Heat in six games after being down two times.\n\nThe media criticized James for disappearing in key moments. He scored just eight points and went 3-of-11 from the field in a Game 4 loss, and in Game 6 he collapsed, especially in the second half, taking wrong decisions and passing the ball when he should have shot.\n\nAt the end of the series, the media claimed that this was the worst superstar meltdown in sports history.\n\nJames finished the finals with 17.8 points (his worst in a final), 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists a night.\n\n2014 - The Blow Out: against San Antonio Spurs (1-4)\n\nOnce again, the Spurs were the King's nightmare.\n\nSan Antonio destroyed the Miami Heat easily to win its fifth NBA championship.\n\nMiami beat the Spurs the previous season in the Finals in seven games, but this time they were blown out.\n\nLeBron had a superb series, averaging 28.2 points, 7.8 boards, and 4.0 assists a game, but Spurs' ball movement was too much for Miami's defense.\n\nSan Antonio won Game 3 (111-92) and Game 4 (107-86) on the road to close it out at home with another immense victory (104-87).\n\nThis was the last season of James with the Miami Heat as he then re-joined the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second term.\n\n2015 - Not A Dream Return: against Golden State Warriors (2-4)\n\nJames’ second term with the Cavs started with a trip to the NBA finals, the fifth in a row for him and second overall of the Cleveland organization.\n\nLeBron, a four-time MVP, fell to a young Warriors team that won their first title in 40 years.\n\nIn this year's finals, the Cavs had both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love injured, making Matthew Dellavedova the starting point guard of the team.\n\nLebron established a record, becoming the first player in NBA history to lead both teams in points, rebounds, and assists in an entire Finals series.\n\nJames ended the finals with 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 dishes per game.\n\n2017 - A Dynasty Arises: against Golden State Warriors (1-4)\n\nFor the third consecutive season, Cavs and Warriors faced each other in the NBA Finals.\n\nAnd the Dubs took round three after an outstanding performance by the Finals MVP Kevin Durant.\n\nJames' crew made history the previous season when the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 1-3 deficit in the Golden State debacle.\n\nBut this final was a different version.\n\nThe Warriors added Durant and he was in beast mode the whole series, handing the Dubs their fifth NBA trophy.\n\nLeBron averaged 33.6 points, 22.0 rebounds and 10.0 assists in the finals.\n\n2018 - The Second Sweep: against Golden State Warriors (0-4)\n\nSame teams, same story.\n\nGolden State swept Cleveland to secure its sixth NBA title.\n\nThe Cavaliers were +650 money line underdogs, according to the Westgate sportsbook in Las Vegas, the worst odds a LeBron James’s team have ever faced in his nine NBA Finals appearances.\n\nJames played with an injured right hand in the last three games. LeBron supposedly hurt his hand after punching a whiteboard in the locker room in frustration following the Game 1 loss when his teammate JR Smith inexplicable drove away from the basket instead of shooting with four seconds remaining and the game tied.\n\nJames ended the final with 34.0 points, 8.5 rebounds and 10.0 assists per game after leading the Cavs in a season full of turbulence.\n\nJosé Quintero\n\nI'm from Venezuela.\n\nI've worked covering local and major sports leagues in m country and as well as the different Venezuelan National Teams. \n\nI also write for other international websites.\n\nNow based in Valencia, VEN.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

            "raw_content": "Sports. Honestly. Since 2011\n\nLebron James: In Defense of Six Finals Losses\n\nThough LeBron James has become synonymous with the NBA Finals, ever since left the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2010, he has become the most criticized player in NBA history.  This criticism goes no farther than James’ 3-6 NBA Finals record.\n\nDefending LeBron James’ NBA Finals Losses\n\nLeBron James’ Three Finals Wins\n\nJames has been successful throughout his career, and winning three championships is no small feat. Two of these, 2013 and 2016, were both game seven wins where James played outstanding.  He has also been the finals Most Valuable Player every time. The highlight though was coming back from a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors, led by unanimous Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry.\n\nThe Six Finals Losses\n\n2007: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nLeBron’s 3-6 finals record is not very good, only winning one-in-three of his trips made to the NBA Finals. However, he has also had some of the worst luck in history. In his first appearance back in 2007, James carried the Cleveland Cavaliers at 23 years old.\n\nThe King would run into the San Antonio Spurs at their peak. The Cavaliers were low on experience, were not nearly matching the talent, and also were severely out-coached.  Nobody expected them to even make the finals, so James really overachieved this season.\n\n2011: Dallas Mavericks: 4, Miami Heat: 2\n\nOh, the “LeChoke” series. LeBron James averaged 18 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, and for him, that is terrible. There really is no defending James here specifically, but it is unfair that he catches all the flak.\n\nDirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks swept Kobe Bryant’s two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. Bryant, too, would not play very well. The Mavericks would also follow up that series by taking out Kevin Durant, James Harden, and Russell Westbrook in five games.\n\n2014: San Antonio Spurs: 4, Miami Heat: 1\n\nThis series was one of the many James versus a super team series. Not only did he have to deal with the monstrous defense of Kawhi Leonard, but he would also face Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, and Tony Parker. James led the series in points per game by ten points, averaging 28 points, eight rebounds, and four assists.\n\nJames had little help, as Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were both showing early signs of age and were struggling mightily this series. The Miami Heat had a thin bench, and the Spurs bench was maybe the best in the league. No Miami players performed well, and the Spurs were excellent outside of even their best players. James was outmatched and faced a double-team against multiple excellent defenders.\n\n2015: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 2\n\nThis was the first win of the Golden State Warriors dynasty, and the first season James returned to Cleveland. This series should have been won by Cleveland as they were better, but they were all injured. Before the playoffs, Brian Windhorst reported that LeBron James had five different injuries. James had already dealt with a lower back injury earlier in the season.\n\nObviously, the real reason that the Cavaliers did not come away with the title was the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Love suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Boston Celtics in the first round. Irving would fracture his kneecap in game one of the NBA Finals.\n\nJames would play like a monster, leading each team in every statistical category. He led every game in points scored except for game four and led the game in rebounds three out of the six games. James averaged 36 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists for the series. This is a forgotten performance in the long biography of James’ NBA Finals appearances.\n\n2017: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 1\n\nRound three of the Cavaliers versus Warriors war was heavily favored to the Warriors. Golden State signed Kevin Durant on July 4th, 2016 after blowing a 3-1 lead to Cleveland a month prior.  This was viewed as a move that locked the Warriors in as 2017 champions. It was heavily believed that Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Draymond Green would walk through the season. This was correct, as they went 16-1 in the playoffs.\n\nJames, despite playing like a monster, was heavily outmatched. He averaged 34 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, but nothing he did could have been enough. The Warriors were too good, and there was not much to be done about it.\n\n2018: Golden State Warriors: 4, Cleveland Cavaliers: 0\n\nPrior to these finals, it is worth noting that many expected the Toronto Raptors to be the team to lose to the Warriors in 2018. James had one of the worst supporting casts in his career. He would lead the entire playoffs in both points and assists. James was the only player on the Cavaliers to score 20+ points in the first round but still won the series. The next round he would sweep the Raptors in the famous “LeBronto” series. James would single-handedly beat a very deep Celtics team, a team that was much better coached. Every team James and the Cavaliers faced were better than them, but James simply played the best basketball of his career.\n\nRound four, the conclusion of the Cavaliers versus Warriors finals, saw a clean sweep. Kyrie Irving was gone, the Warriors were the same, and James had no arsenal. This series’ highlight is George Hill missing a free throw with J.R. Smith thinking Cleveland was up one. James actually visibly called a timeout, but like usual, got no help from the referees. After this move, it looked like the end. James had dominated, but the overtime saw Golden State take over. When LeBron James scores 51 points while adding eight rebounds, and you lose, there is no hope.\n\nJames averaged 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists. The most impressive is the 10 assists though, as that means James’ teammates actually made more than 10 shots.  Basically, this was the worst supporting cast in memory. If James won this series, he would have been the undeniable GOAT.\n\nMain Photo:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nChris Gallagher\n\nShare:\n\nMore Posts\n\nMore Details Emerge Why Denver Dismissed Malone & What’s Next for The Nuggets?\n\nJust like when Memphis relieved Taylor Jenkins from his duties on March 8, there appeared to be an uproar or surprise at the Denver Nuggets\n\nHow Concerning is Jaylen Brown’s Injury?\n\nBoston Celtics star Jaylen Brown is currently dealing with a knee injury.

The Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics (64–18) played the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls (72–10), with the Bulls holding home court advantage. The teams' 136 combined regular season wins shattered the previous record of 125, set in 1985 between the Los Angeles Lakers who won 62 games and the Boston Celtics who won 63 games in the past regular season. The series, the 50th NBA finals in league history, was played under a best-of-seven format. This was the first championship in the Chicago Bulls' second three-peat.[1]\n\nChicago won the series 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP, his fourth time winning the award.\n\nBackground\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nThe Bulls were coming off a season where they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Orlando Magic. Heading into the upcoming season, Chicago was no longer the same team as they were in their most recent championship season of 1993, having lost key members of their first three-peat core in John Paxson and Bill Cartwright who retired while  Horace Grant, B. J. Armstrong, Stacey King, Will Perdue, and Scott Williams left via free agency.\n\nIn their place was a new core of players such as Luc Longley, Toni Kukoč, Steve Kerr, Ron Harper, Jud Buechler, Bill Wennington and Randy Brown. But perhaps their biggest addition to the team was Dennis Rodman, a nine-year veteran who had been a rebounding champion for four straight years, and whose controversial lifestyle has been well-documented.\n\nThe result of this ensemble was perhaps the greatest regular season of any team in NBA history at the time, as the Bulls won a record-high 72 games, which would be broken by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015–16 season. They continued to gain momentum in the playoffs, beginning with a sweep of the Miami Heat in the first round, followed by a five-game defeat of the New York Knicks in the second round. The conference finals was a rematch of the previous season's series with the Orlando Magic, but it was a no-contest, as the Bulls swept the Magic to gain entry into the Finals.\n\nSeattle SuperSonics\n\nThe SuperSonics were led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, with George Karl as head coach. The team was considered a perennial title contender throughout the mid-1990s, but the closest they came to reaching the finals was in 1993, when they lost to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nTwo straight first-round exits followed, including the stunning 1994 loss to the eighth-seeded Denver Nuggets (the Sonics were the first seed in that playoffs). Motivated by a successive string of early playoff losses, Seattle finished the 1996 regular season with a franchise-record 64 wins.\n\nSeattle began its playoff run with a four-game win over the Sacramento Kings, followed by a dominant sweep of the defending champion Houston Rockets, headed by a 33-point win in Game 1 where they held Hakeem Olajuwon to 5 points. They then beat the Utah Jazz in seven games in the western finals to advance to its first NBA championship round since 1979.\n\nRoad to the Finals\n\nSeattle SuperSonics(Western Conferencechampion) |

offensively, they were able to compensate with superb defense. Frustration set in for Seattle when Frank Brickowski was ejected after committing a flagrant foul against Dennis Rodman, then promptly getting charged with two consecutive technical fouls. Chicago was leading by only 2 at the end of the third quarter, but in the final quarter, shots by Toni Kukoč and 2 key steals by Ron Harper clinched the Bulls' Game 1 win. Shawn Kemp was a bright spot for Seattle, scoring 32 points, but ended up fouling out midway through the fourth quarter. Michael Jordan led the way for the Bulls with 28 points, while Scottie Pippen chipped in with 21 points. Seattle captain Nate McMillan ended up leaving the game due to a debilitating back injury in the 2nd quarter. Dennis Rodman pulled down 13 rebounds for the Bulls, while Toni Kukoč chipped in off the bench with 18 points.\n\nGame 2\n\nNBC\nJune 79:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics88,Chicago Bulls92\nScoring by quarter:27–23, 18–23, 20–30,23–16\nPts:Shawn Kemp29Rebs:Shawn Kemp13Asts:Payton,Schrempf3 each |  | Pts:Michael Jordan29Rebs:Dennis Rodman20Asts:Michael Jordan8\nChicago leads the series, 2–0\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T.

Despite Shawn Kemp's 29 points and 13 rebounds, Chicago triumphed with a final score of 92 to 88. In the victory, Dennis Rodman tied an NBA Finals record with 11 offensive rebounds and made a clutch free throw near the end of the game to seal the Bulls victory.

In an attempt to spark his team, Coach George Karl gave Jordan's defensive assignment to Gary Payton, a move which showed immediate results.[3] Seattle succeeded with a 107–86 win over the Bulls, and Sonics fans taunted the Bulls players with homemade signs reading \"Sweepless in Seattle\".[4] The Sonics were helped by the return of team captain Nate McMillan whose presence entering the game brought the KeyArena crowd to its feet.\n\nSeattle's victory prevented the NBA Finals from being swept in two consecutive years (something which, as of 2024, has never occurred).[5]\n\nGame 5\n\nNBC\nJune 149:00 et\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nChicago Bulls78,Seattle SuperSonics89\nScoring by quarter:18–18, 24–25, 18–19, 18–27\nPts:Michael Jordan26Rebs:Dennis Rodman12Asts:Scottie Pippen5 |  | Pts:Gary Payton23Rebs:Shawn Kemp10Asts:Gary Payton6\nChicago leads the series, 3–2\nKeyArena,Seattle,WashingtonAttendance:17,072Referees:No. 42 Hue HollinsNo. 20 Jess KerseyNo. 4 Ed T.

It just took too long. We should have come with this a little earlier.\"[6] Shawn Kemp's performance in this game was considered by many to be his best in a Seattle uniform.\n\nGame 6\n\nNBC\nJune 167:30 pm\nRecapat theWayback Machine(archived October 27, 1996)\nSeattle SuperSonics75,Chicago Bulls87\nScoring by quarter:18–24, 20–21, 20–22, 17–20\nPts:Detlef Schrempf23Rebs:Shawn Kemp14Asts:Gary Payton7 |  | Pts:Michael Jordan22Rebs:Dennis Rodman19Asts:Michael Jordan7\nChicago wins the NBA Finals, 4–2\nUnited Center,Chicago,IllinoisAttendance:24,544Referees:No. 27 Dick BavettaNo. 25 Hugh EvansNo. 29 Steve Javie\nChicago won the series four games to two on Father's Day, in what would be the last time the Sonics played a Finals game before relocating to Oklahoma City and being renamed the Thunder. The Bulls' victory was partly due to the stellar performance of power forward Dennis Rodman, who delivered a repeat of his Game 2 performance with 19 rebounds, tying his own NBA Finals record. Bulls star Michael Jordan finished the game with 22 points and collected his fourth Finals MVP.\n\nAs of 2024, no NBA team has ever overcome a 3-0 playoff series deficit, and only four teams have forced a Game 7 after dropping the first three contests: the New York Knicks (1951), Denver Nuggets (1994), Portland Trail Blazers (2003), and Boston Celtics (2023).[7][8]\n\nPlayer statistics\n\nGP | Games played | GS | Games started | MPG | Minutesper game\nFG% | Field-goalpercentage | 3P% | 3-point field-goalpercentage | FT% | Free-throwpercentage\nRPG | Reboundsper game | APG | Assistsper game | SPG | Stealsper game\nBPG | Blocksper game | PPG | Pointsper game |  | \nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nRandy Brown | 6 | 0 | 8.2 | .500 | .500 | .500 | 0.3 | 0.9 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 2.8\nJud Buechler | 6 | 0 | 5.6 | .222 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.7\nRon Harper | 6 | 4 | 19.3 | .375 | .308 | .917 | 2.3 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 0.3 | 6.5\nMichael Jordan | 6 | 6 | 42.0 | .415 | .316 | .836 | 5.3 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.2 | 27.3\nSteve Kerr | 6 | 0 | 18.8 | .303 | .182 | .857 | 0.9 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 5.0\nToni Kukoč | 6 | 2 | 29.5 | .423 | .313 | .800 | 4.8 | 3.5 | 0.8 | 0.3 | 13.0\nLuc Longley | 6 | 6 | 28.3 | .574 | .000 | .727 | 3.8 | 2.2 | 0.6 | 1.8 | 11.7\nScottie Pippen | 6 | 6 | 41.3 | .343 | .231 | .708 | 8.2 | 5.3 | 2.3 | 1.3 | 15.7\nDennis Rodman | 6 | 6 | 37.5 | .486 | .000 | .579 | 14.7 | 2.5 | 0.8 | 0.2 | 7.5\nJohn Salley | 5 | 0 | 3.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nBill Wennington | 6 | 0 | 7.0 | .667 | .000 | .500 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.9\nPlayer | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG\nVincent Askew | 4 | 0 | 15.5 | .222 | .200 | 1.000 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 1.8\nFrank Brickowski | 6 | 3 | 11.3 | .222 | .200 | .000 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.8\nHersey Hawkins | 6 | 6 | 38.3 | .455 | .273 | .923 | 3.5 | 1.0 | 1.2 | 0.2 | 13.3\nErvin Johnson | 3 | 3 | 6.7 | .333 | .000 | .000 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 1.3\nShawn Kemp | 6 | 6 | 40.3 | .551 | .000 | .857 | 10.0 | 2.2 | 1.3 | 2.0 | 23.3\nNate McMillan | 4 | 0 | 12.8 | .429 | .600 | 1.000 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 2.8\nGary Payton | 6 | 6 | 45.7 | .444 | .333 | .731 | 6.3 | 7.0 | 1.5 | 0.0 | 18.0\nSam Perkins | 6 | 0 | 31.7 | .377 | .235 | .810 | 4.7 | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 11.2\nSteve Scheffler | 4 | 0 | 2.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDetlef Schrempf | 6 | 6 | 39.7 | .443 | .389 | .875 | 5.0 | 2.5 | 0.5 | 0.2 | 16.3\nEric Snow | 6 | 0 | 1.5 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\nDavid Wingate | 6 | 0 | 8.0 | .500 | .500 | 1.000 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 2.5\nBroadcasting\n\nThe Finals was aired in the United States on NBC. Bob Costas hosted the pre-game, halftime and post-game show with analysts Julius Erving and Peter Vecsey. Games were called by Marv Albert, Matt Guokas and Bill Walton, while Ahmad Rashad and Hannah Storm served as sideline reporters.\n\nThe local NBC stations of the participants were WMAQ-TV (Chicago) and KING-TV (Seattle).\n\nAftermath\n\nThe 1996 NBA Finals would be the last Finals appearance of the Seattle SuperSonics. The Sonics would win the Pacific Division again in 1997 and 1998, but fell in the second round of the playoffs each time. The series was George Karl's only Finals appearance in his coaching career. In 2008, the Sonics franchise moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder. They would make the finals four years later after the move, losing to the Miami Heat in five games.\n\nThis was also the last time a Seattle-based team played for a major professional sports championship until Super Bowl XL in 2006, when the Seattle Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Seahawks would go on to handily defeat the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and lose to the New England Patriots the following year in Super Bowl XLIX. In terms of overall sports leagues, the city would later enjoy six additional championships: the WNBA's Seattle Storm, a one-time SuperSonics sister team, won the 2004, the 2010, the 2018, and the 2020 WNBA Finals, and the MLS's Seattle Sounders FC won 2016 MLS Cup and 2019 MLS Cup.\n\nTeams from Chicago and Seattle would meet three more times in postseason competition among the \"Big Four\" leagues. The only time Seattle won over Chicago was in the 2000 American League Division Series, when the Seattle Mariners swept the Chicago White Sox 3–0. Meanwhile, the Seahawks lost to the Chicago Bears in the divisional round of both the 2006 and 2010 NFL playoffs.\n\nThe Bulls came close to winning 70 games for the second straight year, instead settling for a 69-win campaign in 1997. They won their second straight title over the Utah Jazz in six games of the 1997 NBA Finals. In the off-season that preceded Scottie Pippen became the first person to win the NBA championship and an Olympic gold medal in the same year twice, playing for Team USA at the Atlanta Olympics.[9] The Bulls would also defeat the Utah Jazz in six games in the 1998 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Bulls' combined 87 wins in the regular season and postseason would stand as an NBA record until the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors, coached by former Bull Steve Kerr, broke it with 88 total wins (thanks to the first round using a best-of-7 format instead of the best-of-5 in 1996), including a 73–9 regular season mark. However, the Warriors lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals, failing to repeat as champions after beating the same Cavaliers in the previous Finals.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes and

Michael Jordan is one such a figure for he revolutionized basketball and arguably helped redefine how people view athletes and sports for the rest of the world. Legendary performances, and awards that almost can’t be numbered, Michael Jordan’s accomplishments over the course of his career would indeed include cultural impact far beyond the court. Champions of the Chicago Bulls, changing trends in fashion, marketing, and the global reach of the sport, he altered his legacy as uniquely as any other such person, Michael Jordan.\n\nThis paper traces how Michael Jordan reshapes the course of basketball and stamps his footprint permanently on the world of sports culture, that covers the Michael Jordan career and impacts lastingly.\n\nGrowing Up and The Road to Glory Michael’s education in basketball began when, famously, he did not make the varsity team as a sophomore. This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

Revered by fans across continents, Jordan’s mastery on the basketball court and his pioneering role in sports marketing reshaped the NBA’s appeal, sneaker culture, and even how athletes engage with fans off the court. This article explores how Jordan revolutionized both basketball and the sportswear marketing industry, leaving an enduring influence on future stars, brand partnerships, and consumer expectations.\nAthletic Dominance and Pivotal Moments\nMichael Jordan’s six NBA championships, five MVP awards, and a string of iconic highlights (including “The Shot” and “The Flu Game”) cemented him as a singular talent. His flair for clutch performances made the Chicago Bulls must-watch entertainment, boosting television ratings and turning casual viewers into devoted followers.\nJordan’s relentless competitiveness and showmanship also encouraged his rivals to elevate their games. His style of play—combining mid-air acrobatics, fadeaway jumpers, and defensive tenacity—became the standard by which future superstars would be judged. Each dazzling dunk or buzzer-beater captured imaginations worldwide, fueling the notion that basketball could be as captivating and global as soccer or any other major sport.\nInternational Appeal and the 1992 Dream Team\nJordan’s impact went beyond American borders, particularly in 1992 when he led the U.S. “Dream Team” at the Barcelona Olympics. For many international viewers, that squad offered a first glimpse of NBA-caliber play, with Jordan at the forefront of the spectacle. Fans from Europe, Asia, and beyond quickly identified Jordan’s name with the pinnacle of basketball excellence. This exposure significantly accelerated the NBA’s global expansion, setting the stage for worldwide fan bases and paving the way for international stars to enter the league.\n\nImage Credits: Fadeaway\nA Revolutionary Partnership\nIn 1984, Nike signed Michael Jordan to a then-unprecedented rookie endorsement deal worth $2.5 million. The collaboration launched the Air Jordan 1 in 1985, featuring a striking red-and-black color scheme that clashed with NBA uniform rules and was initially “banned.” This controversy only heightened the line’s allure, sparking interest in both the shoes and Jordan’s charismatic persona. Over subsequent releases, each Air Jordan model introduced inventive design elements, ensuring each sneaker felt like a milestone in Jordan’s career.\n\nSource: Nike\nCultural Phenomenon and Economic Might\nThe Air Jordan brand grew into a fashion and cultural statement, blending basketball performance with street style. Limited-edition releases and retro reissues maintain feverish consumer demand, sometimes selling out in minutes. By 2024, the Air Jordan line exceeded $5 billion in annual revenue—an astonishing figure that underscores its ongoing relevance decades after Jordan retired from professional basketball.\nBeyond footwear, these partnerships shaped a new approach to athlete endorsements. Jordan wasn’t just a pitchman—he was at the creative core of the brand, influencing product aesthetics and storytelling. His synergy with Nike demonstrated that marketing a sneaker could transcend sport, appealing to fans of hip-hop, urban fashion, and mainstream pop culture.\n\nImahge Credits: Pintrest\nJordan’s Blueprint for Modern Athletes\nAthlete as a Brand\nPrior to Jordan, endorsements were generally transactional. Jordan proved an athlete could embody an entire brand identity, setting a precedent for names like LeBron James, Roger Federer, and Cristiano Ronaldo to negotiate deeper involvement in product design and marketing strategy. Rather than just modeling shoes in print ads, Jordan co-created an emotional narrative that connected each sneaker release to a significant moment, forging loyalty far beyond typical fan devotion.\nEmotional Storytelling and Authenticity\nFrom Gatorade’s “Be Like Mike” campaign to McDonald’s commercials, Jordan’s marketing leaned on emotional resonance and youthful aspiration. Fans saw him as the driven underdog who rose to dominance through relentless work ethic. Advertisers recognized the authenticity behind Jordan’s competitiveness, tapping into that emotional authenticity to inspire viewers. This approach turned every product endorsement into a mini storyline, bridging sports and personal motivation.\nWidening Paths for Future Stars\nJordan’s success paved the way for athletes to become brand ambassadors, partial owners, or co-creators of signature lines. High-profile partnerships like Kevin Durant’s KD brand with Nike or Serena Williams’s design input with her sponsors owe a debt to Jordan’s trailblazing. Modern superstars often emulate Jordan’s trajectory, blending on-field performance with off-field entrepreneurial ventures.\nSneaker Culture and Street Fashion: A Lasting Legacy\nAir Jordan in Streetwear\nWhen the Air Jordan 1 arrived, it crossed an invisible boundary—shoes once reserved for basketball courts suddenly became coveted lifestyle accessories. B-boys, skateboarders, and rap icons alike integrated Jordans into their wardrobes, turning them into cultural symbols of status and flair. This shift established a new trend: performance sneakers could be as much about self-expression as athletics.\nLimited Releases and the Resale Market\nThe brand leveraged scarcity to fuel excitement—limiting production runs or distributing special editions that collectors scrambled to acquire. This approach to hype marketing remains standard practice among modern sneaker releases and streetwear collaborations, such as Supreme or Off-White. Rare Jordan models command steep resale prices, illustrating how Jordan’s brand turned functional footwear into cultural artifacts.\nExpanding into a Global Business\nOver time, Jordan Brand partnerships extended beyond basketball, aligning with designers or celebrities for innovative lines. These collaborations continuously refresh the brand’s identity, engaging audiences that might never have watched an NBA game. Whether a sneaker drop features futuristic materials or references nostalgic colorways from Jordan’s Bulls era, each product taps into a sense of heritage and exclusivity.\n\nImage Credits: Newatlas\nSocial Activism and Evolving Criticism\nPhilanthropy and Social Involvement\nCritics once argued Jordan avoided political stances or activism during his prime. Later in life, he demonstrated a more overt philanthropic and social conscience, donating millions to initiatives focusing on youth education, racial equality, and community development. This shift parallels a broader expectation for high-profile athletes to leverage their platforms for social causes, reflecting how influential Jordan’s brand identity has become.\nEthical Manufacturing Concerns\nNevertheless, the success of Jordan’s brand, manufactured largely overseas, is not free from scrutiny. Nike’s supply chain controversies over labor standards occasionally surface in media discussions about exploitation in factories. This tension highlights the complexities big sportswear brands face—balancing brand equity, consumer demand, and corporate responsibility.\nMarketing Lessons from Michael Jordan’s Empire\nMichael Jordan’s transformation of both basketball and sportswear marketing offers essential insights for modern brands, entrepreneurs, and athletes:\n\nThe Power of Unique Partnerships\nBy co-developing products instead of merely endorsing, Jordan built enduring synergy. Modern athletes and brand owners can replicate this co-creation model for deeper consumer engagement.\n\n\nEmotional Narratives Create Loyalty\nFrom “Be Like Mike” to the story behind each Air Jordan release, emotional storytelling fosters a personal connection. Audiences relate to both success and struggle, turning consumer relationships into something more than just sales.\n\n\nPerformance Meets Style\nA brand can straddle athletic utility and street-fashion credibility. The momentum from Jordan’s on-court achievements lent authenticity to Air Jordans, propelling the shoes into everyday wardrobes.\n\n\nScarcity and Exclusivity\nLimited-edition sneakers or exclusive brand collaborations keep hype cycles rolling, demonstrating how well-managed scarcity can boost consumer intrigue and demand.\n\n\nEvolution While Preserving Heritage\nAlthough Jordan last played an NBA game in 2003, fresh sneaker releases, colorways, and brand collaborations keep interest alive for new generations. Balancing innovation with historical references fosters both nostalgia and modern appeal.\n\n\n\nHow Did Michael Jordan Impact the World?\nMichael Jordan’s influence transcends basketball, reshaping sports, culture, and global marketing in profound ways:\n\nRevolutionizing Basketball and Globalizing the NBA:\n    Jordan’s dominance on the court, including six NBA championships and iconic performances like “The Flu Game,” elevated the NBA to a global stage. His leadership in the 1992 Olympics with the U.S. “Dream Team” introduced millions of international fans to professional basketball, paving the way for the NBA’s expansion into global markets.\nTransforming Athlete Endorsements:\n    Michael Jordan redefined athlete endorsements by collaborating deeply with brands like Nike to co-create the iconic Air Jordan line. This partnership turned sneakers into a global fashion statement and set the blueprint for modern athlete branding, influencing stars like LeBron James, Serena Williams, and Cristiano Ronaldo.\nBuilding Sneaker Culture and Streetwear:\n    Jordan’s Air Jordans broke boundaries, becoming both a basketball performance shoe and a cultural icon. His shoes shaped sneaker culture, blending sportswear with street style, and inspired an entire resale and collector’s market worth billions.\nInspiring Generations Through Emotional Storytelling:\n    Campaigns like Gatorade’s “Be Like Mike” and Nike’s emotional ads made Jordan an inspirational figure, symbolizing hard work, resilience, and excellence. His story of overcoming obstacles resonated globally, motivating countless individuals to pursue their dreams.\nDriving Social and Economic Change:\n    Jordan’s brand partnerships, philanthropic efforts, and business ventures have contributed billions to the global economy while supporting youth education, racial equality, and community development. His legacy continues to influence how athletes use their platform to effect social change.\n\nThe Enduring Importance of Jordan’s Influence\nMichael Jordan’s remarkable narrative—rising from an overlooked college athlete to a six-time NBA champion and multi-billion-dollar brand architect—represents the pinnacle of synergy between athletic success and savvy marketing. By presenting himself as both a fierce competitor and a relatable icon, Jordan bridged cultural gaps, extending basketball’s influence to areas of fashion, music, and broader entertainment. Furthermore, through strategic co-branding with Nike, Jordan established a template for athlete-driven product lines that many big names mirror today.\nFrom a marketing perspective, Jordan’s imprint looms over every subsequent sneaker hype, brand partnership, or athlete’s ambition to become a business powerhouse. Meanwhile, from a sports perspective, his blend of skill, competitiveness, and showmanship ushered in a new standard for professional basketball—and championed a global following that turned the NBA into a cultural export. This hybrid role, both on-court magician and off-court marketing genius, underscores the comprehensive impact Jordan had on shaping fans’ expectations of celebrity athletes.\nIn essence, Michael Jordan demonstrated the profound power of cohesive storytelling, authenticity, and consistent performance. His brand rests on more than highlight reels; it’s built on the ethos of excellence—a pursuit that resonates with fans of basketball and style enthusiasts alike. Today’s sports economy teems with athlete collaborations and signature lines, all traces of a legacy begun by a once-overlooked player who simply refused to accept defeat, whether in the final seconds of a championship game or in the competitive world of sports marketing.\nCheck Out Marketing Strategies of Other Companies\n\nRed Bull\nFenty Beauty\nLouis Vuitton\nAlo\nZara\nVictoria Secret\nAritizia\nTesla\nBMW\nMercedes-Benz\nPorsche\nFenty Beauty\nSony\nDuolingo\nAdidas\nNike\nMcdonald's\n\n\nDisclosure: This list is intended as an informational resource and is based on independent research and publicly available information.

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nBreaking Down Michael Jordan's NBA Legacy and Impact on the Game\n\nMichael Jordan meant more to basketball than six rings.\n\nHad someone like Shaquille O'Neal won those titles, it wouldn't have had the same impact. MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "How Michael Jordan And the Bulls Inspired the World\nThe year is 1992. \nHere I am, a Peruvian kid in Lima, a city going through economical and internal conflict but alsoâand just like the rest of South Americaâwelcoming the initial effects of modern American culture. \nSaved by the Bell is reaching the heights of its popularity ,and even though itâs been almost year since its release, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze is still playing in movie theaters across the capital. \nMcDonalds were expanding across the city, right next to cevicherias, and everyone wanted G.I. Joe action figures for Navidad. \nThanks to developments in television streaming and market consumption, American products were placing an imprint all over the world, and it was no different in Peru. \nWe also felt the U.S. takeover in sports. Sure, soccer was still the absolute dominant national force, but thanks to the introduction of international cable, Peruvians were now also watching NBC and ESPN, and their fandom habits were diversifying. \nAnd this is when the NBA entered the party.\nIf you ask any Peruvian who grew up in the '90s, they will tell you that their memories, in one way or another, always came back to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Itâs hard to explain this to an American reader, but for South Americans, MJ opened a door that signified more than just basketball. It was as if we realized there was another way you could define an athlete and cultural icon.\nSo here we are, back in '92. I remember the moment so vividly.\nItâs May, less than a month away from my 11th birthday, and Iâm staying over at my close friend Alonsoâs house to watch Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals between the Bulls and my New York Knicks. (I had already made this decision based on my love for John Starks, my favorite player.) Itâs not official, but I am willing to bet my life savings that Alonso was also the biggest NBA fan in Peru at the time. He was obsessed with the game. Obsessed.\nMiguelito Jordan, as my dad called him, and his Bulls returning as the defending champions, are now doing something quite remarkable off the court.Â And this was being felt everywhere, even in Peru.\nI didnât know it at the time, but years later, when I started to work in the sports industry, I realizedÂ seeingÂ thatÂ specific Game 7 (Chicago won 110-81) and watching it with my friend essentially proved to me that sports was more than just a game. It was a cultural movement. And thatâs what Michael Jordan and the Bulls did for a chubby Peruvian kid in the '90s.\nThe '90s, you see, was not just a glorious time for the league in America. It was a pivotal moment for the world of sports because Miguelito was rewriting the way weâthe worldâlooked at superstars.\nI reached out to Alonso (Guzman) for this piece because I wanted to make sure my memories were more than just nostalgia. \nWithout a beat, he concurred. \nâHonestly, at the beginning of 1991, my life changed because I discovered basketball and the Bulls embellished my love for the sport,â says Alonso, now an illustrator and writer in Lima. âAnd even though itâs widely accepted that the Dream Team lifted the game to epic global proportions in â92, Iâd actually argue it was the '90s Bullsâalongside satellite TVâwho were responsible for the start of this phenomena. Especially where we grew up.â\nFor Alonso, his love for Michael Jordan and the Bulls was also personal. âWatching them became a means of bonding with my dad,â he says. âI remember how he used to talk about their great chemistry, the grace of Scottie Pippen, the strength of Horace Grant and later Dennis Rodman, the clutch play of John Paxson and later Steve Kerr. And as the seasons went by, we became one while watching their games, and even congratulated each other for a good job after every championship clincher. It was as if we were two of 'the guys'. And whenever I watched Phil Jackson on TV, I saw my dad: a throwback grey-haired man who was strict, but also very kind.\nâThe endless summer days in which I saw more hardwood than sun, all the ups and downs of the seasons (including the '93-'94 team) and that final Bulls salute after Game 6 of the 1998 Finals, when I embraced my dad in the same fashion as Jordan and Phil Jackson. We saw history together, and all those precious moments will remain with me forever.â\nAfter our conversation, he confessed to me that though this team was important to him, he didnât realize just how much the Bulls meant until he realized they were a connector, a bridge that united father and son. \nThe '93-'94 seasonâas any NBA fan remembersâcame with change like no other for many reasons. The Bulls were without MJ, and due to the fragility of the nation, my family and I left Peru for England. \nItâs not a surprise to say the culture shock changed me, and life in the United Kingdom transformed almost everything about me. Here I was, no longer a Peruvian, but now also an immigrant, having to acclimate myself to a new world, a new society and a distinctively different way of life.\nAt first, due to my basic knowledge of English, making friends was difficult. But one of the saving graces were my Air Jordan VII sneakers, my knowledge of U.S. pop culture and, most importantly, Michael Jordan. This immediately became a conversation starter, and slowly, piece by piece, I felt more comfortable in my new home. \nHave you ever seen Fresh Off the Boat? That was my lifeâthe Lima-to-London version. I was a foreigner in a new land using pop culture and sports as my Get Out of Jail passes. \nAgain, just like in Peru, soccer was still the ultimate sport in the country and my first love, but the NBA, Jordan and the Bulls were once again the major influencers in '90s England, especially for young people.\nChannel Four in England was the vehicle that introduced U.S. sports to British audiences. In the '80s, the network broadcasted the NFL and achieved success in viewership so the mid '90s was naturally a move for the NBA. Showing the '96-'97 season was a major step for the network. The deal to broadcast the league became the biggest move since making a similar agreement with Serie A soccer, also an incredibly popular league at the time. The show would be called NBA 24/7,Â and almost every single British teenager watched it religiously. \nThe year is now 1998. I am a junior in high school and fully accustomed to English life.  Jordan the Bulls are still iconic and heading to their sixth title. Most importantly, from a personal standpoint, his poster is still hanging on my wall, right next to my other sports hero Dwight Yorke (though his poster would come down the same year after leaving Aston Villa for Manchester United). \nIn England, the NBA didnât just attract the attention of young British fans, but it also represented minorities, especially the black British community. The NBA, therefore, appealed to people of color in England because, as mentioned earlier, it was more than just a sport; it was a symbol of cultural representation.\nâLike many teenagers growing up in London, a love of the NBA came from watching rap stars on MTV, and all I wanted to do was emulate their style, while rapping into a hairbrush in the mirror,â says James Chinery, now an English teacher and educator in Greater London. He is also a good friend from my college years. Like Alonso, James was influenced by U.S. cultureâespecially Jordan and the Bulls. âFirst, it was the Raiders cap and jacket, which were almost like school uniforms growing up in North London. Then quickly, the legend that was Michael Jordan took over the consciousness. Jordan trainers, t-shirts, hoodies, caps, posters on wallsâyou name it, we all wanted it.â\nJamesâs love for MJ and the Bulls elevated after subscribing to Slam Magazine and staying up until midnight to watch theÂ NBA 24/7 on Channel Four, and his overall view of the world changed because of this team. âMy daily cartoon drawings changed from black superheroes to street ball players,\" he says. \"But whatever I drew, they were wearing Jordans and a Bulls cap. To this day, I still religiously wear my AJ3âS when Iâm not at work.â\nMy immigrant story is a testament to this very notion: Michael Jordan and the '90s Chicago Bulls offered the worldânot just Americaâa new meaning to sports and superstardom. Their success sparked an international spectacle, idolized and adulated.\nAnd this Peruvian kid will never forget it.Â Â \nLuis Miguel Echegaray is a reporter, producer and head of Latino/Spanish content with Sports Illustrated.

Can you guess the scoring progressions throughout their careers?\n\n\nAn elite scorer from Day 1, Kareem averaged 28.8 points as a rookie in 1969-70. He scored 14,211 points in six seasons in Milwaukee, then headed to L.A. He reached the top 10 in 1977, passed Wilt Chamberlain to become the all-time leader in 1984 and retired in 1989.\n\nEntering the NBA in 2003 out of high school, LeBron began his journey up the scoring ranks at a similar pace to Kareem. LeBron’s the youngest player to reach 10K, 20K and 30K career points and has averaged 25+ points for 19 straight seasons.\n\n\nEntering the 2022-23 season, it was not a question of if – but rather when – LeBron would break Kareem’s all-time scoring record.\n\nLeBron’s Evolution As A Scorer\n\n\nLeBron’s path to the all-time scoring title has included over 14K baskets, 2K 3-pointers, and 8K free throws. Looking at shot charts from his rookie season until now will show how his shot selection has changed over the past 20 seasons.\n\nAs a rookie, LeBron averaged 20.9 PPG. He was, as always, effective in the paint, but shot a career-low 29.0% from 3-point range.\n\nIn 2012-13 with Miami, LeBron remained dominant in the paint, but also had his most efficient season from deep — shooting 40.6% from 3-point range – providing a preview to next evolution of his scoring.\n\nIn his last two seasons with the Lakers, you can see how LeBron’s scoring has evolved, shifting more towards the perimeter. This transformation has ensured LeBron’s prolonged greatness.\n\n\nWhich teams did LeBron score the most against?\n\n\nLeBron’s tortured many fan bases across the NBA over the past 20 seasons. From his career-best 61-point game against Charlotte, to his multiple 50+ point games against Washington, New York and Milwaukee, here’s a look at which teams he’s scored the most points against.\n\nNo team has allowed more points to LeBron James than the Milwaukee Bucks. LeBron has scored 1,749 points in 61 career games vs. Milwaukee for an average of 28.7 PPG.\n\nDuring his 11 seasons in Cleveland, over two stints, LeBron scored more points against the Chicago Bulls (1,217) than any other opponent.\n\nDuring his four-year run with the Heat from 2010-2014, LeBron scored more points against the Charlotte Bobcats (Charlotte Hornets franchise) than any other opponent.\n\nSince joining the Lakers in 2018, LeBron has scored more points against the San Antonio Spurs (409) than any other opponent.\n\nHere is another look at LeBron’s scoring against all opponents\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Cavaliers\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Heat\n\nHere’s the breakdown with the Lakers\n\nAssisting The King\n\n\nOf LeBron’s 14,040 field goals made, 5,220 have been assisted by a teammate entering Tuesday night. Which players have set up LeBron to score most frequently during his time in Cleveland, Miami and Los Angeles?\n\nLeBron and Dwyane Wade spent four seasons together in Miami and half a season as teammates in Cleveland. During that time, Wade assisted on 361 of LeBron’s made baskets, the most of any teammate. The partnership was reciprocal as LeBron assisted Wade 428 times.\n\nOver LeBron’s 11 seasons in Cleveland, no player set up scoring opportunities for LeBron more than Eric Snow with 292 assists.\n\nOf Dwyane Wade’s 361 assists to LeBron, 337 came during their four years as teammates in Miami. Mario Chalmers ranked second with 271 assists to LeBron with the Heat.\n\nThis is the second season that LeBron and Russell Westbrook have been teammates with Russ dishing 168 assists to LeBron, the most of any Laker during LeBron’s four-plus seasons in L.A.\n\nHere are the players that assisted LeBron grouped together by team. Click the play button or use the scroll to see his top connections season by season.\n\n\nHere is a look at the top players that assisted LeBron throughout his career. Use the dropdown to sort by season.\n\n\nLeBron’s Go-To Scoring Moves\n\n\nWhile Kareem dominated opponents with his signature Skyhook, LeBron’s scoring has come from all over the court on a variety of shot types: from thunderous dunks to fadeaway jumpers.\n\nHe even took a few hook shots of his own.\n\nJump shots have been a staple of LeBron’s scoring, accounting for at least 30% of his offense in all but one season.\n\nThis season, layups have surpassed jumpers as the biggest slice of his scoring pie, which can be seen here, and split between home and road games.\n\nA year-by-year breakdown of every shot type from LeBron by total points scored.\n\nA Three-Level Scorer\n\n\nWhen LeBron passes Kareem in scoring, he’ll do so while making nearly 1,800 fewer baskets. LeBron makes up the gap with an additional 1,300+ free throws and over 2,200 3-pointers (compared to Kareem’s 1).\n\nTrack how LeBron’s scoring on 2s, 3s and free throws has evolved over the course of his career.\n\nA season-by-season look at LeBron’s scoring splits between free throws, 2-pointers and 3-pointers based on percentage of total points. LeBron’s percentage of points on 3-pointers went from 11% in his rookie season to 28% last season in L.A.\n\nA season-by-season look at LeBron’s scoring splits, using total points scored rather than percentages. LeBron (2,478 points in 2005-06) and Kareem (2,822 points in 1971-72) both posted their highest single-season points total in their third season.\n\nLeBron’s scoring splits divided by team, looking at percentage of points scored.\n\nLeBron’s scoring splits divided by team, looking at total points scored.\n\n\nNBA Organization\n\nNBA ID\nNBA Official\nNBA Careers\nNBA Fan Code of Conduct\n\nNBA Initiatives\n\nNBA Total Health\nNBA Cares\nJr. NBA / Jr. WNBA\nNBA Foundation\nSocial Justice Coalition\n\nAcross The League\n\nNBA Communications\nLockervision\nNBA Transactions\n\nShop\n\nGlobal Stores\nNYC Store\nNBA Auctions\nNBA Photostore\n\nSubscriptions\n\nLeague Pass\nCustomer Support\n\n\n"

            "raw_content": "Contents\nLeBron James\n\n\nLeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"King James\", he is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and is frequently at the center of debates regarding the sport's all-time best, often being compared to Michael Jordan.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers, three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nIn addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and sixth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 21 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history, with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA history.[7]\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[8] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[9] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[10] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship, ending the Cleveland sports curse, and winning his third Finals MVP.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers.\n\nOff the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[14][15]\n\nEarly life\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22  His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23 \n\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24  The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27  In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22]\n\nHigh school\nBasketball\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\n\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104  With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117  St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114  Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30]\n\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play several nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142  Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[16]: 143 [31] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178  and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[32]\n\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[33] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[32] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[32] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[34] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[35] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[36]\n\nFootball\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51  He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[37] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[38] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b]\n\nProfessional career\nCleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[43] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[44] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[9] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[45] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[46] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[47]\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[48] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[49] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[50] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[50] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[51]\n\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[52] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[53] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[54] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[55] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[56] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[57]\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[60] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[65] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[66] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[67]\n\nIn February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[68] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[69] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[70] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[71] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[72] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[73]\n\nAt the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79]\n\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5]\n\nIn February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[88]\n\nMiami Heat (2010–2014)\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98]\n\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[103][104][105] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[106] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[107][108] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[109][110] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[111][112] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[110][113][114]\n\nJames officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[115][116] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[117] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[118] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[119] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[120][121] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[122]\n\nThroughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[123] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[124] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[123] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[125] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[126] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[127] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5]\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[128] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[129] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[130] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[128] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[131] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[132]\n\nThe 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[133][124][134] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[123] Behind his expanded skillset,[134] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[135] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[136]\n\nIn the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[138] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[139] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[140][141] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[142] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[143] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[144] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[145] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[146] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[147]\n\nIn February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[148][149] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[150] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[151] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[152] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[153] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5]\n\nIn Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[154] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[155] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[156] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[157] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][156][158] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[159] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[160] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[161]\n\nOn March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[162] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[163] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[164] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[165] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[166] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[167] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[168] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[169]\n\nReturn to Cleveland (2014–2018)\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[170] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[171] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[172][173][174] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[175] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[176] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[177]\n\nIn January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[180] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[181] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[182] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[182] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[183] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[184] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[183]\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[185][186] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[187] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[187] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[188]\n\nTo begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[189] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[190] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[191] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[192] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[189] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[193]\n\nThe 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[194] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[195] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[196] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[197] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[198] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[199] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[200]\n\nPrior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[201] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[202] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[203] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[204] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[205] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[206] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5]\n\nIn the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[207] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[208][209] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[210] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[211] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[212]\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (2018–present)\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[213] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[214] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[215] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[216] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[217]\n\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[218][219] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[220] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[221] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[222] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[223] the first major injury of his career.[224] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[223] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[225] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[226] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[227] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[228]\n\n\"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'.

At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[420] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics.\n\nPlayer profile\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[421] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[422] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[134] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[423][424][425] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[426][427]\n\nOffense\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[429] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[430][431] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[432] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[134] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[433][434] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[435] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[436] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[437] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[438]\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[134] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[134][439] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[440] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[441] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[442] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[443] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][444] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[445] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[435]\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[446] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[447] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[448] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[449] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[450] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[435] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[451][452] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[453]\n\nDefense\nAt the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[454] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[455] From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season.[456] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[457] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[458] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[459][460] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[461] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[462] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[463]\n\nLegacy\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[469] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[470] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[471] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][472] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[474][475][476]\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[484] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[485] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[486] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[487][488][489] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[488][489] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[489] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[485]\n\nIn addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[490] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[491] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[492][493][494][495][496]\n\nIn 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[497] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[498]\n\nPersonal life\nJames married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[499] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[497][500] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[501] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[502] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[503] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[504] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[505] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[506]\n\nJames's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[507] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[508]\n\nIn September 2023, ESPN reported that a new set of client names from the Biogenesis scandal had been released; included was Ernest \"Randy\" Mims, a longtime friend and business manager of James, as well as David Alexander, a well-known trainer of prominent athletes who co-owned a cold-pressed juice and smoothie business with Savannah and also served as her personal trainer. The DEA determined that there \"was never any indication that LeBron James did anything wrong.\"[509][510]\n\nHealth\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, falsely believing it to be good for his heart,[511] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[512]\n\nIn January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[513] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[514]\n\nPublic image\nJames is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[515][516] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[517] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[518]\n\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[521] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[522] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[523] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[524] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[525] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[526] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[527]\n\n\n\nMemorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[530] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[531] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[532]\n\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[533] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[528][529]\n\nActivism\nPhilanthropy\nJames has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[534] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[535] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[536] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[537]\n\nIn November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[538] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[539] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[540] I Promise Village (housing complex),[541] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[542] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[15]\n\nJames is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[543][544][545] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[546]\n\nPolitics\nThroughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[547] Those include the War in Darfur,[548] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[549] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[547] the Michael Brown verdict,[550] the death of Eric Garner,[551] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[552] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[553] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[554] Kyle Rittenhouse,[555] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[556]\n\nOn August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[557] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[558]\n\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[559] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[560] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement, with some taking to social media to use racist language against him.[561][562][563] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[564] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[565][566]\n\nIn October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[567] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[568][569][570]\n\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[571] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[572] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[572] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[573]\n\nFollowing a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[574] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[575] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[576] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[577][578] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[579]\n\nOn August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[580] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[581] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years.

That is voter suppression.\"[582]\n\nOn October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[583]\n\nMedia figure and business interests\nAccording to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire,[584] making him one of the richest celebrities.\n\nJames' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict.

Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[612] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[613][614]\n\nEntertainment\nJames and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[615] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[616] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[617] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[618] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[619] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros.

The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[643]\n\nIn November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[644] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[645] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[646] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[646]\n\nJames has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[647]\n\nIn August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C.

Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[651] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[652][653]\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[116][654][655] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[656] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[657] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[658] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[659] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[660] James began re-signing[661][662] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[175] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[663] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[664]\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlay-in\nPlayoffs\nAwards and honors\nFilmography\nFilm\nTelevision\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n"

            "raw_content": "These Are LeBron’s All-Time Best Playoff Performances, Ranked\n\nGetty Image\n\nEven for his most ardent detractors, it’s difficult to talk about LeBron James and his career without lapsing into outright obsequiousness. He’s been to six straight Finals and has three championships to show for it, and along the way he’s logged some of the most dominant individual performances in league history.\n\nEven before he started his remarkable run with the Big 3 Heat, he somehow managed to carry haphazardly-constructed Cavaliers teams to deep postseason runs, and in fact, some of his best playoff games happened during his pre-Miami days. Whether it was his play against the Pistons or those epic Wizards series in his first Cleveland run, those duels against the Spurs when LeBron was going full Flying Death Machine (shoutout Matt Moore) with the Heatles, or any of those games against The Warriors following The Return, LeBron has consistently delivered.\n\nToday, we take a look back at some of those games that have made him one of the best postseason performers the NBA has ever seen.\n\n10. Game 4, 2010 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Bulls\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofMwRzJynnc\n\nLeBron had a phenomenal series against a prime Derrick Rose that year, but his Game 4 outing stood above the rest. He finished with a huge triple-double of 37 points, 12 rebounds, and 11 assists and made six of his nine attempts from downtown. Cleveland would go on to win the series in five games, but get ousted by the Celtics in the second round.\n\n9. Game 3, 2015 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Hawks\n\nThe Hawks were coming off their best season in franchise history, and many thought they might pose a legitimate challenge to the Cavs, who were eyeing their first Finals appearance since LeBron Jame’s prodigal return from Miami.\n\nThe truth was that they never really stood a chance, and LeBron’s Game 3 performance was as dominant as it gets. He finished with 37 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists, and three steals. Cleveland would complete the sweep the following game.\n\n8. Game 4, 2014 Eastern Conference Semifinals Against The Nets\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQh0eg4FysM\n\nThis particular series had quite the narrative going in. The Nets had somehow managed to sweep their regular-season series against the Big 3 Heat, which left some hapless pundits wondering whether a potential second-round upset was in the cards. The short answer to that was a resounding no.\n\nLeBron James made damn sure of that. In Game 4, he tied his career playoff high by dropping 49 points on a hyper-efficient 16-of-24 shooting from the field. They’d knock off the Nets in five games, but they would end up meeting the same fate later in the Finals when the San Antonio Spurs ran a veritable basketball clinic on them that ultimately spelled the end of the Big 3 era in Miami.\n\n7. Game 5, 2006 Eastern Conference Quarter-Finals Against The Wizards\n\nThis was really the first playoff series where we got to see what LeBron James was truly capable of. In Game 3 against the Wizards, he made a clutch layup (CRAB DRBBLE!) with just a few seconds left on the clock that gave the Cavs a 2-1 series lead.\n\nWashington would even things back up in Game 4 and were on the cusp of taking Game 5 with time winding down in overtime, until LeBron was once again somehow able to drive baseline and get a game-winning layup. His final stat line was a ridiculous 45 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, on 14-of-23 shooting from the field.\n\n6. Game 2, 2009 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Magic\n\nWhat would a list like this be without one of LeBron’s most iconic moments? The Cavs had already dropped Game 1 on their home floor and were staring down the barrel of an 0-2 deficit heading back to Orlando.\n\nBut with one second remaining on the clock and Cleveland trailing 95-93, LeBron took the inbounds pass and proceeded to knock down a game-winning buzzer-beater to even the series. He finished with 35 points, five assists, and four rebounds. The celebration would be short-lived, however, as the Magic would eventually take the series in six games.\n\n5. Game 1, 2013 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pacers\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IY4fHBNxkts\n\nThe question of whether LeBron James is a crunch-time performer was put to rest years ago, and the fact that the past three performances on this list include game-winners in pressure-cooker playoff scenarios only serves to underscore that point.\n\nLeBron has had some of his best postseason battles with Paul George and the Pacers, and this one belongs right up there near the top of the list. PG13 dropped 27 points, five assists, and four rebounds in Game 1 of the 2012 East Finals, but LeBron outdueled him to the tune of a 30-point, 10-rebound, 10-assists triple-double, to go along with the game-winning layup.\n\nThis series would go the distance, but LeBron and Co. would eventually outlast Indiana in Game 7 (another phenomenal performance by LeBron, by the way) en route to the Heat’s second straight championship.\n\n4. Game 6, 2013 NBA Finals Against The Spurs\n\nWith San Antonio leading the series 3-2, Miami was on the ropes. Literally. Security had roped off the sidelines to keep fans from storming the court in anticipation of a Spurs championship victory.\n\nTo be fair, it was ultimately Ray Allen who was the hero of this game as he was responsible for one of the most clutch three-pointers in Finals history, which forced Game 7 where LeBron and the Heat would take home their second-straight title.\n\nWhat you might’ve forgotten is that LeBron put up a monster triple-double – 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists – in the process.\n\n3. Game 5, 2016 NBA Finals Against The Warriors\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q76in4JZgoM\n\nThe entire series hinged on this very game. The Cavs were facing a historically-insurmountable 3-1 deficit, and the look on LeBron’s face as he sat pensively on the sidelines during warm-ups said it all. But Cleveland had been given a gift. The Warriors’ resident bruiser, Draymond Green, had been suspended for Game 5 for his altercation with LeBron in the previous contest.\n\nLeBron took full advantage of the situation and put up a mind-boggling 41 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, and three steals. Cleveland, of course, would go on to win the next two games and take home the chip, sparking a full year’s worth of 3-1 memes that have been the bane of Golden State’s existence ever since.\n\n2. Game 6, 2012 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Celtics\n\nThe Celtics were one of the biggest roadblocks for LeBron on his path to basketball immortality. When Boston knocked the Cavs out of the second-round in 2010, it was arguably what pushed things over the edge and prompted LeBron’s move to South Beach to start the Big 3 Heat.\n\nSo they were a familiar foe in the 2012 conference finals as the Heat faced a win-or-go-home 3-2 deficit on the Celtics’ home court, not to mention the prospect of two straight disappointing seasons in Miami. But LeBron wasn’t having any of that talk as he dropped 45 points, grabbed 15 boards, and dished out five assists.\n\nThey’d go on to win Game 7 and eventually defeat the Thunder in the Finals to bring home the first championship of his career.\n\n1. Game 5, 2007 Eastern Conference Finals Against The Pistons\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaSiWClteQ\n\nAs with Michael Jordan in the early ’90s, LeBron James had to overcome a monolithic Detroit Pistons team before he could get his first taste of the NBA Finals. With the Eastern Conference Finals tied 2-2, LeBron almost single-handedly secured a Cavs win as he scored 25 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtimes and 29 out of their last 30 points overall.\n\nHe finished with 48 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. Cleveland would go on to take Game 6 to send LeBron to his inaugural Finals appearance, where he would unfortunately encounter a San Antonio Spurs team that was simply too talented and too experienced. He’d eventually exact his revenge a few years later, however.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "The Hoops Loop\n\nNBA History: Ranking LeBron James’ Top 5 Playoff Performances\n\nIntroduction & Criteria\n\nLeBron James, arguably the greatest player in NBA history, has played an equivalent of 3.5 full NBA seasons worth of Playoff basketball, 287 games, good enough for first place in NBA history. Throughout his illustrious career he has seen both highs and lows, whilst providing the basketball community with unforgettable performances for the ages. Therefore, I have tasked myself with the impossible mission of ranking, specifically, his top 5 playoff performances.\n\nTo rank a player’s performance in the NBA, let alone, LeBron James, is no small task. Therefore, to assist in being able to categorise and create an objective ranking, a set of criteria will be utilised to meet the aim of creating an accurate ranking.\n\nThe criteria is as follows:\n\nEach facet will be measured out of a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the best and 0 the worst. The total will be ranked and measured out of a scale of 50.\n\n5. 2020 Finals Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 44/50\n\nIn a closeout game with the Lakers looking to finish off the Miami Heat and lay claim to the 2020 NBA title, LeBron James was determined as ever to get another championship on his third team. The King poured in 40 points on an unbelievable 71.4 FG%, on top of this, he managed to pull down 13 rebounds and dished out 7 assists.\n\nPlaying out of his traditional Small Forward position that he has played throughout the majority of his career, and instead at the helm of the Lakers offense as the teams point guard. The high usage, touches and ultimately responsibility further emphasis how impressive of a performance he delivered in game 5, particularly, in respect to his overall efficiency.\n\nIn the end, Game 5 came down to the wire as the infamous playoff riser, Jimmy Butler, served the Lakers an ice cold 35-point triple double. The Heats defence, a Danny Green missed shot (wide open), coupled with Jimmy’s heroics put the Lakers away in the do-or-die game for the Heat. Thus, like many of LeBron’s iconic performances, the team could not match his level of effort to pull out the win.\n\n4. 2007 ECF Game 5\n\nPerformance score: 46/50\n\nAt just 22 years old, willing a poorly constructed Cavaliers roster to heights beyond anyones expectations. This performance could be considered the genesis of the legend of LeBron, where he looked like a kid playing at the local park, a video game character, mythical, to say the least.\n\nJames’ performance against the rough and tough Detroit Pistons is defined by the staple closing period of the game, where James went unconscious by putting 25 straight points on the board to edge the Cavs over the Pistons, this would position the Cavs 3-2, in an eventual series win, proving to be the pivotal moment, not only in the game but the series.\n\nThe momentum changing game would provide the Cleveland Cavaliers with a franchise first NBA Finals appearance. A historical achievement, that in hindsight, adds further weight and significance to the feats LeBron reached during game 5.\n\nIt’s not common that young superstars display such dominance, maturity and responsibility in their game, but LeBron James was able to do just that in his showing during Game 5. A performance that has yet to be toppled by the rising stars of the NBA since.\n\n3. 2012 ECF Game 6\n\nPerformance score: 47/50\n\nAt the time of Game 6, LeBron was down a 3-2 deficit to the dynastic Boston Celtics of Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. This series was on the back of the disaster showing in the previous seasons final, where the Heat fell to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nIt was a legacy game, a turning point in LeBron’s career. If they lost, would the Heat have to rethink things over and blow it up? Is LeBron capable of leading a team to the mountain top? All these questions and much more loomed over the team like a dark cloud.\n\n\n\nUnrelenting, and defiant in preserving the Miami Heat, who were on a lifeline at this point in the series. LeBron, as seen in the thumbnail image above, had a look in his eye, only comparable to a lion stalking its prey. He attacked the Boston Celtics with brute force, finesse fadeaways from the mid-post and athletic finishes around the rim.\n\nHe silenced the Celtics superteam and the raging home crowd with 45-points on 73.1% shooting, along with 15 rebounds and 5 assists. A performance that turned down the volume on the critics within the media and NBA fanbase, and proved that nothing was going to deter LeBron from getting his first ring.\n\nThis infamous game lives on as one of the most iconic games of his career, and arguably one of the greatest performances of all time.\n\n2. 2016 Finals Game 7\n\nPerformance score: 49.5/50\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, arguably the greatest NBA game of all time, the historic series comeback by the Cavaliers, scratching and clawing their way back into the series after being knocked down 3-1, against the greatest regular season team of all time.\n\nThe unquantifiable pressure emanating from Oracle Arena on June 19, 2016 could be felt through television screens halfway around the world. The stakes couldn’t get any higher, it was up to the stars to prove to the world whether they could step into the limelight. An underlying narrative was that LeBron had promised to raise a banner for the city of Cleveland, in his return from his Miami Heat stint. More pressure than ever was on Jame to deliver.\n\nAnd deliver he did. The King produced an all around masterclass, a 27 point triple-double. Additionally, an amazing stat to put into perspective just how important James was during the crucial game is that he contributed to 50% of the Cavaliers points directly, either by assist or scoring (27 points, 19 points created from assists). The unreal offensive control was complemented by stellar defense, which birthed the iconic and arguably greatest highlight of LeBron’s career “The Block”.\n\nIt was a difficult decision to not place this as the greatest game of his career due to the unreal performance on both sides of the floor, the stakes and ultimately, the outcome of the iconic game.\n\n1. 2018 Finals Game 1\n\nPerformance score: 50/50\n\nIn a series that perfectly emulates the biblical story of David versus Goliath, LeBron James established a new precedent with his Game 1 performance. Before the series began, many within the media and broader NBA community assumed that the Golden State Warriors would trample over the one man army Cavaliers in dominant and blown-out fashion. Despite the series ending in a sweep, it was held much closer than pundits anticipated, largely due to James’ historic play.\n\nIn Game 1, LeBron showed utter offensive domination, with balanced inside-out scoring throughout the competition. He finished the game with a jaw-dropping 51 points (playoff career high), to go along with a near triple double of 8 rebounds and 8 assists. On top of this, he shot 43% from the 3-point range and 59% as a whole from the field. It was the cherry on top of the cake in terms of performances during his historical 2018 playoff season run.\n\nTherefore, this performance ranks as his best in my opinion, and the greatest NBA Finals performance of all time because:\n\nShare this:\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n"

He was the one who was supposed to take over from Michael Jordan and hence was given the nickname \"King James\". From being the cover athlete of Sports Illustrated while still in high school to becoming a 4 time NBA Champion and then going on to lead with his voice on topics of social justice. Amongst many achievements and accolades James has earned on the NBA court, his greatest moment came quite possibly in March 2024 when he became the one and only player to date to ever eclipse the 40,000 mark in career points. He is the greatest success story in the league's history.\n \nMichael Jordan was the pioneer who led the NBA to the global stage back in the 90s. The heights of global fame and stardom that he achieved put him in such rare air that he is still to this day considered the greatest athlete of all time. He relentlessly pursued greatness and won 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls. After retiring he went on to become a business tycoon amassing a huge amount of wealth. A few years later he bought the Charlotte Hornets and became the first-ever American athlete to do so.\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Stats\nMichael Jordan was all about taking over the game and single-handedly outplaying his opponents with his dominant game. LeBron is a more balanced player who scores when challenged to score but his game is more about getting his teammates involved, grabbing rebounds, and doing those little things that help a team get a victory.\nCareer (Averages)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPoints27.130.1Rebounds7.56.2Assists7.45.3Steals1.52.3Blocks0.70.8Turnovers3.52.7Minutes37.938.3Field goal %50.649.73-point %34.832.7Free throw %73.683.5\nCareer (Totals)LeBron JamesMichael JordanGames1,4951,072Points40,54334,241Rebounds11,2086,672Assists11,0315,633Steals2,2752,514Blocks1,114893Turnovers5,2202,924Minutes56,70041,011\n(LeBron stats as of October 2024)\n\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Advanced Stats\nWhen one is comparing two different eras, it’s not ideal to just look at the major stats. Sometimes, advanced stats give us an insight into the playing style and a real nitty-gritty way of evaluating two different aspects of the same attribute.\nAdvanced Career StatsLeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)27.227.9Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)146.5116.1Box Plus/Minus (BPM)8.769.2Win Shares (WS)255.14214.0True Shooting % (TS%)58.8%56.9%Usage Rate (USG%)31.6%33.3%\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Playoff Stats\nNBA Playoffs are where LeBron James' talents are unleashed.

Overall, both players rank high not only in the regular season but in the postseason as well, and once again deciding the better player between the two in the postseason is still as tough as ever. In the following table, we pit LeBron James with Michael Jordan and take a look at the advanced stats of the two in the playoffs.\nAdvanced Career Stats (Playoffs)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)28.228.6Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)33.924.7Box Plus/Minus (BPM)10.211.1Win Shares (WS)55.739.8True Shooting % (TS%)58.356.8Usage Rate (USG%)3235.6\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan NBA Finals Stats\nLeBron James has been to the finals 10 times, winning the championship on four occasions.

While Jordan does lead in most of the important categories here, James is not too far behind and can still catch up before his career is over. Therefore deciding whether MJ or LeBron is better falls short in this category as well.\nAchievementsLeBron JamesMichael JordanNBA Finals appearances106Championships46Regular season MVP45Defensive Player of the Year01Finals MVP46Rookie of the Year11Scoring titles110Assist leader10Steals leader03All-Star selections2014All NBA selections2011All-Defensive selections69\nMichael Jordan vs LeBron James Net Worth\nLeBron James over his career and through other business ventures has amassed a fortune of over $1.2 billion. Basketball is the driving force behind LeBron’s wealth; when you’ve been a top player for almost 20 years, the game checks simply add up. According to Spotrac’s financial data, James has earned an impressive total of over $430 million in salary during his time in the NBA.\nKing James’ income isn’t limited to basketball, though. Other than his massive Nike contract and game checks, the Lakers star is also quite the entrepreneur. Thanks to investments in Blaze Pizza, Beats, and Liverpool FC, among other brands.\nWhile LeBron James’ net worth is nothing to look down on, he’s still nowhere near His Airness. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan’s net worth has now reached a staggering $3 billion.\nMichael Jordan didn’t make that much in the NBA. He only commanded truly massive salaries during his last two seasons in Chicago. Jordan earned $94 million in-game checks, with roughly $63 million coming in just 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nHowever, his superstar status paid dividends. Apart from his massive contract with Nike, he endorsed everything from underwear to Gatorade and also McDonald's; those deals kept the cash flowing. In retirement, he also managed to get into an elite group by becoming an owner of an NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets.\nAlso Read: LeBron James Net Worth\nHas LeBron James ever played against Michael Jordan?\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan never got the chance to play each other on the NBA court. Unfortunately for both superstars, their careers could not overlap as Jordan had made his way out of the league just a few months before LeBron stepped foot on the NBA court.\nWhile Jordan's last game in the NBA came on April 16, 2003, LeBron's first career NBA game was on Oct. 29, 2003. For die-hard fans of the NBA, a matchup between these two legends would have been something surreal, however, it may not have accounted for much as Jordan was already past his prime having turned 40 years old while LeBron on the other hand was just a rookie in 2003.\nWho is the GOAT of the NBA?\nMichael Jordan is often considered the GOAT of the NBA. At present, Jordan is the forerunner in all accolades other than All-Star appearances, All-NBA Team, and the Hall of Fame. He has a better NBA Finals record. Furthermore, he has two rings more than LeBron James. He also has three more All-Defense selections and an additional MVP award. He also holds a Defensive Player of the Year award, an accomplishment that has eluded James. LeBron's commitment to amassing his fourth ring has brought him closer to his goal - winning six or more rings.\nHowever, Jordan was not the complete player that James was. LeBron James is the only player in NBA history with 10K points, rebounds, and assists. He is in the top 10-15 of virtually every list in the league and has also become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. James also leads the league in almost every playoff statistic, having been to the NBA Finals 10 times. He is also a much better playmaker than Jordan ever was, leading the league in assists once. He has all the stats and longevity arguments in his favor over Jordan, who was mainly valued as a scorer on the offensive end. While most people would say Michael Jordan is the Greatest player of all time. Few people like Detroit Pistons rookie Cade Cunningham believe LeBron James is the greatest player.\nWho is a better player between LeBron and Jordan?\n\nImage source: CBS Sports\nLeBron James' statistics stipulate that he is the better overall basketball player. LeBron is a more efficient player, a much better passer, and a rebounder than Jordan was. Jordan, on the flip side, has a much better free throw percentage, which sustains the points-per-game statistic. The two are relatively equivalent in efficiency ratings, with Jordan being first overall in NBA history and LeBron trailing close behind at second.\nMichael averaged more steals per game, but both players are exactly even in blocks per game. Having played so many fewer games than James, Jordan's defensive capabilities do outshine the current Lakers forward. With more All-Defensive Team selections as well as an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, the edge on that side of the ball favors the former Bulls guard. LeBron has also turned the ball over more per game as well.\nThe one thing James has in his favor are all the longevity stats and these stats will continue to stack up until he calls it a day in the NBA. Till then the gap between both players will continue to increase but then again, Jordan has already achieved so much in less time. Having said that, one of the most important records that James now possesses is leading the entire NBA in the most points ever scored.\nAfter going through everything the game has to offer, the choice between the GOAT of the NBA does come down to personal taste. Both are legends of the game who have given it their all on the court, and their statistics and records are also comparable. It is difficult to pick out any one player as the GOAT since the eras are different, the rules are different, and players play in different positions, so comparing a guard with a forward is not an ideal way of arguing who is better.\nAlso read: All about Michael Jordan’s net worth\nRead Less  \nFAQs on Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James\nQ.
