        "raw_content": "Ranking Michael Jordan's greatest NBA Finals performances ever\n\nWhat can be said about Michael Jordan on a basketball court that hasn't already been said before. The greatest player of all time, the best shooting guard ever, the most talented scorer in league history, and many more such titles are used to describe the six-time champion and five-time MVP.\n\nHis Airness led the Chicago Bulls dynasty to six championships in as many Finals appearances. He's a 10-time scoring champion and a Defensive Player of the Year. In fact, he won the DPOY in the same year he led the league in scoring. Only a handful of players can ever come close to Jordan's greatness.\n\nIf we had to list Michael Jordan's records and greatest games, this article would run too long. So, let's just focus on the biggest stage of the sport: the NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nWhat are some of Michael Jordan's best NBA Finals games?\n\nMichael Jordan has several NBA Finals records. Unbeaten (6-0) in the Finals is the one everyone talks about.\n\nHe also holds the record for most points averaged in a single Finals series with 41.0 points per game in 1993. He didn't score below 30 in a single game and had three 40+ outings against the best team in the West with the reigning MVP at the time, Charles Barkley.\n\nWe're focusing on the NBA Finals, so some of his greatest playoff moments might not show up here, such as the 63-point outburst against Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics or the game-winning shot over Craig Ehlo in the 1989 first-round against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nMichael Jordan shone at any stage and even more so on the biggest one. He has some memorable moments in the championship round. Only a handful of fans can describe what they felt when he took over and dominated the 94 feet of hardwood.\n\nHere are five of the best Michael Jordan NBA Finals performances of all time.\n\nNote: We have taken points, game importance, notable moments and context into consideration for the list. These are not Jordan's five highest-scoring games.\n\n\n\n#5 Game 2 - 1991 NBA Finals vs LA Lakers\n\nIn Michael Jordan's first NBA Finals appearance, he was up against the LA Lakers dyansty with Magic Johnson.\n\nHis opponents had been to eight NBA Finals and won five rings. They were more experienced and had championship mettle, whereas the Bulls were getting their first taste of the Finals after consisently losing early.\n\nGame 1 was at Chicago and despite Jordan's 36 points and 12 assists, the Lakers won by two points (93-91) and stole home-court advantage. Jordan then realized he had to turn it up a notch. He came into Game 2 with revenge in mind, dropping 33 points and 13 assists, shooting an absurd 83%.\n\nThe Bulls blew out the Lakers by 21 points (107-86) to establish their dominance in the series.\n\n\n\nThis game had the famous \"Spectacular Move\" call by commentator Marv Albert when Jordan went up for, what seemed like a thunderous dunk, but he changed his mind mid-air and layed it up with a spin off the glass after changing his hands.\n\nThe Bulls won the series 4-1, winning four straight games.\n\n#4 Game 1 - 1992 NBA Finals vs Portland Trail Blazers\n\nThe famous \"Shrug\" by Michael Jordan in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. He was up against the Portland Trail Blazers and Clyde Drexler, who who many considered to be MJ's nemisis. This game wasn't even Jordan's highest-scoring outing of the series, as he would drop 46 points in Game 5.\n\nHowever, this opening game is more memorable because of how Jordan displayed his dominance from the opening tip. He sank six threes in the first half and had 35 points by half-time. He made his sixth 3-pointer and shrugged it off in iconic fashion.\n\nDrexler was restricted to just 16 points while MJ totalled 39 by the end of regulation.\n\nHe scored just four more points the rest of the game, as the Bulls had such a huge lead that coach Phil Jackson didn't play Jordan much in the second half. Chicago blew out Portland by a whopping 33 points (122-89).\n\n\n\nThe Bulls eventually won the series 4-2.\n\n#3 Game 5 - 1997 NBA Finals vs Utah Jazz\n\nMichael Jordan displayed his championship mettle in Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls were up against the Karl Malone and John Stockton-led Utah Jazz, and the series was tied at two games apiece. Both teams won on their home floor, and Game 5 was at Salt Lake City, Utah for Game 5 (The format in 1997 was 2-3-2 instead of the current 2-2-1-1-1 schedule).\n\nAs per \"The Last Dance\" documentary, Jordan clarified that he didn't have flu but suffered from food poisoning after eating a pizza all by himself. His mother Deloris suggested that he skip the game, but, of course, he was going to play.\n\nMichael Jordan tallied 38 points while being barely able to run around. He took several breaks and could be seen sweating buckets on the bench during timeouts. Jordan was visibly unwell, but that didn't stop him from demolishing the Jazz on their home court.\n\nNo other player on either team even touched 20 points while an ill Jordan dropped 38, seven rebounds, five assists, three steals and a block in 44 minutes as Chicago took a 3-2 lead in the Finals.\n\nThe Bulls would win the series 4-2 after icing it at home.\n\n#2 Game 4 - 1993 NBA Finals vs Phoenix Suns\n\nMichael Jordan apparently took offense when the NBA awarded Charles Barkley the 1993 MVP, as he believed he deserved it more.\n\nAs his luck would have it, the Bulls faced the Phoenix Suns and Barkley in the NBA Finals that year. Jordan was determined to get the better of Chuck and absolutely torched the Suns in that series.\n\nAs mentioned above, he averaged a whopping 41.0 points per game, the most in an NBA Finals series in league history, but his highest-scoring Finals performance came in Game 4.\n\nJordan scored 44 points in Game 3 but lost in a triple-overtime thriller. After dropping Game 3 to Phoenix, he wasn't going to let his team lose the next game.\n\nJordan started firing on all cylinders from the tip-off. He dropped a monstrous double-nickel (55) at home to lead his team to victory (111-105).\n\nHe scored 21-37 (56%) and didn't make a single 3-point shot on his way to 55. The Bulls scored 111 points in regulation, so Jordan scored half the team's points by himself. Charles Barkley put up a triple-double with 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, but that wasn't enough.\n\n\n\nThe Bulls eventually won the series 4-2.\n\n#1 Game 6 - 1998 NBA Finals vs Utah Jazz\n\nMichael Jordan's unofficial \"last game ever,\" or his last game as a Bull, was Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. Quite appropriately, he ended his Bulls career with a game-winning shot, not just a game-winning shot, though, but a championship-winning shot.\n\nJordan and the Bulls faced the Utah Jazz in back-to-back years in the NBA Final. After defeating them in 1997, Chicago had a chance to repeat in 1998. The series was 3-2 in favor of the Bulls, and a win at Salt Lake City in Game 6 would ice the championship.\n\n\n\nMJ put up a magnificent performance, dropping 45 points in 43 minutes while the entire team had 42 points combined.\n\nWith 25 seconds on the clock, the Jazz were up one point, and John Stockton passed the ball to Karl Malone, Jordan doubled at the perfect time and stole the ball.\n\nHe dribbled up the floor, broke down his defender with a crossover and made \"The Shot,\" to seal the game. A mid-range jumper that broke the hearts of the Utah crowd that night and gave Jordan's Bulls career the perfect finale.\n\nThe Bulls won the series 4-2 on the night as they won their sixth championship in eight years. Michael Jordan was the Finals MVP for all six rings.\n\nKunal Sethi\n\nKunal Sethi is a journalist who covers the NBA at Sportskeeda.

        "raw_content": "Ranking the 10 greatest NBA Finals MVP performances in league history\n\nAlmost every team to win the NBA championship often features a strong individual performance, usually from the best player in their roster. Winning the NBA Finals MVP award is a huge achievement in a player's career.\n\nIt is one of the most prestigious awards in the NBA. In fact, winning multiple NBA Finals MVP awards is considered to be a greater achievement than winning multiple regular-season NBA MVP awards.\n\nOn that note, let us have a look at the ten greatest NBA Finals MVP performances in league history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen greatest NBA Finals MVP performances in league history\n\nThe most recent winner of the NBA Finals MVP award is LeBron James, who won his fourth ring last season with the LA Lakers and also took home his fourth NBA Finals MVP award.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nJames ranks second all-time in the list of most NBA Finals MVP awards won, just behind Michael Jordan's haul of six.\n\nWe have seen all-time great performances from The King in NBA Finals over the years. Let us find out which of his performances and that of other players, find a mention in this list. So, without further ado, let's get started.\n\n#10 Dwyane Wade - 2006 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 34.7 PPG | 3.8 APG | 7.8 RPG | 2.7 STL | 47% FG.\n\nDwyane Wade produced an unbelievable performance for the Miami Heat in the 2006 NBA Playoffs.\n\nDwyane Wade delivered Miami its first championship on this day in 2006Down 0-2 to the Mavs, the Heat won the next 4Flash averaged 39.3 PPG during that streakFinals MVP at 24 ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/x5eSAwvK1V\n\nHe guided the franchise to their first NBA championship, taking advantage of the great talent surrounding him. Pat Riley was the coach of that franchise, and Shaquille O'Neal was the center. Wade especially shone during the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks and Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nWade put on a bevy of stellar performances in that NBA Finals series as the Heat overcame the Dallas Mavericks. Though the Heat lost the first two games of the series by double digits, Wade led his team to four straight wins to seal the series.\n\nHe scored 42, 36, 43,and 36 points respectively in games 3 to 6 to secure his first ring. Wade unsurprisingly earned the NBA Finals MVP recognition after becoming the first guard to average more than 30 points in the NBA Finals since Michael Jordan in 1998.\n\n#9 Tim Duncan - 2003 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 24.2 PPG | 5.3 APG | 17.0 RPG | 5.3 BLK | 49% FG.\n\nTim Duncan won five NBA titles with the San Antonio Spurs and earned three NBA Finals MVP awards during his legendary career.\n\n\"The San Antonio @spurs are your world champions!\"Tim Duncan wins his 2nd NBA Finals MVP Award in 2003! #20HoopClass #NBATogetherLive pic.twitter.com/TrzSTPf6xd\n\nIn the 2003 NBA Finals, with the Spurs and Duncan looking for their second NBA championship, the talented power forward had one of the all-time great finals series ever seen.\n\nThe Spurs handed the New Jersey Nets their second consecutive NBA Finals loss to win their second title in franchise history, with Duncan leading the charge.\n\nDuncan had a great six-game series, averaging over 24 points and 17 rebounds per game, while also showing his great defensive abilities with five blocks-a-game and a steal.\n\nIn the series-clinching game six, Duncan got close to a quadruple-double, producing 21 points, 20 rebounds, three assists, and eight blocks.\n\n#8 Larry Bird - 1986 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 24.0 PPG | 9.5 APG | 9.7 RPG | 2.7 STL | 48% FG.\n\nIn 1986, Larry Bird won his third and last NBA championship after an amazing season with the Boston Celtics. He also won his second NBA Finals MVP award that year.\n\nBird had won his first NBA Finals MVP award in 1984; he also won regular-season MVP awards in 1984, 1985, and 1986.\n\n2nd Finals MVP in 3 years, 3rd time crowned championsLarry Bird cemented his legacy on this day in 1986 when the Celtics won it all for the 16th time pic.twitter.com/EXEPF4Vrlx\n\nIn the 1986 NBA Finals against the Houston Rockets, Bird showed his prowess of doing virtually anything on a basketball court. He almost averaged a triple-double in that six-game series, scoring 48/37/94 shooting splits.\n\nBird had two triple-doubles in the series to secure his second NBA Finals MVP award.\n\n#7 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 1971 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 27.0 PPG | 2.8 APG | 18.5 RPG | 60% FG.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar arrived in the NBA after arguably the greatest high-school and college playing career in history.\n\nIn just his second season in the competition, Jabbar guided the Milwaukee Bucks to the NBA championship. In the process, he won his first regular-season MVP award and also earned the NBA Finals MVP award for the first time in his career.\n\nAfter averaging 31.7 points and 16 rebounds per game in the regular season, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar put up 27 and 18 in the NBA Finals to sweep the Baltimore Bullets and earn the first of his two NBA Finals MVP awards.\n\n#6 Hakeem Olajuwon - 1995 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 32.8 PPG | 5.5 APG | 11.5 RPG | 2.0 STL | 2.0 BLK | 48% FG.\n\nFresh off winning his first NBA championship with the Houston Rockets in his second appearance in the NBA Finals, Hakeem Olajuwon followed up his 1994 heroics for Houston with an impressive performance in the 1995 NBA Playoffs to take the sixth-seeded Rockets all the way yet again.\n\nThe Rockets successfully negotiated their way through the Western Conference in the NBA Playoffs that year, courtesy Olajuwon's solid contribution of 33 points and ten rebounds per game through the first three rounds, where he faced three teams who had won at least 59 games in the regular season.\n\nIn the 1995 NBA Finals, the Dream's stunning 32-10-5 performance helped Houston sweep the Shaquille O'Neal-led Orlando Magic; Olajuwon, in the process, won his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award.\n\n#5 LeBron James - 2016 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 29.7 PPG | 8.9 APG | 11.3 RPG | 2.6 STL |2.3 BLK | 49% FG.\n\nLeBron James led the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first-ever NBA championship in 2016 after helping them overcome a 3-1 deficit against the 73-9 Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals that year.\n\nLeBron James is the unanimous 2016 NBA Finals MVP. pic.twitter.com/L4XDDXYlaT\n\nThe King starred for the Cavaliers with unbelievable consistency at both ends of the floor, leading every major stat category throughout the seven-game series; he achieved a triple-double in the deciding game.\n\nIn the process, James won the NBA Finals MVP award for the third time in his career to become the second player (after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) to win the coveted award with two different franchises. Kawhi Leonard later joined the duo in 2019.\n\n#4 Michael Jordan - 1992 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 35.8 PPG | 6.5 APG | 4.8 RPG | 1.7 STL | 52% FG.\n\nIn his second trip to the NBA Finals, Michael Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to back-to-back championships against Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers, in the process earning his second NBA Finals MVP award.\n\nThe Finals was expected to be an enticing duel between Jordan and Drexler, but MJ quickly stamped his class, leaving Drexler, who had a decent series, trailing in Jordan's wake.\n\nJordan averaged close to 36 points per game in that six-game series while shooting 52% from the field. He scored 39 points in 34 minutes in the first game while making six 3s (then NBA record).\n\nMJ made 35 points in the first half of that game and set an NBA Finals record while setting the series ablaze with his blistering performances.\n\n#3 Shaquille O'Neal - 2001 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 33.0 PPG | 4.8 APG | 15.8 RPG | 3.4 STL | 57% FG.\n\nThe reigning champions LA Lakers reached the 2001 NBA Finals with a perfect 11-0 record in the Western Conference, beating three 50-win teams in their first three rounds.\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL, an immovable force! pic.twitter.com/XBtM83VX4k\n\nIn the NBA Finals that year, Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers, looking to end the Lakers' historic run, took a shock game-one win courtesy Iverson's iconic performance. However, Shaquille O'Neal and the Lakers eventually proved to be too strong for the 76ers.\n\nShaq produced an incredible 33 points and almost 16 rebounds per game as the Lakers beat the 76ers in five games.\n\nThe 2002 NBA Finals were better for O'Neal from a statistical perspective. However, he averaged 33 points on 57% shooting against a four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year (Dikembe Mutombo), which was indeed a fabulous achievement.\n\nIn the process, O'Neil took home his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award.\n\n#2 Shaquille O'Neal - 2000 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 38.0 PPG | 2.3 APG | 16.7 RPG | 2.7 STL | 61% FG.\n\nWe are not done yet with Shaquille O'Neal and his videogame-like numbers in the NBA Finals.\n\nShaq and Kobe Bryant made their LA Lakers breakthrough in the 2000 NBA Finals against the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers. Miller's ring-less career is often attributed to the fact that the player played in the Michael Jordan era; however, the 2000 NBA Finals provided a different narrative in this regard.\n\nO'Neal averaged the second-highest tally of points per game (38) in NBA Finals history. The big man also shot 61% from the field (not unusual from a legendary big man but definitely not so in the NBA Finals and with such dominance).\n\nO'Neal had won the regular-season MVP award that season. He also took home the NBA Finals MVP honors after the Lakers beat the Indiana Pacers in six games.\n\n#1 Michael Jordan - 1993 NBA Finals MVP\n\nStats: 41.0 PPG | 6.3 APG | 8.5 RPG | 1.7 STL | 50% FG | 40% 3P.\n\nMichael Jordan is the all-time leader with six NBA Finals MVP awards in his career.\n\nAmong his six titles won with the Chicago Bulls, his performance in the 1993 NBA Finals triumph against the Phoenix Suns particularly stands out. That year, Michael Jordan became the first player to win three NBA Finals MVP awards in a row.\n\nThe last 50-point game in the #NBAFinals...Michael Jordan put up 55 for the @ChicagoBulls in Game 4 of the 1993 #NBAFinals! #NBAvault pic.twitter.com/syct1vVdOU\n\nIn sealing the first of the Bulls' two three-peats, Jordan had to find every ounce of energy and ability in his offensive game against the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns, something he did with aplomb.\n\nHe averaged 41 points per game in the series and produced a career-high in the NBA Finals with his tally of 55 points in game four to put the series 3-1 in Chicago's favor.\n\nHis Airness scored 40 or more points in four games in that six-game series, with four of them coming on the trot between games two and five.\n\nJordan also averaged 33 shots per game, shooting with 50% efficiency. He also made 40% of his 25 attempts from the three in that series to deservedly earn the NBA Finals MVP recognition.\n\nMichael Jordan's 1993 NBA Finals performance is arguably the greatest in competition history.\n\nAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: Uncertainty looms over Kevin Love's future with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nVictor R.

Let me just start this article off by simply reminding you all that the greatest basketball player of all time is Michael Jordan, and there is no way else in the running for his undisputed no. 1 spot, especially anyone that is still playing in the NBA currently (just for clarification). With that being said, one of the biggest pieces of Jordan's legacy is the fact he went 6 for 6 in the NBA Finals for a flawless record. 6 championships in 8 seasons (the two seasons he didn't win a title was during his brief retirement), two separate three peats. When looking back at the championships that the Chicago Bulls won, one has to recognize that each time, Jordan won Finals MVP pretty convincingly. With that said, which of his 6 Finals MVP awards is the best? Which is his \"worst\" performance? Let's take a look at Jordan and his Finals performances ranked in order.\n\n6. 1996 NBA Finals(27.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.2 APG, 1.7 SPG, 42% FG, 32% 3PT, 84% FT)The greatest team season in NBA history was capped off with an excellent 15-3 postseason run that saw the Bulls defeat the Seattle Supersonics in 6 games. Heading into the NBA Finals, Jordan was wrecking anything in his way, but the Sonics were an amazing team in their own right, and their defense presented a tough challenge for the Bulls. After the Bulls went up 3-0, the Sonics fought back to take games 4 and 5, before falling short in game 6. Jordan however, struggled in this series at times, with game 3 being his best game of the series overall. While Jordan led the team scoring wise, a lot of credit for closing out the series has to go to Dennis Rodman and his impact on the floor. Jordan was still the best player on the floor during this Finals, but with the Sonics giving him trouble at times, this his least favorable Finals MVP win, mostly due to his inefficiency and small struggles. Still, a win is a win, and the Bulls won their 4th title in 6 seasons.\n\n5. 1997 NBA Finals(32.3 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.0 APG, 46% FG, 32% 3PT, 77% FT)This isn’t the most efficient Finals performance from Jordan, but it was one of his most iconic for what it represents. As the Bulls attempted to go for their 5th title in 7 years, they faced a grave challenge against a hungry and focused Utah Jazz team, who seemed to be just a good as the Bulls. Of the three Finals Jordan played in when he came back from retirement, this is his best work, because the challenge of a Jazz team that went 64-18 with two All Stars in Karl Malone and John Stockton was going to be tough to overcome. Game 1 was close throughout, but Karl Malone missed two free throws to put the Jazz up, and instead, the game would be tied at 82 with a few seconds left. Enter Michael Jordan. He hit a jumper at the buzzer to win the game and put the Bulls up 1-0, and then, his game 2 performance was exactly what the Bulls needed, as he would put up 38 points, 13 rebounds, and 9 assists to give them a 2-0 lead. However, games 3 and 4 didn’t go the way that the Bulls would hope, and they found themselves tied 2-2 heading into game 5. Enter The Flu Game. The story is well known, so there is no need to go on and on about it, but this is the game where Jordan stepped up and took over for the Bulls, amidst an illness (which really seems like food poisoning more so than the flu). He led the Bulls back from a 16 point deficit, and iced the game with a clutch three pointer to put the Bulls up 3-2. In Game 6 in Chicago, the Bulls would play a down to the wire game against the Jazz, with Jordan leading the way with 39 points and 11 rebounds, and a Steve Kerr jumper iced the game and series, as the Bulls won their 5th title in 7 seasons.\n\n4. 1998 NBA Finals\n\n(33.5 PPG, 4.3 RPG, 2.3 APG, 1.8 SPG, 43% FG, 31% 3PT, 82% FT)As amazing as \"The Shot\" is, it doesn’t sum up in total what Jordan did during the series, which is take over with Scottie Pippen hurt through the series and missing time. It’s interesting to note that unlike previous Finals appearances, Jordan wasn’t as active on the boards or making passes. He just wanted to score or defend. For the Bulls, their attempt at a third straight title (for a second time) saw them without home court advantage. The Jazz were out for revenge after last season. For the most part, this seemed to be the perfect storm for the Jazz to win, but it wasn’t meant to be. After the Jazz took game 1, the Bulls fought back to take game 2 on the back of a 37 point performance from Jordan. Game 3 would be one of the greatest defensive team performances ever, as the Bulls won 96-54 and abused the Jazz throughout. However, the Jazz would keep on fighting. After the Bulls won game 4 to take a 3-1 lead, the Jazz fought back to win game 5, and push the series back to Utah for the remaining games. With Pippen hurt during this series, Jordan would have to take on the pressure of pushing his team to a win, and in game 6, no one was better than Michael Jordan. Jordan would drop 45 points, including the infamous shot to win the game and the series for the Bulls. While his efficiency wasn’t as great as prior performances, Jordan still was able to show up when needed and give the Bulls exactly what they needed to defeat the Jazz. The mental and physical wear and tear of 6 Finals in 8 years has to be great, and the fact that Jordan was able to maintain such excellence every year and win every time says a lot. This was the perfect swan song performance for his Chicago tenure.\n\n3. 1992 NBA Finals(35.8 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 6.5 APG, 1.7 SPG, 53% FG, 43% 3PT, 89% FT)It isn't often that a star player can shoot 50/40/90 in the NBA playoffs, let alone the heightened competition of the NBA Finals, but Jordan was THIS close to doing it against an excellent Trailblazers team. Led by Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, this team was one of the best Jordan had faced, and this series is recognized notably for his infamous shrug in game 1 after hitting multiple threes in succession. This series was hard fought, as the Blazers managed to tie it at 1-1 before heading back to Portland, and after Chicago took game 3, the Blazers rose to the challenge and won game 4. With the momentum moving in their favor and game 5 in Portland, the Blazers could have pulled off an upset, but Jordan wasn't having it, putting up a 46 point performance to give the Bulls a clutch victory, alongside an excellent all around game from Scottie Pippen, who finished with 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 9 assists. Game 6 seemed to be going in the favor of the Blazers, but Jordan and Pippen led the team back from a 15 point deficit in the third to take the victory, and their second straight NBA Title. Jordan was amazing in this Finals. It says a lot that this performance is just no. 3 on the list, because for anyone else, this would be no. 1 without question. That's how great Jordan was when it mattered.\n\n2. 1991 NBA Finals\n\n(31.2 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 11.4 APG, 2.8 SPG, 1.4 BPG, 56% FG, 50% 3PT, 85% FT)Picking between his first Finals and the last Finals of his first three-peat is extremely tough. In terms of getting it done, this is probably the best all around performance on the court, but Jordan was hungry, hadn't been Finals battle tested and was out to prove something. The Lakers were a battle tested team, and one of the last dynasties in the NBA on its last legs. For the Bulls, this presented yet another tough challenge due to the Pistons being their opponents in the Eastern Conference Finals. Jordan was magnificent in the Finals, averaging 31 points and 11 assists a game, but his supporting cast was also important, as Pippen would average nearly 21 points and 10 rebounds a game, with Horace Grant giving them 15 points and 8 rebounds. This was their most focused playoff year IMO and a dominant showcase for the Bulls. He was all around the best player easily, and this was the official passing of the torch.\n\n1. 1993 NBA Finals(41.0 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG, 51% FG, 40% 3PT, 70% FT)While not his most efficient performance from the foul line, this is the greatest performance ever in the NBA Finals. No one was asked to do more in the Finals than Jordan was in this series (except 1998 Jordan). For Jordan, in 1993, the Bulls were chasing their third straight title, and they needed to lean on their two best players to overcome not having home court advantage and being the no. 2 seed in the East (sounds familiar for another dynasty this season, just out West), and that they did. While Pippen would average a little over 44 minutes a game, Jordan was given no rest and averaged 46 minutes a game in the Finals. He would carry the scoring load and perform to the best of his ability when called upon, and that's exactly what he did in every game. After giving the Bulls a 2-0 advantage over the Suns, the Suns would fight back in a classic game 3 that went to three overtime periods. After that battle, MJ would rise to the occasion, delivering 55 points in a crucial momentum swing game that put the Bulls up 3-1 and gave them a clear cut advantage going ahead. With the Suns actually shocking everyone and winning in Chicago, the series was 3-2 and headed back to Phoenix. This could have worked in favor of the Suns and in the last minute of the game, it seemed as though it would. The Suns were up 98-94, and the Bulls couldn't get anyone to score except Jordan. After Jordan cut the lead to 98-96, a missed shot by the Suns would lead to one of the most clutch shots in NBA history, as John Paxson hit a big time three to win the game and the NBA Finals. While Paxson and his shot are iconic, none of that would be possible without Jordan and his 4th quarter scoring once the rest of the Bulls went cold. With a record 41.0 PPG in the Finals, along with perhaps his heaviest workload in the Finals on his third straight trip, this is the greatest MJ Finals performance and the greatest NBA Finals performance.\n\n-MH/True\n\n--\n\n--\n\nWritten by DAR Sports Media\n\nHome of DAR Sports Media.
