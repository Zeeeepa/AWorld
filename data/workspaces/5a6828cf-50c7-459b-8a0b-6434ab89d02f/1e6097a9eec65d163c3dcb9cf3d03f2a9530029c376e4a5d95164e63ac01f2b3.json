Personalize SI with our new App. Install on iOS or Android.â\n\nLeBron James has done the impossible, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a massive Finals upset of the 73-win Golden State Warriors.\n\nJames won his third Finals MVP in the series, and deservedly so. James was incredible against the Warriors, posting back-to-back 41-point games when Cleveland was facing elimination, then recording a triple double in an epic Game 7.\n\nJames is now 3â4 in the Finals, with performances ranging from meltdown to miraculous. How does James's 2016 series stack up with the rest of Finals appearances? Weâve ranked all seven of them below:\n\nâ¢Â Get SIâs Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Championship package\n\n7. 2011 Finals\n\nâ17.8 points per game, 7.2 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game\n\nLeBronâs first Finals with the Heat was easily the worst of his career. James struggled against the Mavericks, who flummoxed him with a zone defense and an uncanny ability to keep him out of the paint. The series was catnip for his critics, who could point to LeBronâsÂ fourth-quarter stats as evidence of his inability to perform in the clutch. He was shockingly passive at times in the series, refusing to take J.J. BareaÂ into the post and failing to dominate his matchups defensively. Of course, the series likely set the stage for Jamesâs return to form and was the beginning of his biblical arc in Miami.Â\n\n6. 2007 Finals\n\nâ22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG\n\nA young James was no match for the veteran Spurs in 2007. The Cavaliers were swept, with Gregg PopovichÂ daring LeBron to shoot from the outside for much of the series. With space on the perimeter, James couldnât capitalize with his inconsistent shot. To Cleveland's credit, this series was close over the final couple games. After the sweep, Tim Duncan told LeBron that James would soon be the face of the NBA. Little did Duncan know he and LeBron would still have epic battles to come.\n\n5. 2014 Finals\n\nâ28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG\n\nThe Heat were outclassed by the Spurs in 2014, but by no stretch was LeBron to blame. People may remember the cramps from Game 1, but LeBron was outstanding during this series. He was failed by his teammates, with a limpingÂ Dwyane Wade often barely in the frame on defense and Chris Bosh struggling against San Antonioâs frontcourt. James was extremely efficient against the Spursâ defense, a testament to how much his jumper had improved since his first go-around with PopovichÂ seven years earlier. James shot 57.1% from the field and nearly 52% from three, and the series was ultimately an injustice to his performance.Â\n\nâ¢Â LeBronÂ James: âIâm coming home to Clevelandâ\n\n4. 2013 Finals\n\nâ25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG\n\nThere were so many huge LeBron moments from this series. His emphatic block of Tiago Splitter in Game 2. A Batman-and-Batman game from James and Wade in Game 4. And a clutch jumperâhis MJ momentâto clinch Game 7. But letâs talk about Game 6. People love to say LeBron was saved by Ray Allenâs three pointer. This is a horrible opinion. James was unreal on that unforgettable night. Remember when he lost his headband and seemingly found a new level of power? James left every single thing he had on the floor in that game, posting more than 30 points and a triple double to help save the Heatâs season. This was LeBron at his finest. He was everywhere on the court defensively. He anchored lineups in which he was surrounded by four shooters, lifting Miami to new heights offensively. He did everything and more that had been asked of him, and James is more responsible than Allen when it comes to protecting his legacy.\n\nOh, and James was equally special in the closeout, scoring 37 to seal the deal on his second straight championship.\n\nLeBron James Off the Court\n\nAnd so it begins....\n\nLebron went with a stuffed elephant over a basketball for this portrait.\n\nA high-school aged LeBron poses during a Field of Dreams-inspired photo shoot in 2002.\n\nJames didn't always boast a 250-pound frame, but has always been an intimidating presence, having averaged 21 points per game as a freshman in high school.\n\nSt. Vincent-St. Mary games were often broadcast on national television and played in college arenas during James' time with the Irish. He never did play in a college game, though.\n\nDespite all the fanfare and attention surrounding James in his high school years, the kid destined for stardom stayed hungry.\n\nLeBron got to meet Michael Jordan while His Airness was still playing. Jordan had just finished playing against the Cavaliers in this 2003 picture.\n\nLeBron's younger brother, Frankie, accompanies LeBron at the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nBecause what else would James watch in his leisure time?\n\nDon't we all wish we could be teenage superstars with a limo stocked with Tootsie Pops.\n\nLeBron goes all \"Cat in the Hat\" while speaking to kids at a Cavaliers Read to Achieve event in 2003.\n\nLeBron shows off his pearly whites during an NBA photo shoot in 2003.\n\nLeBron celebrates his 21st birthday by sharing the mic with rapper Lil' Wayne.\n\nJames' kid-friendly image has been shaped by his life as a father. He has three children with his high school sweetheart Savannah Brinson â LeBron Jr., Bryce Maximus, and Zhuri.\n\nLeBron James: MVP, All-Star, scoring champ and ... MC Hammer look-alike at the 2007 ESPYs.\n\nFans and experts alike wonder how good LeBron could have been as a pro football player, given his size and strength. He was an All-State wide receiver in high school, and even Packers president Mark Murphy has compared his skills to Jerry Rice's.\n\nAnd if he decides to pull a Michael Jordan and try a career in baseball, it looks like LeBron may have a bright future in that, as well.\n\nJames, decked out in warm-ups of his high school alma mater, enjoys a chuckle with Jay-Z during the 2010 All-Star Weekend in Dallas.\n\nLeBron entered the 2010 offseason as the most sought-after free agent on the market. After contemplating a future in New York, New Jersey, Chicago, Miami or a return to Cleveland, James chose to take his talents to South Beach where he could play with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nRegardless of the ill will, James still makes time for his fans. In this photo, The King plays Connect Four with children from the Miami Rescue Mission in 2010.\n\nLeBron joins 200 youth in a spontaneous \"chalk clap\" to dedicate a new athletic field at the Boys & Girls Club of Central Florida in 2010.\n\nJames joins Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade at a Miami performing arts center to celebrate Bosh's 28th birthday in March 2012.

Smith looks on before Ohio State's game against Michigan at the Horseshoe in 2016.\n\n3. 2012 Finals\n\nâ28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG\n\nJames completed his transformation from villain to heroâa feeling only he and Ye knowâwith a dominant series in the 2012 Finals. This was the only Finals of LeBronâs career in which it felt like he had a direct rival: Kevin Durant. James took the challenge. He outplayed his counterpart offensively and defended Durant during the gameâs key moments. James exhibited a hunger in this series that could only emerge after years of heartbreak. There was a memorable moment in the fifth and final game of the series when LeBronÂ grabbed a rebound over three defenders, missed a shot, got his own rebound, then made a layup while being fouled. The play was a perfect example of Jamesâs physical dominance and refusal to be contained. With a triple double in the closeout game, James ensured his legacy would be one of a championship winner.Â\n\nâ¢ LeBron wins Finals MVP | Best highlights from Game 7\n\n2. 2015 Finals\n\nâ35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG\n\nIn an underdog role without his best teammate, Kyrie Irving, James put the Cavaliers on his back in the 2015 Finals. His efficiency dropped as his counting stats rose, but James single-handedly managed to slow down the team that had been running roughshod through the NBA. Jamesâs performance wasnât enough to lead his team to a win, but it should have been worthy of the Finals MVP award. James slowed the game down against Golden State in 2015, often pounding the ball before going 1-on-5 at the end of the shot clock. Even when everyone in the world knew what was coming, James managed to pour in buckets while scrambling all over the place on defense. The look of exhaustion on Jamesâs face by the end of the series was more than well earned.Â\n\n1. 2016 Finals\n\n29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG\n\nAfter two years of Stephen Curry hype, James reclaimed his status as the best player in the NBA with an incredible Finals performance. Curry had earned all the accolades usually reserved for James during the regular season, as he was crowned (by many) the leagueâs best player and earned the NBAâs first unanimous MVP selection. But James thoroughly outplayed Curry for most of the Finals, and personally reminded Curry who the NBAâs top dog was with a degrading swatâand hilarious smirkâduring Game 6. LeBron went up against all odds in this seriesâdown 3â1 entering Game 5, going against the winningest regular season team in NBA historyâbut showed that he himself could serve as an equalizer in the face of so many narratives. Jamesâs back-to-back 40-point explosions in Games 5 and 6 sent a message to every single fan of the NBA: When LeBron James is locked in, thereâs no one capable of stopping him.Â\n\nRohan Nadkarni covers the NBA for SI.com.

        "raw_content": "The King Becomes a Legend\n\nLeBron James was already one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Now his record is unimpeachable.\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nLeBron James was anointed as a transcendent, generational star while he was still in high school. He’s been the best player in basketball for most of the 13 years he’s been in the league—a four-time MVP, a 12-time All-Star, and already the 11th-leading scorer in NBA history by the age of 31. He’s the most physically gifted player of all time, faster and more skilled than anyone with his size and strength. And yet on Sunday night, a few minutes after he led the Cleveland Cavaliers to their first-ever title, James said, “I don’t know why the man above give me the hardest road.” The now three-time NBA champ spoke the truth.\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals felt like a rock fight staged inside an enormous pothole. Steph Curry, the unanimous MVP, shot 6 for 19 from the field and finished with more turnovers than assists. His fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson shot 6 for 17 from the floor and 2–10 from 3-point range. LeBron himself shot just 9 for 24 and led both teams with five turnovers. After he scored six straight points to put the Cavs up 89–87 with 4:52 to go, James missed four shots in a row, each of which would’ve given Cleveland back the lead. On the other end, the Warriors missed their last nine shot attempts. The only player on either team who made a field goal in the last 4:39 was Kyrie Irving, whose 3-pointer with 53 seconds left turned out to be the game-winner in Cleveland’s 93–89 victory over Golden State.\n\nThis is the thing about the NBA and legacies and greatness: In this series, LeBron was about as dominant as any basketball player can be, and he never came close to controlling his team’s fate. If one of the best offensive teams in history managed to score any points at all in the last few minutes of the fourth quarter … if Curry didn’t throw a dumb behind-the-back pass out of bounds … if Kyrie Irving had clanged that long jumper instead of knocking it in, then this story probably wouldn’t include the phrase “three-time NBA champ.”\n\nJames led both teams in the NBA Finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. He scored 41 points in Game 5, 41 more in Game 6, and put up a triple-double in Game 7. With a little less than two minutes on the clock, he chased down Andre Iguodala and made the block of the century to keep the game tied.\n\nA couple of minutes later, he nearly destroyed space and time with a game-clinching dunk over Draymond Green. That would’ve been fitting, for the best player in the world to seal one of the most significant victories in NBA history with one of the greatest dunks ever.\n\nBut Green fouled him, hard, sending James to the line. He flicked his jammed right wrist and made one out of two free throws, giving the Cavs the two-possession lead they wouldn’t relinquish. This was less spectacular but somehow more appropriate. LeBron soared over everyone, got knocked out of the sky, and had to pull himself off the ground to lock up his franchise’s biggest victory.\n\nBut to bring a championship to Cleveland, the best player in the game needed a couple of breaks. This is the reality of professional sports, and it’s because of that reality that I’ve rooted for LeBron James for the past 10 years. Players play to win championships, and fans and writers evaluate them based on whether they succeed. It’s unfair, but it’s what makes the games we watch so thrilling. Since winner-takes-some is never going to be a thing, those of us who want one of the best players we’ve ever seen to get the respect he deserves have no choice but to hope he gets the bounces he needs to make his résumé unimpeachable.\n\nLeBron led the first-ever comeback from 3–1 down in the NBA Finals. He beat the greatest regular-season team ever. He came back to his home state of Ohio and won a championship for the most star-crossed sports city in the United States. That block on Iguodala isn’t the block that kept the game tied before Steph Curry went off and won his second title in a row. It’s the Block. If he wasn’t before, LeBron James is now, rightfully, a basketball legend.\n\nIt’s been a hard road for LeBron James. It was a hard road to get nicknamed “the Chosen One” as a high school junior, then get criticized even as he exceeded every unrealistic expectation. It was a hard road to get drafted by his home-state team, and be expected to do what no other player in any sport had done for Cleveland since 1964. It was a hard road to leave Ohio for another, better opportunity, and to have his jersey burned by the fans that had claimed to love him. It was a hard road to come back, to forgive Dan “Comic Sans” Gilbert, and to say he was “ready to accept the challenge” of winning a championship with the Cavaliers. It was a hard road to play without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving in last year’s finals. It was a hard road at times to play with Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving—the star power forward who can’t play defense and the star point guard who sees the game as a 48-minute one-man show with occasional intermissions during which other people are allowed to touch the ball. It was a hard road to lead a team that might not have even made the postseason without him.\n\nWinning a championship in any sport is hard. An NBA championship is harder to win than most. There are no hot goaltenders or dominant starting pitchers. The playoffs aren’t a crapshoot; they’re a gauntlet. You can’t luck your way to an NBA title. You can’t hoist the trophy by relying on grit and guile. You have to be the best, or very, very close to the best, and hope that this is one of the years in which that’s good enough.\n\nIn his 2014 “coming home” essay in Sports Illustrated, James told Lee Jenkins, “In Northeast Ohio, nothing is given. Everything is earned. You work for what you have.” LeBron did more than enough to earn this championship, by playing as well as a basketball player can and by making his teammates better. Doing enough to win a title doesn’t always mean you win one, especially when you’re playing against Steph Curry and the Warriors. Nothing was given to LeBron James. But now he has this championship, and nobody will ever be able to take it away.\n\nAbout\n\nSubscriptions\n\nAdvertising\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nFollow Us\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.
