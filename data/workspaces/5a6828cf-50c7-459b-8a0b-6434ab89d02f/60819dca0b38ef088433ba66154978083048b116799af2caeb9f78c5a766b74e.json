However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.
