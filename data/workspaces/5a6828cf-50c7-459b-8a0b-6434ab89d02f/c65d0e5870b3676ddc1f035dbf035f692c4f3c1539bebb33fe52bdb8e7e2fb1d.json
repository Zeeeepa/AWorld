However, by the 2022-23 season, we see a more even distribution of three-point attempts across positions, with centers and power forwards contributing more from beyond the arc. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shift suggests that the NBA is moving toward a model where \"shooting bigs\" are becoming more common, while point guards are not necessarily relied upon as primary three-point shooters.\n\n3-Pointers by Team\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nThis graph showcases the distribution of 3-point attempts by each team for the Center (C), Power Forward (PF), and Point Guard (PG) positions.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEach NBA team has clearly shifted in the distribution of shot attempts for these positions. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome teams, like the Atlanta Hawks, likely experimented with \"shooting bigs\" in the 2015-16 season but resorted back to traditional shooting in the 2022-23 season.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis shows that although there are overall swings with the NBA, some teams may still opt for the traditional route. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBut, as Hawks fans are well aware, this has not led to championship success.\n\nStatistical Increases: The Modern NBA’s Offensive Explosion\n\nAcross all three seasons, there has been a noticeable increase in points, assists, and rebounds, with three-pointers seeing the most significant rise. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis trend underscores the growing emphasis on the three-point shot as a primary offensive weapon. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe increase in these statistics is a testament to the evolution of the game, where teams are not only scoring more but also relying heavily on the three-point line to do so.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nComparing Generational Talents: Jordan, Curry, Jokic, and Green\n\nThe Future of the NBA: What’s Next?\n\n"

ABSTRACT This article aimed to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan by studying his technical actions, shots, and relationship with teammates. The study focused on the six games of the 1995-1996 NBA playoff finals, utilizing an ad hoc instrument with 14 dimensions and 147 categories. The data underwent synchronous analysis to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria. The results indicated by this data revealed the percentage of Jordan's involvement and his manner of participation. Additionally, a diachronic analysis was conducted using polar coordinate analysis to measure associative consistency among different behaviours. This allowed for the observation and analysis of Jordan's relationship with teammates. The obtained data highlights the significance of dribbling, free throws and fadeaway shot as frequent and effective technical actions used by Jordan. Moreover, they illustrate how Michael was a prominent player in the game, actively contributing to the offensive actions of his team.

Kinetic Performance, S. L. INTRODUCTION Basketball is one of the most practiced sports in the world (Quispe, 2023) and research has traditionally focused on aspects such as training, biomechanics, health and injuries, and physiology (Amirnordin et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Shi & Wu, 2024). However, technical-tactical studies, carried out from systematic observation, have not been sufficiently developed (Remmert, 2003) to date. Nevertheless, the emergence of increasingly sophisticated data analysis software, combined with the development of rigorous methodological approaches, provided researchers the tools to prove or disprove numerous theories about basketball that, until then, lacked scientific credibility. A particularly prominent area of the current research in the field of basketball is the relationship between physiological demands and the technical-tactical performance that players develop (Figueira et al, 2022). The depth and sophistication of these interactions, directly related to creativity and intra-team coordination (Furley & Memmert, 2015), confirm that basketball, along with its underlying structures, is a complex system (Klostermann et al., 2018). This complexity of the game generates complex data when studied, which, if simplified and decomposed into measurable units, becomes easier to analyse (Bakeman & Quera, 1996). In the case of basketball, this \"simplification\" is the only way to validate associations and/or causal relationships that occur during the game and obtain behavioural structures and interactions between them, from a certain distance, that does not affect their development. In this complex game, the whole, which means the team, is more than the sum of its parts, hence the importance of understanding how different players interact and relate to each other. One of the main data analysis techniques to analyse complex interactions in sports is polar coordinate analysis applied to data collected through systematic observation (Anguera & Hernández-Mendo, 2015; Castañer et al., 2016, 2017). Polar coordinate analysis can be used to measure the spontaneous behaviour of players interacting in their natural environment from the perspective of a specific behaviour, known as focal behaviour, having been performed with a high degree of success in other team sports such as soccer (Maneiro & Amatria, 2018) or handball (Navarro et al, 2018). In this sense, this typology of analysis has proven to be an effective tool to decompose the complexity of the game (Lago & Anguera, 2002; Castellano & Hernández-Mendo, 2003; Perea et al., 2012; Robles et al., 2013). Its application to the study of several of the best athletes in the world from various collective sports disciplines (Castañer et al., 2016; Castañer et al., 2017; Maneiro and Amatria, 2018) has allowed researchers to obtain practical conclusions about what makes these players excellent and, in return, make recommendations to improve the offensive and defensive aspects of the game. However, polar coordinate analysis has not yet been tested in players with a specific demarcation such as shooting guards. Most of the research on shooting guards is based on different groups of players based on their position in the field between this specific demarcation and point guards, obtaining interconnected results, which in no case can be confirmed as definitive for this type of demarcation, that is, the data analysed is generally outside the specific context of the actions and tactical technical performance developed by these players (Gómez et al, 2007; Sampaio et al., 2008). On the other hand, the relationships that occur between players are usually viewed through a prism focused on their traditional role according to their position on the field. However, in today's basketball, where greater versatility is increasingly required from players, only three key positions (guard, forward and centre) are identified, according to Sampaio et al. (2006), leaving the shooting guard position diluted and integrated in a non-specific way as such. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 109 This happens since the traditional mission of the shooting guard is characterized by their permeability, being a driving force that helps the point guards to organize the game and raise the ball, as well as having mastered shots at all distances (outside, inside and free throws), an aspect that conditions him to be the team's highest scorer and the player with the greatest responsibility attacking. This is why his identification as such is not defined, since he shares the functions of point guard and small forward. In this sense, Fransen et al. (2016), in their study on leadership in sport, determine that the players with main rolls in the game are in a very beneficial spatial position that, in combination with their high tactical responsibilities, positions them as team leaders. Following this line, there are many current examples of great international players that play this position such as Stephen Curry, Luca Doncic or James Hardem, who have as role models players like Kobe Bryant, who had at the same time Michael Jordan as an idol to emulate, latter considered the best shooting guard of all time (Greer, 2023). Given the above, it is considered appropriate to carry out an in-depth analysis of one of the best shooting guards of all time in his natural environment. This will be carried out through the study of his interactions between teammates and his executed technique, aiming to unequivocally and scientifically establish the elements that must be present in players who play or wish to play in this position that is so relevant in basketball. Applying a robust methodological approach, combined with in-depth multidimensional analysis of rigorously coded data, will help provide objective insights into how Michael Jordan interacts with his environment and makes him unique. The specific objective is to analyse Michael Jordan's technical skills in the NBA playoff final of the 1995-1996 season through his technical actions, his shoots and his relationship with his teammates. METHOD To carry out the development of the present research, the Observational Methodology (Anguera, 1979) has been applied. The research design, in accordance with Sánchez-Algarra and Anguera (2013), follows an Idiographic model –given that a single team is the unit of study–, a Tracking model –studying during the games that constitute the finals of the 1995-1996 playoffs–, and a Multidimensional model –due to the categories that form the dimensions constituting the observation instrument. The conducted observation has been guided by scientific criteria with total perceptiveness and as a non-participating observer. Participants/Sample The observational sampling conducted has been intentional (Anguera, et al., 2011) with the American professional basketball team Chicago Bulls during the development of the playoff finals for the NBA Champion title in the 1995-1996 season (in this season, the Chicago Bulls won 72 games, breaking the all-time record for most victories in a season, a record that lasted for 20 years). The videos used are publicly available television broadcasts that have been retrieved for the study. All offensive sequences developed by the team during the 6 games that make up the finals of that season –1995-1996– have been coded. The 521 coded offensive sequences consist of 4798 multi-events. Intersessional consistency has been ensured through the following elements: the same ball size, the same court dimensions, the same game time, the same players on the roster, and the same jersey assignments. Observation instrument The present research required the development of an ad hoc observation instrument –see Table 1– which drew from the following sources: the works of Alsasua et al. (2018) and Arroyo et al. (2022). The instrument adapted their contributions and included new dimensions –Player Position, Defensive System, and Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 110 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. Consequence– which will provide a solid foundation for addressing the research objective. The instrument is a combination of nested category systems in field formats –dimensions. These categories adhere to the premise of being exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Table 1.

Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 111 Recording and coding The data was recorded (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2014) using Lince software, version 1.2.1 (Gabin et al., 2012), achieving an intra-observer agreement value of .91. The obtained data is of type IV, i.e., concurrent and time-based (Anguera et al., 2011). Subsequently, two additional programs were employed. The first one was Gseq v5.1 (Bakeman & Quera, 2011), through which sequential analysis of delays was conducted. Later, the program Hoisan, version 1.2 (Hernández-Mendo et al., 2012), was utilized. The data obtained from the previous software was entered and analysed for obtaining polar coordinates. Finally, for the representation of results, the ObserTools application (Rodríguez-Medina et al., 2021) was employed. Data quality The data collection was carried out by two graduates in Sports Science with extensive experience in the studied sport and the use of observational methodology. However, the observers received specific training for data collection in this study following the phases recommended by Anguera (2003). The primary observer recorded all sequences comprising the observational sampling, while the second observer recorded 16.7% of the total sample. The reliability of the obtained data was calculated using Cohen's (1960) Kappa coefficient. This coefficient measures the agreement between nominal classifications where there is no order of ranking. GSEQ software version 5.1 was used for the calculation of this coefficient following the recommendations established by Bakeman & Quera (2011). The concordance index achieved by the primary observer was .91 (intra-observer agreement). Regarding the result of inter-observer agreement, it was higher than .86 in all games included in the study (game 1 = .93; game 2 = .87; game 3 = .94; game 5 = .88, game 6 = .87). Considering these concordance data, it can be stated that the agreement is almost perfect (Landis & Koch, 1977). Data analysis Two types of data analysis have been employed to address the stated objectives: synchronous analysis and diachronic analysis. Synchronous analysis through inferential statistics has been used to assess the relationship between variables and various success criteria, using the Pearson chi-square statistic (χ²). This was done by applying the following formula: χ2 = ∑ [(𝐹 𝑖𝑗−𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗)2 𝐹 ̂𝑖𝑗 ] 𝑘 𝑖,𝑗=1 The computation of this statistic was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0. Regarding the diachronic analysis, polar coordinates analysis has been employed, which is a very recent typology of analysis in sports science (Anguera and Hernández-Mendo, 2015). Cochran's Zsum (1954) is the foundation and origin of this analysis technique, which applies and is based on the principle that the sum of N independent z scores is normally distributed, with Z = 0 and s = N. Thus, the statistic 𝑍sum = ∑ 𝑧 √𝑛 𝑚 𝑙 (where n is the number of delays), according to Sackett (1980), allows measuring the strength or associative consistency between different behaviours. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal 112 | 2024 | ISSUE 2 | VOLUME 2 © 2024 Kinetic Editorial. Kinetic Performance, S. L. The polar coordinates technique, developed by Sackett (1980) and later refined by Anguera (1997), is utilized to identify the relationships between behaviours. The technique involves one of these behaviours: the conditioning behaviour or focal behaviour and the remaining behaviours, which constitute the various dimensions of the observation instrument (conditioned behaviours). This analysis is performed both prospectively (+1 to +5) and retrospectively (-1 to -5), resulting in a vector for each behaviour related to the focal behaviour, with a specific angle and radius. Based on the angle obtained by the vector, it can occupy one of the four quadrants or sectors that make up the polar coordinate. Depending on the quadrant the vector occupies, the activation or inhibition relationship between behaviours varies. In quadrant I, the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. In quadrant II, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the retrospective plane, while it is not in the prospective plane. In quadrant III, the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour in both the prospective and retrospective planes. Lastly, in quadrant IV, the focal behaviour is activated by the mating behaviour in the prospective plane, while it is not in the retrospective plane. RESULTS During Jordan's participation in the 6 games that make up the sample, he interacts with the ball a total of 536 times out of the team's total of 2996 interventions, accounting for 17.89% of the actions in the offensive play where the ball goes through his hands. Regarding the technical actions executed by Michael Jordan, the obtained results indicate the presence of significant differences (χ² = 163006; p < .001). Standout actions include dribbling –Drib– with 35.9%, Free-throw shooting –Lan– (11.9%), and Dribble –Bot– (12.6%), percentages superior in all cases to the results achieved by his teammates. On the other hand, RP –reception and pass– and Pas –pass– actions present lower percentage results compared to the rest of the teammates with 34.0% and 2.7%, respectively (Table 2). Table 2.

Notably, the actions of TEs –Static Shot– (31.9%) and TAtR –Backward Jump Shot– with 15.9% stand out in this regard. Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 113 Effectiveness Regarding shooting effectiveness, i.e., the success of making or missing the shooting action, the results obtained, when comparing the performances of Michael Jordan with the rest of his teammates, show significant differences (χ² = 1615, p < .001) in favour of Michael Jordan, presenting much higher shooting efficiency percentages than the rest of his teammates –Table 4. Table 4. Shooting effectiveness. Ineffective Effective Other players 54.1% 45.9% Michael Jordan 48.8% 51.2% There are no significant differences in Jordan's involvement and the moment of the game, nor between the moment and the effectiveness of the shot, nor between the moment and the effectiveness between games. Finally, the results obtained are presented regarding the associative analysis through the use of polar coordinates technique, where Michael Jordan is related to the rest of the players in the squad who participated in the different games played. For the development of this analysis, the focal behaviour J23 has been related to the rest of the categories that make up the dimension (J33, J91, J13, J07, J09, J25, J34, J08, J22, J30, J00, J53, and J35), as well as with itself (J23). This analysis aims to verify the relationship established between Michael Jordan and the rest of the teammates throughout the final phase. The results obtained (Table 5 and Figure 1) show the criterion category J23 (Michael Jordan) with a radius of 7.24 and an angle of 45 degrees in quadrant I, where the focal behaviour activates the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes. Also, the categories J25 (Steve Kerr), J22 (John Salley), J00 (Randy Brown), J34 (Bill Wennington), and J30 (Jud Buechler) are observed with radii of 5.96, 3.69, 3.02, 3.33, and 2.96, and angles of 223.63°, 230.61°, 259.26°, 226.63°, and 238.32° respectively, in quadrant III, where the focal behaviour inhibits the presence of the mating behaviour both in the prospective and retrospective planes.

DISCUSSION Following Anguera and Hernández-Mendo (2015), the effectiveness of observational methodology lies in its ability to conduct a diachronic analysis with type II and type IV data, meaning data that include an order and a time component. However, conventional synchronic statistical analyses are also relevant, seeking associations between dimensions that provide categorical data to meet the objectives established in match analysis (O’Donoghue, 2009). Regarding the technical actions performed by Michael Jordan, dribbling stands out as the most prominent. This technical action is characteristic of shooting guards, who, unlike point guards, not only have offensive construction responsibilities, but also play a role in breaking the repetitive dynamics of the attack and are players with a high degree of technical proficiency (Okazaki et al., 2004; De Rose et al., 2004; Gómez et al., 2007). Regarding his shooting performance, Jordan demonstrates a particular expertise in free throw shooting, with a very high success rate. In this regard, this proficiency, coupled with his publicly acknowledged dedication to practicing this technique after daily training sessions, is closely linked to dribbling, as through these one-on-one situations, he manages to draw personal fouls in his favour, and these situations end up leading to free throw attempts, proving to be a decisive performance factor in basketball (Csataljay et al., 2009; Paulauskas et al., 2018). On the other hand, concerning the type of shot Jordan executes most notable, it is the fadeaway. This shooting style became his signature move, not only due to its repetition as the team's offensive finish but also because of his accuracy in scoring. This shooting technique serves as a counterpoint to the previously mentioned dribbling technique. Jordan uses dribbling as a deceptive move or feint to create optimal space, combined with the slight distance gained from the defender when jumping backward, allowing for a higher likelihood of successful execution (Courel-Ibañez et al., 2017). Cook Vaquero, et al. / Technical & relational analysis of Michael Jordan Sustainability and Sports Science Journal VOLUME 2 | ISSUE 2 | 2024 | 115 In this regard, considering Jordan's shooting efficiency during the finals, especially if we take into account the volume and relevance of his shots, it can be observed the significance of this player in the team's scoring success. The precision in field goals is a crucial factor in achieving success in a game, as these variables represent both individual and collective offensive effectiveness (García et al., 2013; Malarranha et al., 2013). Undoubtedly, professional basketball has undergone significant development and evolution in the game over the last decade, showcasing players with increasingly versatile profiles (Courel-Ibáñez et al., 2017; Mateus et al., 2015). Therefore, it is essential to update knowledge about performance profiles in young players with professional potential and assess their suitability for today's high-level basketball (Ibáñez et al., 2018). However, it is crucial not to overlook the qualities and capabilities of players who have left their mark on the history of international basketball, particularly in the NBA, where players often exhibit a higher degree of specialization in their game compared to other competitions (Paulauskas et al., 2018). CONCLUSIONS The objective set in this research was to analyse the technical skills of Michael Jordan in the NBA 1995-1996 playoff finals through his technical actions, shooting, and his relationship with his teammates. To address this objective, two types of analyses, synchronous and diachronic, have been employed, through which, based on the results obtained, the following conclusions can be reached: - Regarding his actions, dribbling stands out, as well as the execution of free throws, which are strongly related elements. Here, Jordan demonstrates excellent ball control and 1x1 skills, forcing defences to engage with more than one opponent and causing defensive personal fouls. - The type of shot he performs that stands out is the fadeaway, a shooting action strongly linked to 1x1 situations. This provides a wide variety of resources and solutions to different 1x1 and even 1x2 scenarios for this player, making defending him a very complex situation due to the unpredictability of his actions. - Jordan is a completely consistent player with effectiveness indices in his actions and a level of participation that remains constant during all four quarters of each game and throughout the six games that make up the NBA finals. - The relationship between Jordan and his teammates does not show significant results exclusively with himself. This is interpreted as a player with great adaptability who both includes his teammates and is included by them in the plays, and the results clearly identify the team as rotation or non-participative. These types of studies allow us to advance and better understand the game of one of the best basketball players in the world. This enables the replication of his actions and a deeper comprehension and appreciation of the evolution of this sport. Similarly, this study serves as guidance for coaches and players in developmental categories, where the specificity of the position is less emphasized, and a more versatile player profile is increasingly valued, capable of effectively participating in the entire development of offensive actions.

Consider one such debate: who is the NBA’s greatest of all time (henceforth referred to as the GOAT)? While social isolation has stripped NBA fans of a thrilling regular season finish and leaves large what-ifs surrounding what would certainly have been the most compelling postseason in the better part of 10 years, it has amply fanned the flames of the old GOAT argument. With no new basketball to consume, I, like many fans, have allowed myself to be consumed by discussing the GOAT across various social media platforms, on FaceTime calls with siblings, or even in appropriately socially distanced activities.\n\nMany of these discussions have come about as a consequence of the riveting docu-series “The Last Dance” (focusing on the Chicago Bulls of the 1980s and ‘90s). Surely no NBA fan can watch the drama of these Bulls teams without being drawn into the GOAT conversation by their singular star, Michael Jeffrey Jordan. No discussion of the GOAT can be taken seriously without the consideration of Michael Jordan, the legendary shooting guard for the Chicago Bulls. Frankly, the GOAT debate begins and ends here for a large portion of NBA fans, and for good reason. Michael Jordan’s individual and team accomplishments literally fill books, and those accolades do not account for his cultural impact on basketball in the US and across the globe. Furthermore, his appeal and impact on a global level fail to do justice to the intensity of his individual preparation and competitive drive which inspired and elevated a generation of NBA All-Stars that followed in his footsteps.\n\nDespite all this, GOAT cases are made (legitimately) for players that came before and after Michael Jordan. Indeed, if the question was easily settled, there would be no debate. And yet, the debate rages on, with varying levels of rhetorical and analytical rigor but with all the fevered passion of a contest that has come down to the wire. The purpose of this report is to approach the GOAT conversation in a data-reinforced manner. I look beyond traditional box score metrics to quantify Michael Jordan’s case for the GOAT, though my own analytical biases will inevitably arise.\n\nData\n\nIn order to make the case for Michael Jordan as the NBA’s GOAT, beginning with a suitable data set is critical. In the case of MJ, I did not find it sensible to compare him to every NBA player that has ever played because (no disrespect) he would simply outshine most of them to an enormous extent. Moreover, the field of potential GOAT candidates has been whittled down over time to a relative handful of players (48 in the case of my data set) by people who form the NBA’s All-Decade teams. These teams are comprised of the greatest players in the 1980, ’90s, and so on until present. I considered only the All-Decade teams from the 1980s until the 2010s because 1) data and advanced statistics for previous players were inconsistently available, 2) the introduction of the 3-point line in 1979 skews scoring statistics from before this time period, and 3) Michael Jordan either played against or inspired the players on this list (often both).\n\nIn terms of the data set’s composition, I chose to shy away from traditional box score or “counting” statistics (points, rebounds, assists, etc.) in favor of more “advanced” metrics. One of the issues with sports data is high levels of correlation between variables. For example, a player who scores a lot of points may also rebound a lot and have a high number of assists, all because they happen to be on the court for a large portion of the game. Having high correlation between your variables is like listening to a song with two guitarists: you may like the sound overall, but it is hard to tell which of the two guitarist is making “more” of the sound you like. Similarly, if we are trying to measure the impact of one variable or another, if they are highly correlated, we may not be able to tell which variable is the most impactful, which can lead to unreliable results when attempting to analyze the data.\n\nPart of the solution to this problem is to use advanced metrics, which are designed to combine and adjust more traditional measures to create measures that take some of the correlation problems out of a data set and also give more insight into a player’s impact on the game. Some of the advanced metrics included in this data set are described below (mostly paraphrased from basketball-reference.com’s excellent glossary):\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating — a combination of various counting statistics that essentially counts a player’s positive and negative statistical contributions, adjusts them for the pace of the game, and compares each individual to the league average in order to determine efficiency.\n\nUsage Rate — an estimate of the percentage of team’s plays that an individual player used.\n\nBox Plus/Minus — an estimate of how many points a player contributed above a league-average player on a league average team. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nWin Shares — an estimate that assigns a “share” of each team win to each player based on that player’s contribution to the win. Can be broken down to offensive and defensive components.\n\nTrue Shooting Percentage — a measure of shooting efficiency based on shot type.\n\nFree Throw and Three Point Rates — these rates are measures of offensive efficiency, measuring and-1 free throws and the proportion of field goal attempts from three-point range.\n\nInitial Visualizations and Observations\n\nTo begin analyzing the data, I decided to take a look at plots that detail some of the attributes that make a player truly great. The first of these is a scatter plot comparing usage and efficiency, color coded by decade and sized by win shares. Why might usage and efficiency be an interesting comparison? Well, because there is generally a trade off between the two. Typically, a player that is used more is less efficient (think more turnovers, more missed shots, etc.). Conversely, a highly efficient player may appear more efficient because they are not used at a high rate. With that trade off scenario in mind, take a look at the following plot, comparing the usage and efficiency of the All-Decade teams:\n\nA few things stand out. First, with these GOAT candidates, there is hardly any evidence of a trade off between usage and efficiency. If anything, there is a positive correlation, meaning higher usage is related to higher efficiency. I take this as evidence of the greatness of all these players. Second, there is a noticeable difference in the distribution of players in some decades: those in the 1980s tended to be more in the lower left corner up through the center of the plot, while players in the 2010s seem to drift from center up toward the upper right corner. While there are several interpretations for this, I tend to think the emphasis on making the game “more” efficient in recent years can explain this trend. Despite that trend, however, the final point is the most striking to me: Michael Jordan is the most highly used and the most efficient of all the players in the data set and he has among the highest win shares to boot. If you were looking for one player that you could use again and again and again and still get efficient results at a historical level, look no further than MJ.\n\nThe next two charts are somewhat similar in that they look at a player’s impact on the defensive and offensive aspects of the game. I took win shares per 48 minutes and box plus/minus, broke them down into their offensive and defensive components, and plotted the players to show what end of the floor each player impacted the most.\n\nHere, the results match intuition to a large degree. Perennial defensive stalwarts like Hakeem Olajuwon and Patrick Ewing are firmly in the high defense, low offense corner of the graphs, whereas prolific offensive players like Adrian Dantley and Steve Nash drift out more toward the high offense and low defense corner. Who occupies the coveted high offense, high defense corner, you ask? Who else? While David Robinson and LeBron James both edge into the realm, Jordan represents the pinnacle of a player who impacts the game at an elite level on both ends of the floor. Combine this with his best-in-class efficiency and usage rates, and his case for the GOAT solidifies.\n\nFactor Analysis — Drawing the GOAT with math\n\nDespite the evidence presented above, it is important to remember that those comparisons of usage versus efficiency and offensive versus defensive prowess are ones that I came up with, and therefore, they reflect my biases about what the GOAT should look like. Instead, factor analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) allows us the opportunity to mathematically determine a few “factors” (combinations of variables) that best describe the data set. In other words, factor analysis can be a way to check if our intuition about what factors are important in determining who the GOAT is. Running a factor analysis on this data set, we have the following three factors:\n\nThere are a few important things to break down here. First, the way to read the three factor columns is to look for the largest numbers in each column and see which variables they correspond with. Doing this, we might say that factor 1 emphasizes the importance of offensive efficiency, while factor 2 emphasizes defense, and factor 3 emphasizes usage. This reading of the factors somewhat reinforces my intuition of what attributes are important in determining the GOAT.\n\nSecond, the little red box at the bottom of the table indicates how much of the variation in the data set can be explained by the three factors above, about 65%. That means there is still about 35% of the differences between these players that cannot be explained by the data included in these factors. That is not surprising, and it is certainly a good reminder that these comparisons I shared should be taken with a grain of salt. However, there is at least some evidence that looking for an elite two-way player with high usage and high efficiency will get you on a suitable path for determining the GOAT.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile these numbers and charts will do nothing to settle the debate over the GOAT once and for all, they certainly provide strong evidence for Michael Jordan. He occupies a nearly untouchable statistical echelon in terms of being a highly used and highly efficient player who dominates on both ends of the floor, even when compared to the best players from the last 40 years of NBA basketball. Doubtless, there are many ways to slice and dice this debate, but if anything, these findings make clear that any other competitor for GOAT is playing on MJ’s home court, and it’s his ball.\n\n--\n\n--\n\nPublished in The Sports Scientist\n\nIn depth view of the world of Sports through the lens of Data Science, and Analytics\n\nWritten by Trevor Ram\n\nWriting about things I want to write about\n\nNo responses yet\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"
