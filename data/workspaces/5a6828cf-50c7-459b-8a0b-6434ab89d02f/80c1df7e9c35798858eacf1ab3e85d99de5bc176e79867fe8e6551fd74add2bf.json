He won six championships with the Bulls and led the team to two titles with three goals each. Jordan won his first championship in 1991 against Magic Johnson and the Lakers. That was followed by two consecutive titles in 1992 against the Blazers and 1993 against the Suns.\n\nChampionship rings have been part of the culture since the first NBA Finals in 1947. It’s amazing that Michael Jordan has won six such rings. The value of a championship ring remains priceless to those who receive it, as it is a souvenir of those who have worked hard to win the championship.\n\nYou can’t compare a ring won by an NBA legend like Michael Jordan to an average NBA player. Championship rings won by classic NBA teams, like the ones mentioned above, are expensive. If you buy or inherit an NBA championship ring from a legendary team like the Chicago Bulls of 1996, Boston Celtics of 1986, Lakers of 2001, or Lakers of 1987, you have a mini-bench in your closet. For example, the Herald Sun reported that a 1996 NBA championship ring from a member of the Bulls was for sale on eBay for $29,923. It is better if the team in question has performed excellently in the year in which they have won the championship.\n\nAs the league’s leading scorer and MVP, the Defensive Player of the Year never had enough of his lightness like Michael Jordan. He played the regular season to tell other players that he was better than them and that if they were in the upcoming playoffs, he would catch up with them. His only goal at any point was to focus on winning a ring at the end of the season.\n\nWinning the championship with the Houston Rockets in 1994-95 was a big deal. A ring can cost between $20,000 and $300,000. It really depends on who wears the ring. Hakeem Olajuwon had a championship ring, which was certainly a great start.\n\nI compared the constant value and relative value of the four players in the postseason to show that Michael Jordan is separating himself from the others, and the three that separate him from the six rings that matter.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win both an NCAA championship and an NBA gold medal, the others being Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson. Russell’s 11 championships are the most of any player in NBA history.\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as the greatest player of all time. He did the job at both ends of the floor, leading the Chicago Bulls to eight rings in six seasons, two of which were three-goal throws. Jordan dominated the NBA from the start, finishing with a perfect 6-0 record in the Finals, which is unlikely to happen again given the nature and dynamics of the league.\n\nBill Russell, Bob Cousy, Sam Jones and John Havlicek. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Shaquille O’Neal. Kareem, Oscar Robertson and Magic Johnson. Michael Jordan and Horace Grant had a season in which he scored 16.2 points per game in the postseason.\n\nA look at the Robin factor from year to year shows that Jordan has not benefited in any form or form from distorted seasons. His six rings make up six of the highest seven scores. He’s the only player you can’t argue with in the team.\n\nOnly four players in NBA history who haven’t played for Boston have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships during his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs. Seven of Russell’s teammates in Boston had seven or more championships. Including Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7).\n\nNo more than a handful of senior members of staff carry this rare distinction, in addition, of course, to the triumvirate of six-time champions Jordan, Pippen and Phil Jackson. Capp’s legacy is defined by his membership of the Bulls’ elite club, which has won six NBA championship titles and a complete set of club championship rings.\n\nIn fact, Jordan had six finals MVPs to the other two or two plays. As for Russell, in his first two championship teams and in his last, it was obvious he wasn’t even the second best player on the team. He was the youngest player on a team full of Hall of Famers and a veteran in his prime.\n\nThe steal and the shot, if you will, but my favorite moment of the game was the call from NBC’s Bob Costas. It’s one of the most iconic calls of all time. It was part of what made the legend of Michael Jordan so powerful. When the Bulls didn’t have the ball, you knew MJ was going to find a way to change that.\n\nDespite the fact that his doubters claimed he was just a regular-season player and would never be able to lead the Bulls into the ring, no one heard one. He was able to enjoy the taste of fame and he never looked back.\n\nAt 15, he represented the Chicago Bulls (13, 1984-93, 1995-98), the Washington Wizards and a few others in 2001-03. Jordan’s greatest years came with the Bulls in the 1990s, when he led them to six championships and as many finals appearances in eight years. He recorded a remarkable number for a player who was nearly 40 years old (35 when he was in the twilight of his career with the Wizards).\n\nIn the 1996-97 season, Jordan averaged 29.6 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists in all 82 games. In the postseason, he averaged 30.7 points, 49 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 1.8 steals as the Bulls lost just one game en route to the finals. In the final, the Bulls jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Gary Payton and the SuperSonics. But the Sonics retaliated with two straight wins, and Jordan and the Bulls iced it in Game 6.\n\nThe tip of the ring has a characteristic emblematic shape, embellished with the Bulls logo, a red stone with golden trims and horns in the middle and synthetic diamond and stone rivets on the face. The ring is engraved with 10K on the inside of Jostens Manufacturers.\n\nPlayers Name | Michael Jordan\nHow Many Rings | 6\nDrafted By | Chicago Bulls\nWon Rings With | 1990-91 Chicago Bulls, 1991-92 Chicago Bulls, 1992-93 Chicago Bulls, 1995-96 Chicago Bulls, 1996-97 Chicago Bulls, 1997-98 Chicago Bulls\nPlayers College | North Carolina\nPlayers Birthday | February 17, 1963\nHometown | Brooklyn, New York\nYear Drafted | 1984\nRound Drafted | 1\nPick Drafted | 3\nRELATED RINGS\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n"

Breaking down his NBA Finals runs\n\nBill Bender\n\nHow many championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nESPN's 10-part documentary, \"The Last Dance,\" concludes Sunday, chronicling the Chicago Bulls' dynasty in the 1990s and detailing the franchise's NBA championship runs with Michael Jordan.\n\nThe focus is on Jordan, who pushed the Bulls to those championship runs.\n\nThe full clip from #LastDanceMichael Jordan on Leadership. pic.twitter.com/vsQJpCnhfK\n\nMORE: Michael Jordan's six championship Bulls teams, ranked\n\nHow many NBA championships did Michael Jordan win?\n\nJordan led the Bulls to six NBA championships from 1991-98. The Bulls won three straight NBA championships from 1991-93 and three more from 1996-98.\n\nJordan was the NBA Finals MVP in all six NBA championship runs.\n\nWho did Jordan's Bulls beat in the NBA Finals?\n\nHere is a look at the NBA Finals runs Jordan led with Chicago\n\n1991 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat the Los Angeles Lakers — led by Magic Johnson — in five games. Jordan averaged 31.2 points per game, 11.4 assists and 6.6 rebounds in the series – which he highlighted with the iconic \"switch hands\" layup.\n\n1992 NBA Finals\n\nChicago beat Portland in six games for its second NBA championship. Jordan scored 35 of his 39 points in Game 1 – which is best remembered for \"The Shrug.\" Jordan averaged 35.8 points, 6.5 assists and 4.8 rebounds for the series.\n\n1993 NBA Finals\n\nPhoenix had NBA MVP Charles Barkley, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 41 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists for the series.\n\n1996 NBA Finals\n\nThe Bulls won 72 games in the regular season, and they beat Seattle in six games for their fourth NBA championship. Jordan led Chicago with 27.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. The Bulls clinched the series on Father's Day, which was especially meaningful for Jordan because it was first championship since his father James died.\n\n1997 NBA Finals\n\nThe Jazz had NBA MVP Karl Malone, but the Bulls won the series in six games behind Jordan, who averaged 32.3 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This series featured the famous \"Flu Game\" in Game 5 where Jordan scored 38 points despite battling flu-like symptoms.\n\n1998 NBA Finals\n\nJordan led the final NBA championship run that is being chronicled in \"The Last Dance.\" Chicago beat Utah in six games, and Jordan closed the series in Game 6 with \"The Shot\" over Byron Russell. Jordan averaged 33.5 points, four rebounds and 2.3 assists in the series.\n\nMORE: Ranking Michael Jordan's Bulls championship teammates\n\nCould Jordan have more titles?\n\nJordan retired after the 1993 season and missed most of the next two seasons, and the Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals each of those two seasons. Perhaps they make a deeper run with Jordan and face the Houston Rockets – who won back-to-back NBA championships in those two seasons.\n\nThe Bulls also reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1989 and 1990 before being eliminated by the eventual champion Detroit Pistons. Detroit also eliminated Chicago in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1988.\n\nChicago was swept in the first round by Boston in 1986 and 1987, and those Celtics teams – led by Larry Bird – reached the NBA Finals.\n\nThose are the teams that stood in the way the most against Jordan in the postseason.\n\nWhat other championships did Jordan win?\n\nJordan's success wasn't limited to the NBA. He made the game-winning shot in the 1982 NCAA men's basketball national championship game.\n\nJordan also won gold medals in the Olympics with Team USA basketball in 1984 and 1992.\n\nJordan is one of seven basketball players to win a NCAA championship, gold medal and NBA championship.The others are Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner and Magic Johnson.\n\nMORE: The key stats you need to know in the MJ vs. LeBron debate\n\nWhich player has the most NBA championships?\n\nBoston's Bill Russell has 11 championships, the most of any player in NBA history. Seven of Russell's teammates in Boston have seven or more championships. That list includes Same Jones (10), Tom Heinsohn (9), K.C. Jones (8), Satch Sanders (8), John Havlicek (8), Jim Loscutoff (7) and Frank Ramsey (7). Bob Cousy won six championships with Boston.\n\nThere are only four players in NBA history who didn't play for Boston who have at least six championships. Robert Horry won seven championships through his time with the Rockets, Lakers and Spurs.\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen won six with the Bulls, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six championships between Milwaukee and Los Angeles.\n\nA total of 14 players have five NBA championships, including NBA legends such as Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nHow does Jordan's NBA Finals record compare to LeBron?\n\nJordan comparisons always lead to LeBron James, who has nine NBA Finals appearances and three NBA championships.\n\nJordan and James both have lengthy statistical resumes, but that six-championship trump card gets played the most in the debate.\n\nJames had the Lakers at the top of the Western Conference before the season was suspended because of the outbreak of COVID-19. James turns 36 in December. Jordan retired from basketball for good when he was 40 years old after two seasons with the Washington Wizards.\n\nBill Bender\n\nBill Bender graduated from Ohio University in 2002 and started at The Sporting News as a fantasy football writer in 2007. He has covered the College Football Playoff, NBA Finals and World Series for SN. Bender enjoys story-telling, awesomely-bad 80s movies and coaching youth sports.\n\nCompany\n\nSporting News\n\n"

All Jordan cared about was championships. He had this one goal, a single point focus to win a ring at the end of the season. He played the regular season in a way that let the other players know that he was so much better than the rest of them and that when the playoffs came he was no match for them. He dominated in the playoffs, went 6-0 in the NBA finals, and never had to see a 7th game winning 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls in a stretch of 8 seasons.\n\nPlayer Full Name | Michael Jeffrey Jordan\nDate of birth | February 17, 1963\nDrafted by | Chicago Bulls\nDrafted Year | 1984, Round 1, Pick 3\nRings Count | 6 rings\nRings Years | 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, 1998\nWon Championships with | Chicago Bulls\nHow many rings does Michael Jordan have?\n\nMichael Jordan has won 6 rings in all with the Chicago Bulls.
