          "raw_content": "Top 10 Accomplishments Of Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan needs no introduction. He is one of the most famous and recognizable athletes in the world. Along with Tiger Woods, he is also in a rare company of billionaire athletes. Many kids call him only MJ, his nickname while playing in the NBA. Jordan won six titles in the NBA, broke many records, and bought a team in the sports. What are some of the biggest accomplishments of Michael Jordan?\n\nNowadays, Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets. He also owns the 23XL Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nMichael played 15 seasons in the NBA, with the Chicago Bulls, and then two with the Washington Wizards. Jordan not only won titles but managed to continue the popularity set by Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Some would say Jordan popularized the NBA around the world in the 1990s, becoming a global icon in the process.\n\nRecognized as one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan helped many brands grow larger than ever. For example, some 40 years ago, Nike played a second fiddle to Adidas and other sports brands. Bur Jordan with his Air Jordan brand helped Nike grow into this global leader for sportswear.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan made marketing much more fun and efficient. He endorsed many brands and made commercials that we still remember.\n\nLast year, he also starred as himself in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries, The Last Dance, a documentary about his last season with the Bulls.\n\nLet’s talk about Michael Jordan and his accomplishments.\n\nNCAA Championship\n\nMany fans remember Jordan as this amazing winner from his NBA days. But he won even before stepping on an NBA court. He enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. Soon, he grew into an important member of the school’s basketball team.\n\nJordan and his team won the NCAA Division I Championship in 1982 against Patrick Ewing and Georgetown University. Jordan scored the final basket of the game.\n\nAfter his junior year in 1984, he left college to join the NBA. While playing professionally, he got his bachelor’s degree in geography.\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nFrom the moment he stepped on an NBA basketball court, Jordan vowed fans. During his rookie season, he averaged 28.2 points per game on 51.5% shooting from the floor. He helped the Bulls, a team that won 35% of their games in the previous three seasons, get into the playoffs.\n\nFans loved him, and even opposing fans cheered for him. Jordan filled any arena, home court, or opposing arena. Critics and experts described him as the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls.\n\nIn December, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, with the caption reading “A Star is Born”. Fans voted him as an All-Star starter.\n\nHe capped the amazing season by winning the Rookie of the Year award. His team finished the season 38-44 but then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nMVP of the League\n\nSome would argue that Jordan should have won a couple of more MVP awards. He won the regular-season MVP award five times, in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998. There are at least two more times he could have won.\n\nIn 1993 Charles Barkley won the award, and then the two faced off in the Finals. Jordan won the battle in the Finals and earned the Finals MVP. In 1997, Karl Malone won the award, but his Jazz team lost in the Finals to Jordan.\n\nJordan is second on the list of all-time MVP winners. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has six of those in his pocket. So far, Lebron James has won the award four times.\n\nThe Free-throw Dunk\n\nMichael Jordan won the dunk contest in 1987 and 1988. During the 1980s and 1990s, stars had no problem participating in the event.\n\nAnd in 1988, Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins gave fans one of the most amazing dunk contests in history.\n\nJordan capped the win with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line. Nobody before Jordan has dunked from the free-throw line. After him, many players have copied the dunk.\n\nSix-Time NBA Champion\n\nIf there is one accomplishment that no player will touch is his Finals record. Jordan made the Finals six times and won it six times. He has never lost a Finals round. Bill Russell has 11 titles, but he lost one Finals.\n\nJordan won the title in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998. And he is one of the rare stars with a three-peat. He did it twice, from 1991 to 1993, and from 1996 to 1998.\n\nAir Jordan\n\nWe said before that Jordan single-handedly helped Nike grow into a global leader in sportswear. He signed his first deal with Nike in 1984. Today, he serves on the Nike Inc. board of directors.\n\nJordan and Nike is a fun story. Jordan didn’t actually want to sign with Nike. He preferred Adidas, but Nike gave him a better deal.\n\nUnder Nike, he launched his signature Air Jordan basketball sneaker. With the initial contract, Nike gave Jordan a generous 25% in royalties.\n\nThe sneakers proved an instant hit. They grew into popularity, with every kid around the world wanting to buy one. They wanted Jordan’s sneakers.\n\nIn 2018, Nike inked almost $2.9 billion in revenue from the Air Jordan line alone.\n\nHall of Fame\n\nMichael Jordan had one of the most amazing NBA careers ever. It is only logical that he made it into the Basketball Hall of Fame. He got into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame two times.\n\nThe first time, he got in as an individual, as part of the class of 2009. For his career, MJ averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 2.3 steals per game.\n\nAnd then in 2010, he got into the Hall as a member of the 1992 Dream Team. Jordan led that team to Olympic Gold in Barcelona. And many fans worldwide mention that event as the inspiration to play basketball. Jordan made the sports and the NBA attractive to many players around the world. Nowadays, you can find multiple European stars in the NBA. It is all thanks to MJ.\n\nMedal of Freedom\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is an award by the President of the United States. Along with the comparable Congressional Gold Medal, it is the highest civilian award in the US.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom recognizes individuals who have made an “especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the US”.\n\nJordan accepted the Medal at the White House, along with Vin Scully, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and other American icons.\n\nFirst Billionaire Athlete\n\nFun fact: Michael Jordan made only $90 million by playing in the NBA. But he earned a lot more money from endorsements and businesses. He is now the owner of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nOn his 54th birthday, Jordan entered a rare air. He got the title “first billionaire athlete”. Widely considered the greatest basketball player ever, he owns an 89% stake of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIn 2013, he sold the Jordan brand to Nike for $2.25 billion.\n\nAs of 2021, MJ has a net worth of $1.6 billion. This makes him the richest retired athlete in the world.\n\nBecoming an Internet Meme\n\nLet’s finish the list of accomplishments by Michael Jordan with a fun one. In 2009, Jordan achieved an unusual and unconventional feat. He got a meme.\n\nDuring his speech at the Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremony, photographer Stephan Savoia took a photo of Jordan crying.\n\nIn 2012, fans used that image without modification to comment on his decision to buy the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2014, his photoshopped head made it to posters on the internet message board Boxden.com.\n\nNowadays, Crying Jordan serves as one of the most popular memes in the sports world. In 2020, he again got a meme status. A screenshot from his Last Dance documentary “I took it Personal” turned into a meme as well.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nTop 10 Accomplishments Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nHow to Beat Procrastination & Submit Essays on Time\n\nTop 10 Accomplishments of Jimmy Carter\n\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\n\nComment\n\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\n\n\nLast Published on February 17, 2021 by Top Inspired\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

Jordan’s unmatched athleticism and competitive drive revolutionized the sport while winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls (1991–93, 1996–98).\n(Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)\nEducation and Olympics\nJordan grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, and entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. As a freshman, he made the winning basket against Georgetown in the 1982 national championship game. Jordan was named College Player of the Year in both his sophomore and junior years, leaving North Carolina after his junior year. He led the U.S. basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 1984 in Los Angeles and in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. The players who competed in the latter Games became known as the Dream Team.\n Britannica Quiz The Olympics Quiz\nNBA: Chicago Bulls\n 1 of 2\nAir JordanLegendary Chicago Bulls shooting guard Michael Jordan, 1988.(more)\n 2 of 2\nMichael JordanNBA legend Michael Jordan.(more)\nIn 1984 Jordan, a guard standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly became known as an exceptionally talented shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. In his first season (1984–85), he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\nIn October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA finals. After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.\nCareer stats\n\n\nPoints per game: 30.1\n\n\nTotal points: 32,292\n\n\nSteals per game: 2.3\n\n\nTotal steals: 2,514\n\n\nTotal games: 1,072\n\n\nDuring this time Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his extraordinary leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers, and his popularity reached heights few athletes (or celebrities of any sort) have known. He accumulated millions of dollars from endorsements, most notably for his Nike Air Jordan basketball shoes.\n(Read about Jordan’s role in the rise of sneaker culture.)\n\nAre you a student?\nGet a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.\nSubscribe\nThe Wizards and Charlotte Bobcats (Hornets)\nJordan remained close to the sport, buying a share of the Washington Wizards in January 2000. He was also appointed president of basketball operations for the club. However, managing rosters and salary caps was not enough for Jordan, and in September 2001 he renounced his ownership and management positions with the Wizards in order to be a player on the team. His second return to the NBA was greeted with enthusiasm by the league, which had suffered declining attendance and television ratings since his 1998 retirement. After the 2002–03 season, Jordan announced his final retirement. He ended his career with 32,292 total points and a 30.1-points-per-game average, which was the best in league history at that time, as well as 2,514 steals, then the second most ever.\nIn 2006 Jordan became minority owner and general manager of the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats (now known as the Charlotte Hornets). He bought a controlling interest in the team in 2010 and became the first former NBA player to become a majority owner of one of the league’s franchises.

He played 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) between 1984 and 2003, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[10] becoming a global cultural icon.[11] His profile on the NBA website states, \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[12][13]\n\nJordan played college basketball with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][14] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players.[15] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\".[5][14] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][14] He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[16]\n\nJordan's individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[14] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[17] He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[18] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[19] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[20] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[21] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[22][23] Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[24] The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor.\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[10][25] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[26] Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[27] That same year, President Barack Obama awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[28] As of 2025[update], his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes,[29] making him one of the richest celebrities.\n\nEarly life\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963,[30] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[30][31] He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[32][33] Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist.[34]\n\nIn 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina.[35] Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short.[36][37] Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[36] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[37] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[38] As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[39][40] after averaging 26.8 ppg,[38] 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season.[41]\n\nJordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[42] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Jordan majored in cultural geography.[43] He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist.[44][45]\n\nCollege career\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[14]\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53][54] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[55]\n\nProfessional career\nChicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[58]\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[59] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.[46] He helped the Bulls improve from 27–55 to 38–44 and qualify for the postseason for the first time since the 1980–81 season.[60] Jordan quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[61][62][63] Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described Jordan as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[63] and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[64][65] The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[66] The Bulls lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[66]\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[38][67] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[68][69] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[69][70] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[71][72] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[73] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[74] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[75] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor's single-game playoff scoring record.[76] The Celtics team, though, swept the series in three games.[66][76][77]\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[78] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][79] Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[80] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[81] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[74] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[66]\n\nJordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[82][c] and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[84] The Bulls finished 50–32,[74] and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[85] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[66] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[86]\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[87]\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[74] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[88] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[89] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[66] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[90] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[91] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[74] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[92] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[66]\n\nAfter the Bulls' previous losses to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons' defense and other teams that heavily targeted Jordan. This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style.[93][94] In his book Eleven Rings, Jackson recalled, \"I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense. I knew this would be a challenge for him.\"[95] In The Last Dance, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant to back the system.[94] Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to success for the team.[96]\n\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[74] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[97] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[98]\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls won the series in five games, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[97]  Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[99] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[100] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award[101] and cried while holding the Finals trophy.[102]\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[74] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[82] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[103]\n\nIn a Game 1 victory, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[104] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[105] The Bulls went on to defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[101] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[106]\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[82][107] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[81] upsetting him.[108] Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[109] and became the first player in NBA history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards.[101] Jordan scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[110] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[111]\n\nDuring the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[112] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[113] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[114] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[115][116] but the rumor spread widely.[117]\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \nYeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[118] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of Jordan Rides the Bus, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[117]\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[119] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[120][121] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[121] Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment.[122] However, in The Last Dance, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom.[123]\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, Jordan imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. Jordan later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, Jordan founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[124][125] In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[126] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[127]\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[128] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31.[129] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball (MLB) player.[130] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[131]\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[132][133] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[134] Jordan also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[129] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center.[135][136][137]\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[74] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[138] In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[139] During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season. On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[140] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[141] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[142] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[141]\n\nDespite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[66] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[143] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[144] and said, \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[145]\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[145] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[146] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[147]\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[148] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[149] The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[150] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[151] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[14]\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[149] The series was one of the tougher ones for Jordan as he had a 41.5% field goal percentage and his scoring average dropped nearly nine points from his average during the rest of the playoffs.[152] Nevertheless, Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time;[101] he achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[66] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][102]\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[153] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[154] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[155][156][157] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied 2–2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-winning three-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[154] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[153] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[101] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, he posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[158]\n\nThe Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[74] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[82] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[14] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[159][160] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[161]\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[162] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[162] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[162]\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[163][164][165][166] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[167] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[168] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[169] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[101] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[170] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series,[171] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[172]\n\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[173][174][175] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[176] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[177][178] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[179][180] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[177][181]\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[102] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[182][183] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[184] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[185] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[182][183]\n\nWashington Wizards (2001–2003)\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[186][187] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[188][189] Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[190] After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee,[191] and subsequent knee soreness,[192] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[193] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[194] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[193]\n\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[195][196] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them as he came off the bench in 15. Jordan averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Although Jordan turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[66] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[197] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[198] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[199][200] At several points, Jordan openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[199][200]\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[201] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[202] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[203] he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[204] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[205]\n\nNational team career\nJordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[206][207] The following year, Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[208]\n\nIn 1992, Jordan, now an NBA player, was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[209] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics. He averaged 14.9 ppg on 45% shooting from the field and 68% from the free-throw line, and was second on the team in scoring.[210] He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in.[16]\n\nPlayer profile\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards.[14] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[211] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[212][213][214] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization.[215] Jordan's fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation.[216][217]\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[14][218] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[14] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[219][220] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[221]\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[222] Early in Jordan's career, he weighed in at around 200 pounds (91 kg) and was more athletic in terms of play style.[223] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made Jordan nearly unstoppable.[224] Around this time, he bulked up to 215 pounds (98 kg) in order to adapt to the increased physicality of NBA defenses during the 1990s, sacrificing some athleticism for added strength in the post.[223] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\nThe three-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in his career, Jordan improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a three-point field goal percentage of 32%.[46] His best years shooting from three occurred in the 1989–90 and 1992–93 seasons, where he shot 37% and 35% from three, respectively (Jordan did shoot higher percentages from 1994 to 1997, but in those years, the three-point line was temporarily moved inwards).[14][225]\n\nOverall, Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 51%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which were consecutive (1988–1992). Jordan also shot 51% and 50% from the field, and 30% and 33% from three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[14]\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. He also set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[226] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. Despite his defensive prowess, the 1988 season has come under scrutiny due to the large discrepancy between Jordan's steals' numbers at home versus on the road. Such stat inflation was common, and a 2024 study by Tom Haberstroh found that there were games where Jordan was often credited with steals that could not have happened. For example, in one game, he was credited with more steals than the opposing team had live-ball turnovers.[227] Jordan ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[228] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[229] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[230]\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jordan was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[231] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[232]\n\nLegacy\nJordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving.[61][63] Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was \"one of a kind\", and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete.[233] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation.[63] After Jordan established the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as \"God disguised as Michael Jordan\".[76]\n\nJordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.[5] Jordan was a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant).[234] He also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 ppg, respectively.[17][235] By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[236] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[237] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[238] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[238]\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is among the most decorated players in NBA history.[14][239] He finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[14] Jordan was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[240] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[24] He is one of only eight players in history to achieve the basketball Triple Crown—winning an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[241][242][243] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[244] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[245] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times.[246]\n\n\"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that he is the greatest basketball player of all time.[229] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[247] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[248] The Associated Press also voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[249] He has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.[250] In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[251]\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[252][253] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up.[254][255] Commentators have also dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[256][257][258] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[259] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[260]\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[252] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[252] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[261] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[261] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[262]\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[263] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[264] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[18] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when Jordan began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[265][266] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[28] In October 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[24] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[267] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season, which replaced the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff.[268][269]\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlayoffs\nAwards and honors\nNBA\n\nUSA Basketball\n\nNCAA\n\nHigh school\n\nHalls of Fame\n\nMedia\n\nNational\n\nState/local\n\nPost-retirement\nAfter his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.[290] Jordan's previous tenure had produced mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse, although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002.[177] On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan from the role.[177] Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.[118]\n\nOver the next few years, Jordan played golf in celebrity charity tournaments and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[291] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[292][293]\n\nCharlotte Bobcats/Hornets\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[294][295] Despite his previous success as an endorser, Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[296] A decade earlier, he had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[297]\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[298] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[299] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team,[300] and the league's only African-American majority owner.[301]\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[302] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[303] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[303]\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[304] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[305]\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority for himself,[306] as well as the role of chairman.[307] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner, although he kept a minority stake.[308] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[309]\n\n23XI Racing\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[310] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[311] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[312][313] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[314][315][316] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[317] Reddick won the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series regular season championship, the first for the team.[318] 23XI Racing acquired a third charter from the defunct Stewart-Haas Racing, the No. 35 driven by Riley Herbst beginning in 2025.[319]\n\nPersonal life\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[320][321] They had three children: Jeffrey, Marcus, and Jasmine.[322] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[323][324] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[325][326]\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. Jordan listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[327] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[328]\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[329] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[330][331][332] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed that Jordan was not the father of the child.[329]\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[333] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[334][335] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[336][337] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[338] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[339]\n\nMedia figure and business interests\nEndorsements\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[340] In the early stages of his career, he appeared in an anti-drug PSA sponsored by McDonald's.[341] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[340][342]\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[343] One of his more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[340] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[344][345] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[346][347]\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[348] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[349] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[349] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[350]\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[351][352] In addition, when his power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[353] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[354] An academic study found that his first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[355]\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[356] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[357]\n\nBusiness ventures\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to Forbes, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[358] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[359][360] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal's Business Person of the Year for 2014.[361] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[362]\n\nForbes designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[363] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[364] As of 2025[update], his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes,[29] making him the fourth-richest African-American, behind David Steward, Robert F. Smith, and Alex Karp,[365] and one of the richest celebrities.[366]\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[367] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[368][369] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[368] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[370] that restaurant closed in 2018.[371] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound, Florida.[372]\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[373]\n\nPhilanthropy\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[374] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[375] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[376]\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[374] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[377] As of 2019, Jordan has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[374] In 2023, he donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[378]\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[379] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[380] The following year, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[381] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[382]\n\nAmidst the public uproar about the police shootings of two African-American men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and two deadly attacks against police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Jordan made $1 million donations to two organizations, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations. Jordan says the goal is to \"build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement.\" He also said \"I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.\"[383]\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[384] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[385][386] In 2024, he funded the opening of another Novant Health Clinic, this time in Wilmington.[387]\n\nFilm and television\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam. The film received mixed reviews,[388] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[389]\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max.[390] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[391][392] Jordan was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[393]\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[394] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[395]\n\nBooks\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n"

          "raw_content": "The Net Talks\n\nThe Legacy of Michael Jordan Era Players: Defining the Golden Age of the NBA\n\nThe 1990s are often considered the golden age of basketball, a decade dominated by the unparalleled greatness of Michael Jordan and his teammates. The Michael Jordan era players were not just athletes they were icons who helped elevate the NBA to global heights. Jordan’s transcendent ability, leadership, and competitiveness turned the Chicago Bulls into a dynasty, while rival teams forged fierce battles that became legends in their own right. This article will explore the influence of the Michael Jordan era players, highlighting their impact on the game, their unforgettable moments, and their lasting legacy.\n\nThe Michael Jordan Era: A Game-Changing Decade\n\nThe 1990s was a decade defined by Michael Jordan’s dominance. After his initial retirement in 1993, Jordan returned in 1995, only to secure three more NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, cementing his status as the greatest basketball player of all time. Michael Jordan era players were not just teammates or opponents they were part of a revolution that forever changed the landscape of professional basketball. Players like Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, and Reggie Miller helped build rivalries that fueled some of the most iconic playoff series in NBA history.\n\n\n\nThe Michael Jordan era players faced challenges on and off the court, but their ability to adapt to a fast-paced, evolving game ensured that the 1990s would be remembered as one of the most exciting periods in NBA history. Jordan’s competitive fire inspired countless players, while his teammates and rivals helped elevate the level of play. The influence of Michael Jordan era players can still be seen in today’s NBA, with players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant often citing Jordan as their biggest inspiration.\n\nKey Teammates: The Supporting Cast Behind the Bulls Dynasty\n\nNo discussion of the Michael Jordan era players would be complete without acknowledging his essential teammates who helped him build the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships during the 1990s. The chemistry between Jordan and his teammates was the backbone of the Bulls’ dominance.\n\nScottie Pippen: The Perfect Complement\n\nScottie Pippen was the most significant player to ever team up with Michael Jordan. Pippen’s versatility, defense, and ability to handle the ball made him the ideal sidekick to Jordan. As the second-best player on the Bulls, Pippen was instrumental in the team’s success, earning eight NBA All-Defensive selections and being named an All-Star multiple times. Pippen’s ability to lock down opponents and contribute offensively was crucial to the Bulls’ championships in the Michael Jordan era.\n\nSteve Kerr: The Clutch Shooter\n\nAnother key player in the Michael Jordan era was Steve Kerr, whose sharpshooting ability made him a vital asset to the Bulls’ offense. Kerr’s three-point shooting was pivotal to the Bulls’ success, especially in clutch moments. One of the most memorable plays of the Michael Jordan era was Kerr’s game-winning shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, which helped the Bulls secure their fifth title. Jordan’s dominance often overshadowed Kerr’s contribution, but his role as a reliable role player cannot be overstated.\n\nHorace Grant: The Defensive Anchor\n\nHorace Grant was one of the first key players to join the Bulls’ championship run in the early 1990s. Known for his rebounding and defense, Grant’s presence in the frontcourt was vital to the success of the Michael Jordan era. Grant helped the Bulls capture their first three-peat (1991-1993) with his defensive prowess, making it difficult for opponents to score in the paint.\n\nRivals: The Teams That Challenged the Bulls’ Dominance\n\nThe Michael Jordan era players were not just teammates but also fierce rivals. The competition from other teams in the 1990s provided some of the most thrilling matchups in NBA history. Rival players like Isiah Thomas, Reggie Miller, and Karl Malone pushed Jordan to his limits and helped define the challenges he faced on his way to six championships.\n\nIsiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons: The Bad Boys\n\nOne of the most defining rivalries for Michael Jordan era players was with Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons. The “Bad Boys” of Detroit were notorious for their physical play and tough defense, making life difficult for Jordan and the Bulls. The Pistons defeated the Bulls in back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals in the late 1980s, but Jordan’s resilience eventually overcame them in the early 1990s. The battles between Jordan and Thomas’ Pistons were fierce and laid the groundwork for the fierce competition that would define the Michael Jordan era.\n\nReggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers: The Rival That Almost Stopped Jordan\n\nReggie Miller was another player who thrived during the Michael Jordan era. Miller’s clutch shooting and competitive nature made him one of the most dangerous players of the 1990s. The Indiana Pacers were a constant threat to the Bulls during Jordan’s second stint with the team, and their matchup in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals was one of the most memorable in NBA history. Though the Bulls ultimately won, Miller’s rivalry with Jordan helped cement his place among the greatest players of the Michael Jordan era.\n\nKarl Malone and John Stockton: The Utah Jazz Threat\n\nKarl Malone and John Stockton were the cornerstones of the Utah Jazz during the Michael Jordan era. Malone, one of the most dominant power forwards in NBA history, and Stockton, the NBA’s all-time leader in assists, were the driving force behind the Jazz’s two Finals appearances in the late 1990s. The Jazz pushed the Bulls to their limits, particularly in the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals, but Jordan’s Bulls proved too much for them to overcome. Despite falling short, the rivalry between the Bulls and the Jazz remains one of the most intriguing storylines of the Michael Jordan era.\n\nThe Impact of Michael Jordan Era Players on the NBA\n\nThe influence of Michael Jordan era players extended far beyond the basketball court. Jordan’s success with the Bulls and the star power of his teammates brought global attention to the NBA. The 1990s were a time of growth for the league, and the Michael Jordan era players helped establish basketball as a global sport. The rise of international players such as Dirk Nowitzki, Toni Kukoč, and Yao Ming can be traced back to the success and popularity of the NBA in the 1990s.\n\nGlobal Expansion of the NBA\n\nThe success of the Bulls, fueled by Michael Jordan era players, helped spread the game of basketball worldwide. Jordan’s iconic dunks, clutch performances, and marketability transcended borders, turning him into a global ambassador for the sport. As the NBA grew internationally, so did the influence of players who were part of the Michael Jordan era. The 1992 Dream Team, which included Jordan, Pippen, and other legends, played a crucial role in introducing basketball to the world, forever changing the game.\n\n\n\nThe Cultural Impact of Michael Jordan Era Players\n\nOff the court, Michael Jordan era players shaped the cultural landscape of the 1990s. Jordan’s endorsement deals with brands like Nike created a new era of athlete marketing, with players becoming household names outside of the sports world. The rise of sneaker culture, especially with the iconic Air Jordan brand, was a direct result of Jordan’s popularity. Additionally, the fashion, music, and entertainment industries were influenced by the success and charisma of Michael Jordan era players, as they became symbols of success, style, and power.\n\nThe Legacy of Michael Jordan Era Players\n\nThe legacy of Michael Jordan era players is undeniable. Players like Scottie Pippen, Reggie Miller, and Charles Barkley helped make the 1990s one of the most competitive and exciting eras in NBA history. They shaped the future of the league and influenced the next generation of basketball players, including Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Dwyane Wade.

Michael Jordan is one such a figure for he revolutionized basketball and arguably helped redefine how people view athletes and sports for the rest of the world. Legendary performances, and awards that almost can’t be numbered, Michael Jordan’s accomplishments over the course of his career would indeed include cultural impact far beyond the court. Champions of the Chicago Bulls, changing trends in fashion, marketing, and the global reach of the sport, he altered his legacy as uniquely as any other such person, Michael Jordan.\n\nThis paper traces how Michael Jordan reshapes the course of basketball and stamps his footprint permanently on the world of sports culture, that covers the Michael Jordan career and impacts lastingly.\n\nGrowing Up and The Road to Glory Michael’s education in basketball began when, famously, he did not make the varsity team as a sophomore. This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nBreaking Down Michael Jordan's NBA Legacy and Impact on the Game\n\nMichael Jordan meant more to basketball than six rings.\n\nHad someone like Shaquille O'Neal won those titles, it wouldn't have had the same impact. MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

Where you choose to rank him is up to you, but regardless, he is a legend in his own right and one of the best to ever play this game. A big part of his massive resume over the years is his 10 NBA Finals appearances, along with 8 consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals on two separate teams. He has won 4 NBA championships with 3 different teams, winning Finals MVP each time. With that, I wanted to look at each of his appearances and rank them from best to worst. How do the Lebron Finals performances stack up? Let's take a look.\n\n10. 2011 NBA Finals(17.8 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 6.8 APG, 48% FG, 32% 3PT, 60% FT)The worst of the Finals performances for LeBron by far. We have never seen a meltdown like this from a superstar player in the Finals. LeBron is a legend without question, but he definitely dropped the ball in a series where Dwyane Wade showed up, ready to play. Aside from his struggles with Jason Terry and J.J. Barea, Bron just lacked the aggression we needed to see on the big stage. Many people feel this is the worst star player performance ever in NBA Finals history, and in many ways, it just might be.\n\n9. 2007 NBA Finals(22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG, 36% FG, 20% 3PT, 69% FT)In all honesty, this performance was subpar offensively, but the defenses both showed up. The Spurs were just a better team. The Cavs had a top 5 defense and held the Spurs to under 90 points in 3 of the 4 games. Game 1 was the worst performance of the series for LeBron, as he finished with 14 points on 4-16 from the field. I don’t think there needs to be a \"pass\" given for this by the fans, because most fans championed the playoff run of Bron until he ran into these Spurs, who were really good that year, but the Cavs had a fighting shot if they showed up on offense a bit more. Game 3 was another pivotal moment as Bron missed a game tying three pointer that could have sent the game to OT. All in all, yes, Bron was young, but if we can mention his amazing performance against the Pistons in the same playoff run, then his slight crumble in this Finals has to be discussed as well.\n\n8. 2014 NBA Finals(28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG, 57% FG, 52% 3PT, 79% FT)This was a Finals that perhaps was just a case of the Spurs wanting it more. The Heat never seemed to be fully engaged following the battle against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, so by the time they reached the Finals, they seemed to be easy pickings for the Spurs, who had retribution on their mind. LeBron played well enough in this series but lacked the aggression needed to push the team further. Still, Lebron put up a good performance. It just wasn’t enough. The Spurs won in 5 games by a wide margin in almost every game.\n\n7. 2018 NBA Finals (34.0 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 10.0 APG, 53% FG, 33% 3PT, 84% FT)On paper, these stats read like an amazing performance, and offensively, it was. Bron was able to go out and put on an exciting performance in Game 1, finishing with 51 points in a crushing loss in overtime. Games 2 and 3 were fairly competitive, but the Cavs were clearly outmatched. The Warriors dominated the closeout of Game 4 and won their championship in dominant fashion. Bron was solid, but his performance didn’t really give them a chance to win, except in Game 1.\n\n6. 2015 NBA Finals(35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG, 40% FG, 31% 3PT, 69% FT)A heroic effort by Lebron that took his team as far as he could, but his efficiency took a dive as a result. After a tough win in game 2 and a near choke down the stretch in game 3, the Cavs took a 2-1 lead into game 4, but the Warriors would win three straight to take the title. Lebron was excellent in spurts and carried as much as he could, but the offense was centered around him, and at times, it stalled out heavily. The defense was the calling card for the Cavs during this series, but it wasn’t enough.\n\n5. 2017 NBA Finals(33.6 PPG, 12.0 RPG, 10.0 APG, 56% FG, 39% 3PT, 65% FT)Averaging a triple double in a winning effort would have easily been the no. 1 choice. However, this comes at the hands of one of the worst finals' losses ever as the Warriors destroyed the Cavs in the first two games and had things locked down in game 5. Lebron was great offensively, but his defense suffered greatly in this series, and that’s why it is not any ranked higher. Offensively, Lebron was everywhere, and the only reason why they were in a few of those games were because of him and Kyrie. So, with that said, this finals performance is one of the greatest losing efforts, perhaps? Games 1 and 2 saw Bron focused and as a result, the Cavs looked pretty good at times, but with no ring or a hard fought 7 game loss, this cannot overtake any of his winning performances.\n\n4. 2020 NBA Finals(29.8 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 8.5 APG, 59% FG, 42% 3PT, 67% FT, Finals MVP)For all of the flack that the Bubble Ring gets, Bron still played high-level basketball. Averaging nearly a 30-point triple double in the finals, both Bron and AD were magnificent. One could argue that AD was just as good, if not slightly better overall, but Bron was clutch when it called for it. It is interesting that Bron’s greatest performance in the series came in Game 5, where the Heat pulled out the win, as Bron finished with an amazing 40 point, 13 rebound, and 7 assist game. It is a great series from Bron, of course, but in comparison to his other 3 title wins, this feels like it is right there at the bottom of the victories.\n\n3. 2012 NBA Finals(28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG, 48% FG, 19% 3PT, 83% FT, Finals MVP)The first title is important. The Heat got to the Finals and sought to make quick work of an OKC Thunder team that was young and not experienced on the big stage. For the Heat, they had something to play for. Lebron had something to play for. With that, we had the perfect storm, and it all came to a head in this series. Durant played well, and there was a fair share of questionable calls throughout the series, but LeBron and Wade worked extremely well together to pull out a victory. Lebron averaged a double double throughout the series, finishing with 28.6 PPG and 10.2 RPG as the Heat would become champions. Lebron would walk away with his first title and Finals MVP, putting the basketball world on notice that the league belonged to him.\n\n2. 2013 NBA Finals(25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG, 2.3 SPG, 45% FG, 35%, 80% FT, Finals MVP) This is one of the greatest finals ever. This is also one of the series where Bron reminded you of what you came to see. After going down 3-2 in the Finals, it looked as if the Spurs had their number and they probably would have won if Coach Pop didn’t make a bonehead decision on defense, but the truth is the truth. Bron was playing great all around basketball in those last two games of the series, and his game 6 and 7 heroics are what made the series so memorable, as his game 7 work and dagger proved he was beyond clutch. LeBron had a few games in the series where he wasn’t at his efficient best, but when push came to shove, he was there when the team needed him. Also, shoutout to Chris Bosh and Ray Allen for their contributions, as well as Dwyane Wade for stepping up alongside Bron in game 4.\n\n1. 2016 NBA Finals(29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG, 2.6 SPG, 2.3 BPG, 49% FG, 37% 3PT, 72% FT, Finals MVP)The \"greatest comeback\" in NBA Finals history. With a chance to right the wrongs of the 2015 Finals, Lebron put on three of the best games in the Finals after a slow start. He was not consistent in the first 4 games, despite a very good game 3, and when the Cavs found themselves down 3-1 in the Finals, they were written off by many and rightfully so. After some choice injuries to Golden State and a Draymond Green suspension for Game 5, the Cavs found their rhythm and did the impossible. Lebron and Kyrie both went off, putting up big games as the series came winding down, including the infamous game 7 where the block and the shot heard around the world came. Kyrie deserves a lot of credit, but Bron played out of his mind and was pivotal in completing the best NBA Finals comeback of all time. This is his magnum opus in the finals.\n\n-MH/True\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\nWritten by DAR Sports Media\n\nHome of DAR Sports Media.

          "raw_content": "Top 5 NBA Finals performances by LeBron James\n\nWhether one is into the sport of basketball or not, the name LeBron James is almost synonymous with it. James has been one of the faces of the NBA ever since he stepped foot into the league in 2003. Now in his 17th year as an NBA professional, LeBron has arguably already etched his name in the Mount Rushmore of basketball. The 6'9\" forward out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, Ohio, is easily one of the most complete players to ever live. He has been an excellent scorer, facilitator, and also defender for large parts of his glorious career.\n\nHowever, there is one black spot in James' otherwise illustrious career - his finals' record. One argument frequently used against LeBron James to squish the narrative of him being the greatest of all time, is his underwhelming NBA Finals record. James has booked himself a ticket to the NBA Finals showdown as many as nine times, yet has only managed to lift the trophy on three occasions - an achievement that sounds sub-par given his lofty standards.\n\nLeBron James now has 7,000+ career playoff points.No other player has even reached 6,000 points. pic.twitter.com/S2pk6PnTQc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, certainly, is not down to a lack of trying. LeBron James has put up some of the most ridiculous numbers one can imagine in the nine NBA Finals series he has been a part of. Unfortunately, he has often lacked ample support from his teammates. In some cases, he has just failed to gel as well with his teammates as he would've liked to - as was the case when the underdogs Dallas Mavericks beat LeBron's Miami Heat in 2011.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\n“Took care of business. That's what it's about. #LakeShow” - @KingJames pic.twitter.com/AmoCGHpncI\n\nLet us now take a lot at five of the best LeBron James performances in the NBA Finals - with or without a ring!\n\n#5 2018 vs Golden State Warriors (0-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 34.0\n\nRebounds - 8.5\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nIt might seem ridiculous to see a series where he got swept make it to the top 5, but such was the greatness of the individual performances LeBron James put up, that it simply had to be brought to notice.\n\nAfter trading away star guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, LeBron James was tasked with carrying a mediocre Cleveland Cavaliers team over the line. Against a generational team like the Golden State Warriors, the much weaker Cavaliers stood no chance. The Warriors beat the Cavs comprehensively in all four games, but had no answer to the might of LeBron James. The superstar from Akron averaged 34 points per game throughout the series, and was six rebounds away from averaging a triple-double.\n\nPerhaps game 1 of that series is the perfect example of the mismatch on display. James scored a game-high 51 points, and yet was beaten comfortably by 10 points.\n\n#4 2013 vs San Antonio Spurs (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 25.3\n\nRebounds - 10.9\n\nAssists - 7.0\n\nAppearing in his third consecutive NBA Final with the Miami Heat since forming the iconic 'big three' alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, LeBron James was determined not to allow a repeat of the 2011 debacle to happen. The 2013 San Antonio Spurs were a tough nut to crack, though.\n\nCoached by the legendary Gregg Popovich, Spurs were filled with veterans like Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, and one of the greatest players of all time in Tim Duncan. They also had the relatively young lock-down defenders in Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Spurs had championship pedigree, and throughout the series they showed time and again that they were unfazed by the prospect of facing the Miami big three.\n\nA series that went back and forth until LeBron James pulled the Heat clear in game 7 with a game-high 37 points, is best remembered for an iconic Ray Allen three in the dying moments of game 6 to save the series for James and the Heat.\n\nAs a result, people tend to forget how incredible LeBron James was in that series and particular in the do-or-die game 7. The now 35-year-old not only scored 37 points, but did so with unreal efficiency, shooting both 50% from the field and from the three-point line. He also made all eight of his free-throws.\n\n#3 2012 vs Oklahoma City Thunder (4-1 win)\n\nPoints - 28.6\n\nRebounds - 10.2\n\nAssists - 7.4\n\nIn his first finals duel with a common rival for years to come, LeBron James emphatically showed Kevin Durant he still has a long way to go before he can match up to the King. Desperate to make up for the embarrassing loss to the Dallas Mavericks the year before, James upped his game to another level. Although he shot poorly from beyond the three-point line, making only three of them the entire series, he was on a tear when it came to just about everything else.\n\nHe scored over 28 points a game, shooting an impressive 47.2% from the field. He also grabbed over 10 boards and registered over seven assists each game. More than anything, it was the way in which he bounced back from a disappointing finals performance the year before that makes this one that much special.\n\n#2 2017 vs Golden State Warriors (1-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 33.6\n\nRebounds - 12.0\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nYou need to do something special for a 1-4 loss to be applauded, and LeBron James did just that in 2017. Defeating a stacked GSW team now that they had acquired the services of Kevin Durant felt like an impossible task, even with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in LeBron James' support staff.\n\nAs was anticipated, the Cavs could not slay the three-headed demon GSW had created. That being said, none of the Warriors' three superstars could outshine King James on the court individually. James wrote basketball history as he became the first player to ever average a triple-double in the NBA Finals. He did absolutely everything a basketball player could possibly do, whilst shooting an unfathomable 56.4% from the field. He also averaged a steal and a block per game that series. One of the greatest finals performance of all time, despite for a losing cause.\n\n#1 2016 vs Golden State Warriors (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 29.7\n\nRebounds - 11.3\n\nAssists - 8.9\n\nLeBron James's Game 6 of the 2016 Finals:41 Points, 11 Assists, 8 Rebounds, 67.2 TS%, 23.5 BPMDown 3-2 to the 73-9 Warriors, LeBron showed up with arguably his best game ever. This game doesn't get talked about enough. Absolutely insaneOne of the BEST NBA Finals Games EVER pic.twitter.com/orGctRX18P\n\nProbably the greatest NBA Finals series in the recent history of the league, the 2016 Finals perforamance was definitely James' greatest in his career, especially given the backdrop of that historic series. Returning to his homeland after a successful stint with the Miami Heat, James promised the Cavaliers fans the first championship in franchise history. However, after the failure in the 2015 finals against the same team, it seemed like an improbable task.\n\nLed by the greatest shooter of all time in Stephen Curry, the Warriors went 73-9 in the regular season, breaking the regular season wins record held by the Chicago Bulls. They were destined to cruise to the championship, and were well placed at 3-1 to do just that.\n\nEnter LeBron James.\n\nJames went on a mission for the rest of that series to win three straight games for the Cavaliers, and won them the championship in unforseen fashion. Never before had a team made a comeback from 1-3 down in the finals to win the title, but James with his never-say-die attitude made the unthikable happen.\n\nHe averaged nearly a 30-point triple-double along with over 2 blocks and 2 steals in that series to write NBA history. His chase-down block to deny Andre Iguodala a simple layup is a moment that will forever be etched in NBA history, and the Cavaliers' comeback will always be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in any sport.\n\nRupam Nag\n\nMajored in economics, but more importantly, a football and basketball enthusiast for as long as I can remember.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?

            "raw_content": "Top 10 Accomplishments Of Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan needs no introduction. He is one of the most famous and recognizable athletes in the world. Along with Tiger Woods, he is also in a rare company of billionaire athletes. Many kids call him only MJ, his nickname while playing in the NBA. Jordan won six titles in the NBA, broke many records, and bought a team in the sports. What are some of the biggest accomplishments of Michael Jordan?\n\nNowadays, Jordan is the principal owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets. He also owns the 23XL Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.\n\nMichael played 15 seasons in the NBA, with the Chicago Bulls, and then two with the Washington Wizards. Jordan not only won titles but managed to continue the popularity set by Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. Some would say Jordan popularized the NBA around the world in the 1990s, becoming a global icon in the process.\n\nRecognized as one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan helped many brands grow larger than ever. For example, some 40 years ago, Nike played a second fiddle to Adidas and other sports brands. Bur Jordan with his Air Jordan brand helped Nike grow into this global leader for sportswear.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Jordan made marketing much more fun and efficient. He endorsed many brands and made commercials that we still remember.\n\nLast year, he also starred as himself in the Emmy Award-winning miniseries, The Last Dance, a documentary about his last season with the Bulls.\n\nLet’s talk about Michael Jordan and his accomplishments.\n\nNCAA Championship\n\nMany fans remember Jordan as this amazing winner from his NBA days. But he won even before stepping on an NBA court. He enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. Soon, he grew into an important member of the school’s basketball team.\n\nJordan and his team won the NCAA Division I Championship in 1982 against Patrick Ewing and Georgetown University. Jordan scored the final basket of the game.\n\nAfter his junior year in 1984, he left college to join the NBA. While playing professionally, he got his bachelor’s degree in geography.\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nFrom the moment he stepped on an NBA basketball court, Jordan vowed fans. During his rookie season, he averaged 28.2 points per game on 51.5% shooting from the floor. He helped the Bulls, a team that won 35% of their games in the previous three seasons, get into the playoffs.\n\nFans loved him, and even opposing fans cheered for him. Jordan filled any arena, home court, or opposing arena. Critics and experts described him as the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls.\n\nIn December, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, with the caption reading “A Star is Born”. Fans voted him as an All-Star starter.\n\nHe capped the amazing season by winning the Rookie of the Year award. His team finished the season 38-44 but then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nMVP of the League\n\nSome would argue that Jordan should have won a couple of more MVP awards. He won the regular-season MVP award five times, in 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1998. There are at least two more times he could have won.\n\nIn 1993 Charles Barkley won the award, and then the two faced off in the Finals. Jordan won the battle in the Finals and earned the Finals MVP. In 1997, Karl Malone won the award, but his Jazz team lost in the Finals to Jordan.\n\nJordan is second on the list of all-time MVP winners. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has six of those in his pocket. So far, Lebron James has won the award four times.\n\nThe Free-throw Dunk\n\nMichael Jordan won the dunk contest in 1987 and 1988. During the 1980s and 1990s, stars had no problem participating in the event.\n\nAnd in 1988, Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins gave fans one of the most amazing dunk contests in history.\n\nJordan capped the win with a perfect 50 dunk from the free-throw line. Nobody before Jordan has dunked from the free-throw line. After him, many players have copied the dunk.\n\nSix-Time NBA Champion\n\nIf there is one accomplishment that no player will touch is his Finals record. Jordan made the Finals six times and won it six times. He has never lost a Finals round. Bill Russell has 11 titles, but he lost one Finals.\n\nJordan won the title in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 1997, and 1998. And he is one of the rare stars with a three-peat. He did it twice, from 1991 to 1993, and from 1996 to 1998.\n\nAir Jordan\n\nWe said before that Jordan single-handedly helped Nike grow into a global leader in sportswear. He signed his first deal with Nike in 1984. Today, he serves on the Nike Inc. board of directors.\n\nJordan and Nike is a fun story. Jordan didn’t actually want to sign with Nike. He preferred Adidas, but Nike gave him a better deal.\n\nUnder Nike, he launched his signature Air Jordan basketball sneaker. With the initial contract, Nike gave Jordan a generous 25% in royalties.\n\nThe sneakers proved an instant hit. They grew into popularity, with every kid around the world wanting to buy one. They wanted Jordan’s sneakers.\n\nIn 2018, Nike inked almost $2.9 billion in revenue from the Air Jordan line alone.\n\nHall of Fame\n\nMichael Jordan had one of the most amazing NBA careers ever. It is only logical that he made it into the Basketball Hall of Fame. He got into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame two times.\n\nThe first time, he got in as an individual, as part of the class of 2009. For his career, MJ averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, 5.3 assists, and 2.3 steals per game.\n\nAnd then in 2010, he got into the Hall as a member of the 1992 Dream Team. Jordan led that team to Olympic Gold in Barcelona. And many fans worldwide mention that event as the inspiration to play basketball. Jordan made the sports and the NBA attractive to many players around the world. Nowadays, you can find multiple European stars in the NBA. It is all thanks to MJ.\n\nMedal of Freedom\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This is an award by the President of the United States. Along with the comparable Congressional Gold Medal, it is the highest civilian award in the US.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom recognizes individuals who have made an “especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the US”.\n\nJordan accepted the Medal at the White House, along with Vin Scully, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and other American icons.\n\nFirst Billionaire Athlete\n\nFun fact: Michael Jordan made only $90 million by playing in the NBA. But he earned a lot more money from endorsements and businesses. He is now the owner of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nOn his 54th birthday, Jordan entered a rare air. He got the title “first billionaire athlete”. Widely considered the greatest basketball player ever, he owns an 89% stake of the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nIn 2013, he sold the Jordan brand to Nike for $2.25 billion.\n\nAs of 2021, MJ has a net worth of $1.6 billion. This makes him the richest retired athlete in the world.\n\nBecoming an Internet Meme\n\nLet’s finish the list of accomplishments by Michael Jordan with a fun one. In 2009, Jordan achieved an unusual and unconventional feat. He got a meme.\n\nDuring his speech at the Basketball Hall of Fame induction ceremony, photographer Stephan Savoia took a photo of Jordan crying.\n\nIn 2012, fans used that image without modification to comment on his decision to buy the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2014, his photoshopped head made it to posters on the internet message board Boxden.com.\n\nNowadays, Crying Jordan serves as one of the most popular memes in the sports world. In 2020, he again got a meme status. A screenshot from his Last Dance documentary “I took it Personal” turned into a meme as well.\n\nRelated Posts\n\nTop 10 Accomplishments Of Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nHow to Beat Procrastination & Submit Essays on Time\n\nTop 10 Accomplishments of Jimmy Carter\n\nLeave a Comment Cancel reply\n\nComment\n\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\n\n\nLast Published on February 17, 2021 by Top Inspired\n\n"

However, since wins and losses are a team achievement, only lesser known statistics are listed here.\nThe longest losing streak of his career was eight games, which occurred during his third stint in the NBA, with the Washington Wizards (November 4 to 22, 2001).\nThe longest losing streak of his Chicago Bulls career was six games, which occurred twice (March 9 to 17, 1987 and April 6 to 16, 1989). This latter losing streak began with the last game of Jordan's triple-double streak.\nThe longest losing streak of the Chicago Bulls dynasty era was three games, which occurred at the very beginning of the era (November 2 to 6, 1990).\nThe longest winning streak of his career was 18 games, which occurred from December 29, 1995, to February 2, 1996. At the time, it was tied for the third longest winning steak in NBA history, and is now tied for the 11th longest winning streak in NBA history. It is the longest winning streak in Chicago Bulls franchise history.\nThe Chicago Bulls also set the NBA playoff record for consecutive road victories at eight, across the 1991 and 1992 postseasons. It was later broken by the Los Angeles Lakers during a stretch from 2001 to 2002.\nSee also[edit]\nList of NBA rookie single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-season scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual scoring leaders\nList of NBA annual steals leaders\nList of NBA annual minutes leaders\nList of NBA single-game scoring leaders\nList of NBA single-game steals leaders\nList of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career steals leaders\nList of NBA career turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career triple-double leaders\nList of NBA career free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA franchise career scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff assists leaders\nList of NBA career playoff steals leaders\nList of NBA career playoff turnovers leaders\nList of NBA career playoff 3-point scoring leaders\nList of NBA career playoff free throw scoring leaders\nList of NBA players with most championships\nList of multi-sport athletes\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Michael Jordan, North Carolina, 6-6, G/F\". sportsstats.com.

Jordan’s unmatched athleticism and competitive drive revolutionized the sport while winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls (1991–93, 1996–98).\n(Read James Naismith’s 1929 Britannica essay on his invention of basketball.)\nEducation and Olympics\nJordan grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, and entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1981. As a freshman, he made the winning basket against Georgetown in the 1982 national championship game. Jordan was named College Player of the Year in both his sophomore and junior years, leaving North Carolina after his junior year. He led the U.S. basketball team to Olympic gold medals in 1984 in Los Angeles and in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. The players who competed in the latter Games became known as the Dream Team.\n Britannica Quiz The Olympics Quiz\nNBA: Chicago Bulls\n 1 of 2\nAir JordanLegendary Chicago Bulls shooting guard Michael Jordan, 1988.(more)\n 2 of 2\nMichael JordanNBA legend Michael Jordan.(more)\nIn 1984 Jordan, a guard standing 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 meters), was drafted by the Chicago Bulls. He quickly became known as an exceptionally talented shooter and passer and a tenacious defender. In his first season (1984–85), he led the league in scoring and was named Rookie of the Year; after missing most of the following season with a broken foot, he returned to lead the NBA in scoring for seven consecutive seasons, averaging about 33 points per game. He was only the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain) to score 3,000 points in a single season (1986–87). Jordan was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) five times (1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1998) and was also named Defensive Player of the Year in 1988.\nIn October 1993, after leading the Bulls to their third consecutive championship, Jordan retired briefly and pursued a career in professional baseball. He returned to basketball in March 1995. In the 1995–96 season Jordan led the Bulls to a 72–10 regular season record, the best in the history of the NBA (broken in 2015–16 by the Golden State Warriors). From 1996 to 1998 the Jordan-led Bulls again won three championships in a row, and each time Jordan was named MVP of the NBA finals. After the 1997–98 season Jordan retired again.\nCareer stats\n\n\nPoints per game: 30.1\n\n\nTotal points: 32,292\n\n\nSteals per game: 2.3\n\n\nTotal steals: 2,514\n\n\nTotal games: 1,072\n\n\nDuring this time Jordan earned the nickname “Air Jordan” because of his extraordinary leaping ability and acrobatic maneuvers, and his popularity reached heights few athletes (or celebrities of any sort) have known. He accumulated millions of dollars from endorsements, most notably for his Nike Air Jordan basketball shoes.\n(Read about Jordan’s role in the rise of sneaker culture.)\n\nAre you a student?\nGet a special academic rate on Britannica Premium.\nSubscribe\nThe Wizards and Charlotte Bobcats (Hornets)\nJordan remained close to the sport, buying a share of the Washington Wizards in January 2000. He was also appointed president of basketball operations for the club. However, managing rosters and salary caps was not enough for Jordan, and in September 2001 he renounced his ownership and management positions with the Wizards in order to be a player on the team. His second return to the NBA was greeted with enthusiasm by the league, which had suffered declining attendance and television ratings since his 1998 retirement. After the 2002–03 season, Jordan announced his final retirement. He ended his career with 32,292 total points and a 30.1-points-per-game average, which was the best in league history at that time, as well as 2,514 steals, then the second most ever.\nIn 2006 Jordan became minority owner and general manager of the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats (now known as the Charlotte Hornets). He bought a controlling interest in the team in 2010 and became the first former NBA player to become a majority owner of one of the league’s franchises. Jordan sold his share in 2023.\nOther activities\n\nSpace Jam(From left to right): Bill Murray, Bugs Bunny, and Michael Jordan on a lobby card for Space Jam (1996).(more)\nJordan made a successful film, Space Jam (1996), in which he starred with animated characters Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck.

As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][14] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the best defensive players.[15] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"Air Jordan\" and \"His Airness\".[5][14] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Citing physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom, Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball in the Chicago White Sox organization. He returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] Jordan retired for the second time in January 1999, returning for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][14] He was selected to play for the United States national team during his college and NBA careers, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[16]\n\nJordan's individual accolades include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, 10 All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[14] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[17] He is one of only eight players to achieve the basketball Triple Crown. In 1999, Jordan was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[18] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[19] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[20] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[21] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[22][23] Jordan was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996 and to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[24] The trophy for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award is named in his honor.\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[10][25] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[26] Jordan starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film Space Jam (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. Jordan is also a co-owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[27] That same year, President Barack Obama awarded Jordan the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[28] As of 2025[update], his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes,[29] making him one of the richest celebrities.\n\nEarly life\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963,[30] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[30][31] He has two older brothers, James Jr. and Larry, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[32][33] Jordan and his siblings were raised Methodist.[34]\n\nIn 1968, the family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina.[35] Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School, where he played basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short.[36][37] Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[36] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[37] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[38] As a senior, he was selected for the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[39][40] after averaging 26.8 ppg,[38] 11.6 rebounds (rpg), and 10.1 assists per game (apg) for the season.[41]\n\nJordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[42] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where Jordan majored in cultural geography.[43] He chose this field of study because of its relationship to meteorology, as Jordan was interested in a career as a meteorologist.[44][45]\n\nCollege career\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after averaging 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, Jordan averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[14]\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina a year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53][54] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[55]\n\nProfessional career\nChicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[56] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[57] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[58]\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[59] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting.[46] He helped the Bulls improve from 27–55 to 38–44 and qualify for the postseason for the first time since the 1980–81 season.[60] Jordan quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[61][62][63] Roy S. Johnson of The New York Times described Jordan as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[63] and he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[64][65] The fans voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[66] The Bulls lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[66]\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[38][67] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[68][69] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[69][70] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[71][72] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[73] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[74] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[75] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor's single-game playoff scoring record.[76] The Celtics team, though, swept the series in three games.[66][76][77]\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[78] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][79] Jordan also demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[80] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[81] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[74] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[66]\n\nJordan led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and won his first league MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year after averaging 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[82][c] and leading the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[84] The Bulls finished 50–32,[74] and made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[85] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[66] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[86]\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8.0 rpg and 8.0 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[87]\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[74] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[88] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[89] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[66] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[90] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[91] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[74] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[92] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[66]\n\nAfter the Bulls' previous losses to the Pistons, Phil Jackson, along with assistant coach Tex Winter, focused on implementing the triangle offense to counteract the Pistons' defense and other teams that heavily targeted Jordan. This system, however, required Jordan to adjust his playing style.[93][94] In his book Eleven Rings, Jackson recalled, \"I was planning to ask Michael to reduce the number of shots he took so that other members of the team could get more involved in the offense. I knew this would be a challenge for him.\"[95] In The Last Dance, Jordan admitted he was initially reluctant to back the system.[94] Nevertheless, he eventually embraced the change, which led to success for the team.[96]\n\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[74] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[97] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[98]\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers. The Bulls won the series in five games, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[97]  Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[99] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[100] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award[101] and cried while holding the Finals trophy.[102]\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[74] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rpg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[82] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[103]\n\nIn a Game 1 victory, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[104] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[105] The Bulls went on to defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[101] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[106]\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[82][107] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[81] upsetting him.[108] Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[109] and became the first player in NBA history to win three consecutive Finals MVP awards.[101] Jordan scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[110] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[111]\n\nDuring the 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[112] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[113] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[114] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[115][116] but the rumor spread widely.[117]\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \nYeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[118] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of Jordan Rides the Bus, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[117]\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. He later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[119] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[120][121] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[121] Green and Demery were sentenced to life imprisonment.[122] However, in The Last Dance, Jordan stated that he retired due to physical and mental exhaustion from basketball and superstardom.[123]\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, Jordan imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. Jordan later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, Jordan founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[124][125] In his 1998 autobiography For the Love of the Game, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[126] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[127]\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball (MiLB) contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[128] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31.[129] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball (MLB) player.[130] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[131]\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[132][133] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[134] Jordan also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[129] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as The Spirit outside the new United Center.[135][136][137]\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[74] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[138] In March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[139] During the 1994–95 season, Jordan returned to the Bulls midway through the season. On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his comeback to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[140] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[141] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[142] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[141]\n\nDespite his 18-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[66] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[143] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[144] and said, \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[145]\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[145] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[146] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[147]\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[148] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[149] The Bulls finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[150] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[151] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[14]\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[149] The series was one of the tougher ones for Jordan as he had a 41.5% field goal percentage and his scoring average dropped nearly nine points from his average during the rest of the playoffs.[152] Nevertheless, Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time;[101] he achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[66] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][102]\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[153] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[154] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[155][156][157] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied 2–2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-winning three-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[154] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[153] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[101] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, he posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[158]\n\nThe Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[74] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[82] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[14] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[159][160] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[161]\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[162] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[162] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[162]\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[163][164][165][166] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[167] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[168] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[169] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[101] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[170] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series,[171] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[172]\n\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[173][174][175] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[176] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[177][178] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[179][180] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[177][181]\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[102] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[182][183] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[184] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[185] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[182][183]\n\nWashington Wizards (2001–2003)\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[186][187] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[188][189] Jordan would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[190] After he suffered torn cartilage in his right knee,[191] and subsequent knee soreness,[192] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[193] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[194] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[193]\n\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[195][196] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them as he came off the bench in 15. Jordan averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Although Jordan turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[66] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[197] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[198] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[199][200] At several points, Jordan openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[199][200]\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[201] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[202] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[203] he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[204] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. He received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[205]\n\nNational team career\nJordan made his debut as a college player for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[206][207] The following year, Jordan won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured young players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[208]\n\nIn 1992, Jordan, now an NBA player, was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team won two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[209] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics. He averaged 14.9 ppg on 45% shooting from the field and 68% from the free-throw line, and was second on the team in scoring.[210] He was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, and Jordan won all 30 games he took part in.[16]\n\nPlayer profile\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards.[14] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[211] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[212][213][214] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To improve his defense, Jordan spent hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization.[215] Jordan's fierce competitiveness greatly impacted his teammates, sometimes motivating them but also leading to tension and alienation.[216][217]\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[14][218] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[14] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[219][220] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[221]\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[222] Early in Jordan's career, he weighed in at around 200 pounds (91 kg) and was more athletic in terms of play style.[223] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made Jordan nearly unstoppable.[224] Around this time, he bulked up to 215 pounds (98 kg) in order to adapt to the increased physicality of NBA defenses during the 1990s, sacrificing some athleticism for added strength in the post.[223] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\nThe three-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in his career, Jordan improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a three-point field goal percentage of 32%.[46] His best years shooting from three occurred in the 1989–90 and 1992–93 seasons, where he shot 37% and 35% from three, respectively (Jordan did shoot higher percentages from 1994 to 1997, but in those years, the three-point line was temporarily moved inwards).[14][225]\n\nOverall, Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 51%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which were consecutive (1988–1992). Jordan also shot 51% and 50% from the field, and 30% and 33% from three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[14]\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. He also set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[226] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. Despite his defensive prowess, the 1988 season has come under scrutiny due to the large discrepancy between Jordan's steals' numbers at home versus on the road. Such stat inflation was common, and a 2024 study by Tom Haberstroh found that there were games where Jordan was often credited with steals that could not have happened. For example, in one game, he was credited with more steals than the opposing team had live-ball turnovers.[227] Jordan ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[228] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[229] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[230]\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that Jordan was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[231] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[232]\n\nLegacy\nJordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he was being compared to Julius Erving.[61][63] Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan was the best player he ever saw, and that Jordan was \"one of a kind\", and comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete.[233] In his first game in Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near minute-long standing ovation.[63] After Jordan established the single game playoff record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described him as \"God disguised as Michael Jordan\".[76]\n\nJordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles.[5] Jordan was a fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant).[234] He also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 ppg, respectively.[17][235] By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[236] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[237] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[238] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[238]\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is among the most decorated players in NBA history.[14][239] He finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[14] Jordan was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[240] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[24] He is one of only eight players in history to achieve the basketball Triple Crown—winning an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[241][242][243] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[244] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[245] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times.[246]\n\n\"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that he is the greatest basketball player of all time.[229] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[247] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[248] The Associated Press also voted Jordan the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[249] He has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times.[250] In the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[251]\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[252][253] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan as their role model while they were growing up.[254][255] Commentators have also dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[256][257][258] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[259] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[260]\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[252] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[252] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[261] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[261] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[262]\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[263] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[264] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, Jordan was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[18] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when Jordan began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[265][266] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[28] In October 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[24] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[267] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season, which replaced the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff.[268][269]\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlayoffs\nAwards and honors\nNBA\n\nUSA Basketball\n\nNCAA\n\nHigh school\n\nHalls of Fame\n\nMedia\n\nNational\n\nState/local\n\nPost-retirement\nAfter his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards.[290] Jordan's previous tenure had produced mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton for Jerry Stackhouse, although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002.[177] On May 7, 2003, Wizards owner Abe Pollin fired Jordan from the role.[177] Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring, he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.[118]\n\nOver the next few years, Jordan played golf in celebrity charity tournaments and spent time with his family in Chicago. He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[291] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[292][293]\n\nCharlotte Bobcats/Hornets\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[294][295] Despite his previous success as an endorser, Jordan made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[296] A decade earlier, he had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[297]\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[298] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[299] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team,[300] and the league's only African-American majority owner.[301]\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, The New York Times wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[302] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[303] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[303]\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[304] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[305]\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority for himself,[306] as well as the role of chairman.[307] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner, although he kept a minority stake.[308] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[309]\n\n23XI Racing\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[310] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[311] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[312][313] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[314][315][316] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[317] Reddick won the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series regular season championship, the first for the team.[318] 23XI Racing acquired a third charter from the defunct Stewart-Haas Racing, the No. 35 driven by Riley Herbst beginning in 2025.[319]\n\nPersonal life\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[320][321] They had three children: Jeffrey, Marcus, and Jasmine.[322] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[323][324] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[325][326]\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. Jordan listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[327] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[328]\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[329] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[330][331][332] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed that Jordan was not the father of the child.[329]\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[333] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[334][335] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[336][337] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[338] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[339]\n\nMedia figure and business interests\nEndorsements\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[340] In the early stages of his career, he appeared in an anti-drug PSA sponsored by McDonald's.[341] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[340][342]\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[343] One of his more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[340] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[344][345] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[346][347]\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[348] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film Space Jam, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[349] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[349] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[350]\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[351][352] In addition, when his power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[353] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[354] An academic study found that his first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[355]\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[356] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[357]\n\nBusiness ventures\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by Forbes as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to Forbes, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[358] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[359][360] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the Charlotte Business Journal's Business Person of the Year for 2014.[361] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[362]\n\nForbes designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[363] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[364] As of 2025[update], his net worth is estimated at $3.5 billion by Forbes,[29] making him the fourth-richest African-American, behind David Steward, Robert F. Smith, and Alex Karp,[365] and one of the richest celebrities.[366]\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[367] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[368][369] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[368] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[370] that restaurant closed in 2018.[371] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound, Florida.[372]\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[373]\n\nPhilanthropy\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[374] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[375] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[376]\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[374] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[377] As of 2019, Jordan has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[374] In 2023, he donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[378]\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[379] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[380] The following year, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[381] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[382]\n\nAmidst the public uproar about the police shootings of two African-American men, Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, and two deadly attacks against police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, Jordan made $1 million donations to two organizations, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Institute for Community-Police Relations. Jordan says the goal is to \"build trust and respect between communities and law enforcement.\" He also said \"I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.\"[383]\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[384] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[385][386] In 2024, he funded the opening of another Novant Health Clinic, this time in Wilmington.[387]\n\nFilm and television\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film Space Jam. The film received mixed reviews,[388] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[389]\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled Michael Jordan to the Max.[390] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[391][392] Jordan was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[393]\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[394] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries The Captain, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[395]\n\nBooks\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n"

            "raw_content": "The Net Talks\n\nThe Legacy of Michael Jordan Era Players: Defining the Golden Age of the NBA\n\nThe 1990s are often considered the golden age of basketball, a decade dominated by the unparalleled greatness of Michael Jordan and his teammates. The Michael Jordan era players were not just athletes they were icons who helped elevate the NBA to global heights. Jordan’s transcendent ability, leadership, and competitiveness turned the Chicago Bulls into a dynasty, while rival teams forged fierce battles that became legends in their own right. This article will explore the influence of the Michael Jordan era players, highlighting their impact on the game, their unforgettable moments, and their lasting legacy.\n\nThe Michael Jordan Era: A Game-Changing Decade\n\nThe 1990s was a decade defined by Michael Jordan’s dominance. After his initial retirement in 1993, Jordan returned in 1995, only to secure three more NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, cementing his status as the greatest basketball player of all time. Michael Jordan era players were not just teammates or opponents they were part of a revolution that forever changed the landscape of professional basketball. Players like Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, and Reggie Miller helped build rivalries that fueled some of the most iconic playoff series in NBA history.\n\n\n\nThe Michael Jordan era players faced challenges on and off the court, but their ability to adapt to a fast-paced, evolving game ensured that the 1990s would be remembered as one of the most exciting periods in NBA history. Jordan’s competitive fire inspired countless players, while his teammates and rivals helped elevate the level of play. The influence of Michael Jordan era players can still be seen in today’s NBA, with players like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant often citing Jordan as their biggest inspiration.\n\nKey Teammates: The Supporting Cast Behind the Bulls Dynasty\n\nNo discussion of the Michael Jordan era players would be complete without acknowledging his essential teammates who helped him build the Chicago Bulls’ six NBA championships during the 1990s. The chemistry between Jordan and his teammates was the backbone of the Bulls’ dominance.\n\nScottie Pippen: The Perfect Complement\n\nScottie Pippen was the most significant player to ever team up with Michael Jordan. Pippen’s versatility, defense, and ability to handle the ball made him the ideal sidekick to Jordan. As the second-best player on the Bulls, Pippen was instrumental in the team’s success, earning eight NBA All-Defensive selections and being named an All-Star multiple times. Pippen’s ability to lock down opponents and contribute offensively was crucial to the Bulls’ championships in the Michael Jordan era.\n\nSteve Kerr: The Clutch Shooter\n\nAnother key player in the Michael Jordan era was Steve Kerr, whose sharpshooting ability made him a vital asset to the Bulls’ offense. Kerr’s three-point shooting was pivotal to the Bulls’ success, especially in clutch moments. One of the most memorable plays of the Michael Jordan era was Kerr’s game-winning shot in the 1997 NBA Finals, which helped the Bulls secure their fifth title. Jordan’s dominance often overshadowed Kerr’s contribution, but his role as a reliable role player cannot be overstated.\n\nHorace Grant: The Defensive Anchor\n\nHorace Grant was one of the first key players to join the Bulls’ championship run in the early 1990s. Known for his rebounding and defense, Grant’s presence in the frontcourt was vital to the success of the Michael Jordan era. Grant helped the Bulls capture their first three-peat (1991-1993) with his defensive prowess, making it difficult for opponents to score in the paint.\n\nRivals: The Teams That Challenged the Bulls’ Dominance\n\nThe Michael Jordan era players were not just teammates but also fierce rivals. The competition from other teams in the 1990s provided some of the most thrilling matchups in NBA history. Rival players like Isiah Thomas, Reggie Miller, and Karl Malone pushed Jordan to his limits and helped define the challenges he faced on his way to six championships.\n\nIsiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons: The Bad Boys\n\nOne of the most defining rivalries for Michael Jordan era players was with Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons. The “Bad Boys” of Detroit were notorious for their physical play and tough defense, making life difficult for Jordan and the Bulls. The Pistons defeated the Bulls in back-to-back Eastern Conference Finals in the late 1980s, but Jordan’s resilience eventually overcame them in the early 1990s. The battles between Jordan and Thomas’ Pistons were fierce and laid the groundwork for the fierce competition that would define the Michael Jordan era.\n\nReggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers: The Rival That Almost Stopped Jordan\n\nReggie Miller was another player who thrived during the Michael Jordan era. Miller’s clutch shooting and competitive nature made him one of the most dangerous players of the 1990s. The Indiana Pacers were a constant threat to the Bulls during Jordan’s second stint with the team, and their matchup in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals was one of the most memorable in NBA history. Though the Bulls ultimately won, Miller’s rivalry with Jordan helped cement his place among the greatest players of the Michael Jordan era.\n\nKarl Malone and John Stockton: The Utah Jazz Threat\n\nKarl Malone and John Stockton were the cornerstones of the Utah Jazz during the Michael Jordan era. Malone, one of the most dominant power forwards in NBA history, and Stockton, the NBA’s all-time leader in assists, were the driving force behind the Jazz’s two Finals appearances in the late 1990s. The Jazz pushed the Bulls to their limits, particularly in the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals, but Jordan’s Bulls proved too much for them to overcome. Despite falling short, the rivalry between the Bulls and the Jazz remains one of the most intriguing storylines of the Michael Jordan era.\n\nThe Impact of Michael Jordan Era Players on the NBA\n\nThe influence of Michael Jordan era players extended far beyond the basketball court. Jordan’s success with the Bulls and the star power of his teammates brought global attention to the NBA. The 1990s were a time of growth for the league, and the Michael Jordan era players helped establish basketball as a global sport. The rise of international players such as Dirk Nowitzki, Toni Kukoč, and Yao Ming can be traced back to the success and popularity of the NBA in the 1990s.\n\nGlobal Expansion of the NBA\n\nThe success of the Bulls, fueled by Michael Jordan era players, helped spread the game of basketball worldwide. Jordan’s iconic dunks, clutch performances, and marketability transcended borders, turning him into a global ambassador for the sport. As the NBA grew internationally, so did the influence of players who were part of the Michael Jordan era. The 1992 Dream Team, which included Jordan, Pippen, and other legends, played a crucial role in introducing basketball to the world, forever changing the game.\n\n\n\nThe Cultural Impact of Michael Jordan Era Players\n\nOff the court, Michael Jordan era players shaped the cultural landscape of the 1990s. Jordan’s endorsement deals with brands like Nike created a new era of athlete marketing, with players becoming household names outside of the sports world. The rise of sneaker culture, especially with the iconic Air Jordan brand, was a direct result of Jordan’s popularity. Additionally, the fashion, music, and entertainment industries were influenced by the success and charisma of Michael Jordan era players, as they became symbols of success, style, and power.\n\nThe Legacy of Michael Jordan Era Players\n\nThe legacy of Michael Jordan era players is undeniable. Players like Scottie Pippen, Reggie Miller, and Charles Barkley helped make the 1990s one of the most competitive and exciting eras in NBA history.

Michael Jordan is one such a figure for he revolutionized basketball and arguably helped redefine how people view athletes and sports for the rest of the world. Legendary performances, and awards that almost can’t be numbered, Michael Jordan’s accomplishments over the course of his career would indeed include cultural impact far beyond the court. Champions of the Chicago Bulls, changing trends in fashion, marketing, and the global reach of the sport, he altered his legacy as uniquely as any other such person, Michael Jordan.\n\nThis paper traces how Michael Jordan reshapes the course of basketball and stamps his footprint permanently on the world of sports culture, that covers the Michael Jordan career and impacts lastingly.\n\nGrowing Up and The Road to Glory Michael’s education in basketball began when, famously, he did not make the varsity team as a sophomore. This did not do much to discourage him; instead, it kindled the desire in him to improve himself. By his senior year, Michael became one of the most coveted high school players in the land.\n\nHe earned a scholarship to play for the college basketball team of University of North Carolina and its legend Coach Dean Smith’s team. As a fresher, he nailed the shot that would make NCAA Championship in 1982, whereby he established himself as destined for big time playing. Three years at UNC groomed him and prepared him well for the competition in the NBA, where again, in no time, he made top by his sheer talent, work, and competitive passion.\n\nJordan was drafted third overall in the 1984 NBA draft by an entity that was then relatively unknown-the Chicago Bulls. No one ever thought this would be the start of an era that would forever change basketball.\n\nInnovating Greatness: The Michael Jordan Era of NBA SupremacyThe moment that Michael Jordan stepped into the NBA, everything changed. In this, his athleticism, skill, and tenacity all combined in such a way as not to be compared to any other player\n\nJordan had an extremely superlative season in the 1986–87 campaign, scoring 37.1 points per game, thus emerging as the first player since Wilt Chamberlain to score that high in an entire season. Jordan’s scoring appeared unstoppable as against him were evolved his notorious “Jordan rules” defensive tactics by his opposing teams in a desperate attempt to handle him.\n\nBut outside of all his individual brilliance, Jordan had to translate this talent into teamwork, and the Bulls just couldn’t outshine such competitors as the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons at the tail end of the 1980s, even with his scoring titles and MVPs. It wasn’t until coach Phil Jackson showed up with the “Triangle Offense” to orchestrate it that things really came together for the Bulls.\n\nDynasty Years: Six Championships and International StardomArguably, the golden years in Jordan’s playing career and championship years for the Chicago Bulls, to date, are the 1990s. His coach for all those years was Phil Jackson besides Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman. He led the Bulls to consecutive NBA titles in the period of 1991–1993, 1996–1998. However, his acumen in high-pressure games-Jordan was always aptly called “His Airness”-was at their best ever in the NBA Finals, where he clinched four of his six championship-winning seasons for the Bulls as the Finals MVP.\n\nAmong those, however, was one that stood out as the most important of all: the 1991 NBA Finals against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers. This game was not only going to yield a victory that would establish Jordan as a champion but also turn the guard in the NBA toward Jordan as he stole it from a previous generation of greats like Larry Bird and Magic Johnson.\n\nIn 1993, following his third consecutive championship victory, Jordan stunned the world with an announcement that he had retired from basketball due to the murder of his father and his desire to play professional baseball. However, he went back to the NBA in 1995, declaring “I’m back” in a simple release from his press office. Returning home rejuvenated the Bulls, and they completed three more championships. And yet no season ever matched the grandeur of 1995–96, when the Bulls went through a then-franchise best with an astonishing regular-season record of 72–10.\n\nCultural Significance: Jordan as International Icon\n\nThe most defining moment of transition had been Michael Jordan’s association with Nike. In 1984, Jordan agreed to a deal to have his own shoe line with Nike, named Air Jordan. The line of shoes became the most successful and iconic sneakers in history in the world for the shoe industry and turned Jordan into an icon or into a modern icon more literally. The shoes, which were called Air Jordans, were not shoes but declarations of style, of individuality, and success. Jordan’s association with Nike was a revelation that invigorated the world of modern-day athlete endorsement and branding with the motivational seal for generations of athletes after him.\n\nBut it was during the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona that he played for the United States’ “Dream Team,” when Jordan’s appeal to the world really started. That team, led by the NBA stars Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Charles Barkley, won the gold, but that was almost secondary importance; more fundamentally, it exposed the NBA to the global market, pushing the game ever further into the international arena. With Jordan, basketball enters the Olympics too and becomes a popular sport all over the world, while it turns now into the most popular game not only in Europe but also in Asia and other parts of the world.\n\nJordan was not only a sport celebrity but a household name, being used in television advertising, movies-there’s the movie Space Jam-and on television programs. He and his iconified image personified excellence, and naturally one of the most publicized celebrities of the world-to this very day-had an influence not only to basketball players, but athletes in all fields.\n\nCompetition and Work Ethic: The BenchmarkIt was also competitiveness that characterized Jordan. His pretension to win at all costs has often been described in legends and even gained a life outside basketball. Jordan seemed competitive with whatever he did-be it cards, golf, or even simple drills during practice sessions.\n\nPerhaps the most significant reason Jordan and the Chicago Bulls dynasty succeeded was that he challenged his teammates to their highest potential. He demanded from them the same sort of commitment and excellence he did for himself. Not always a popular approach at leading, it nonetheless worked. Scottie Pippen certainly came of age as one of the league’s best players under Jordan’s tutelage-a player who truly came of age under Jordan.\n\nHis commitment to training was also evident in the training he devised. His presesason training program with trainer Tim Grover became the stuff of legend as far as intensity goes, changing from that moment forward how professionals train and prepare themselves. From here on out, Jordan’s method of fitness and training will be emulated throughout every sport as these athletes look to him as the benchmark for achieving-and then maintaining-excellence.After the Basketball: Ownership and MoreHis influence did not end there. Ending his playing career once and for all in 2003, Jordan used his knowledge across the political aisle into the business side of basketball and became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets-an entity he bought in 2010. Jordan is the first former NBA player ever to own a majority interest in an NBA franchise-that tells a lot about his continued devotion to the game.\n\nSince Jordan is an owner, the Hornets, though they do not perform as well on the field as Jordan did as a player, bring greater influence of Jordan in the world of sports. That he is an owner with the NBA means that he understands the game pretty well and would want to fashion the course of the game.\n\nEven outside of basketball, Jordan has remained quite busy, exploring diverse businesses, charity work, and philanthropy. His Jordan Brand has grown into a veritable empire worth over a billion dollars and influence reverberates in realms of fashion, sports marketing among many others.\n\nConclusion: Legacy Beyond BasketballIt is not going to be the championships, MVPs, or scoring titles. Michael Jordan’s legacy will be the transformation that he brought into the game of basketball and its role in the world. He defined what a professional athlete is-to conduct oneself on the field with sports excellence, to that extent altering a culture, and to be the core of business acumen. He popularized basketball to the world, introduced the principle of sponsorships among athletes, and also inspired generations of players to fit into the mold that he had created for them.\n\nNearly two decades have gone by since Jordan last played in the league, but he is still alive today. Almost every corner of this world has been magnetized into the emulations of bits of their games after the legacy left behind by Jordan: from LeBron James and his occasional emulations of pieces of his game after Jordan, down to the worldwide basketball phenomena in China and Africa. His name will remain etched in history books in respect of greatness on or off the court, which makes Michael Jordan one of the finest sports figures ever.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n13\n\nWritten by Abid Butt\n\nDiscussing sports here\n\nResponses (13)\n\nHelp\n\nStatus\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nPress\n\nBlog\n\nPrivacy\n\nRules\n\nTerms\n\nText to speech\n\n"

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nBreaking Down Michael Jordan's NBA Legacy and Impact on the Game\n\nMichael Jordan meant more to basketball than six rings.\n\nHad someone like Shaquille O'Neal won those titles, it wouldn't have had the same impact. MJ was a global phenomenon because he won them with grace and style.\n\nBasketball had long been a big man's game. This was even true in Jordan's era. During the 1994-95 season that MJ missed, the top five players in PER were all frontcourt players (David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, Karl Malone).\n\nJordan and Scottie Pippen were in direct stylistic contrast to a league that was predicated on pounding down low, and the fans loved them for it.\n\nJordan accomplished this with superior athleticism, but also superior technique. From a standstill, he would often toy with his opponents, feinting with his pivot foot like a confident swordsman. His planted foot was attached to the floor, making it easier for him to explode away from his defender at just the right moment.\n\n\n\nJordan will be remembered as the man who could fly, but dunking was not his signature. No, MJ was a layup artist of the highest order, someone who could turn hang time into dazzling 360-degree floaters through traffic.\n\n\n\nHis style extended beyond the court as he became an international icon. He was so influential that his imprint remained as strong today as it ever did. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan is still earning $60 million annually off his shoe sales.\n\nBack in the late '80s and early '90s, Nike's \"Air Jordan\" shoe line vaulted into an unprecedented level for a sports brand. Spike Lee directed Jordan's Nike commercials using the \"It's gotta be the shoes\" slogan, and the spots became era-defining.\n\n\n\nJordan played before Internet overanalysis, but retiring in 1993 to play baseball captivated the nation. Not only was the move bold, but it was illustrative of how much Jordan had dominated the game prior to retirement.\n\nAfter three consecutive MVPs and titles (and an Olympic gold medal), Jordan could plausibly have been bored with the sport he'd conquered. There was simply nobody better, and there was no realistic challenger to Chicago's throne.\n\nRegardless of motivation, the news was met with a funeral's solemnity (below).\n\n\n\nHis time away from the game created something that had long been lacking in regard to MJ since Chicago's first championship in 1991: doubt. When Jordan returned in 1995, there was widespread doubt over whether he could ever be what he once was.\n\nThat doubt was initially validated when Chicago lost in the 1995 playoffs to the Orlando Magic. It was just the perfect setup for the Bulls, aided by the addition of Dennis Rodman, to next reel off a historic 72-win season and three more titles.\n\nIn his second act, Michael Jordan gave us the Madison Garden \"double nickel\" 55-point explosion. He also gave us \"the flu game\" and his championship-sealing shot over Byron Russell and the Jazz. That shot was supposed to be the punctuation mark.\n\nIt wasn't, because Jordan later returned to play with the Washington Wizards in 2001. Some bemoan this move, but he still averaged over 20 points per game in his final two seasons.\n\nAt age 50, Michael Jordan is remembered as basketball's greatest player ever. He's the man who represented a cultural shift from the '80s to the '90s, from the Cold War to globalization.\n\n"

Where you choose to rank him is up to you, but regardless, he is a legend in his own right and one of the best to ever play this game. A big part of his massive resume over the years is his 10 NBA Finals appearances, along with 8 consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals on two separate teams. He has won 4 NBA championships with 3 different teams, winning Finals MVP each time. With that, I wanted to look at each of his appearances and rank them from best to worst. How do the Lebron Finals performances stack up? Let's take a look.\n\n10. 2011 NBA Finals(17.8 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 6.8 APG, 48% FG, 32% 3PT, 60% FT)The worst of the Finals performances for LeBron by far. We have never seen a meltdown like this from a superstar player in the Finals. LeBron is a legend without question, but he definitely dropped the ball in a series where Dwyane Wade showed up, ready to play. Aside from his struggles with Jason Terry and J.J. Barea, Bron just lacked the aggression we needed to see on the big stage. Many people feel this is the worst star player performance ever in NBA Finals history, and in many ways, it just might be.\n\n9. 2007 NBA Finals(22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG, 36% FG, 20% 3PT, 69% FT)In all honesty, this performance was subpar offensively, but the defenses both showed up. The Spurs were just a better team. The Cavs had a top 5 defense and held the Spurs to under 90 points in 3 of the 4 games. Game 1 was the worst performance of the series for LeBron, as he finished with 14 points on 4-16 from the field. I don’t think there needs to be a \"pass\" given for this by the fans, because most fans championed the playoff run of Bron until he ran into these Spurs, who were really good that year, but the Cavs had a fighting shot if they showed up on offense a bit more. Game 3 was another pivotal moment as Bron missed a game tying three pointer that could have sent the game to OT. All in all, yes, Bron was young, but if we can mention his amazing performance against the Pistons in the same playoff run, then his slight crumble in this Finals has to be discussed as well.\n\n8. 2014 NBA Finals(28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG, 57% FG, 52% 3PT, 79% FT)This was a Finals that perhaps was just a case of the Spurs wanting it more. The Heat never seemed to be fully engaged following the battle against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, so by the time they reached the Finals, they seemed to be easy pickings for the Spurs, who had retribution on their mind. LeBron played well enough in this series but lacked the aggression needed to push the team further. Still, Lebron put up a good performance. It just wasn’t enough. The Spurs won in 5 games by a wide margin in almost every game.\n\n7. 2018 NBA Finals (34.0 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 10.0 APG, 53% FG, 33% 3PT, 84% FT)On paper, these stats read like an amazing performance, and offensively, it was. Bron was able to go out and put on an exciting performance in Game 1, finishing with 51 points in a crushing loss in overtime. Games 2 and 3 were fairly competitive, but the Cavs were clearly outmatched. The Warriors dominated the closeout of Game 4 and won their championship in dominant fashion. Bron was solid, but his performance didn’t really give them a chance to win, except in Game 1.\n\n6. 2015 NBA Finals(35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG, 40% FG, 31% 3PT, 69% FT)A heroic effort by Lebron that took his team as far as he could, but his efficiency took a dive as a result. After a tough win in game 2 and a near choke down the stretch in game 3, the Cavs took a 2-1 lead into game 4, but the Warriors would win three straight to take the title. Lebron was excellent in spurts and carried as much as he could, but the offense was centered around him, and at times, it stalled out heavily. The defense was the calling card for the Cavs during this series, but it wasn’t enough.\n\n5. 2017 NBA Finals(33.6 PPG, 12.0 RPG, 10.0 APG, 56% FG, 39% 3PT, 65% FT)Averaging a triple double in a winning effort would have easily been the no. 1 choice. However, this comes at the hands of one of the worst finals' losses ever as the Warriors destroyed the Cavs in the first two games and had things locked down in game 5. Lebron was great offensively, but his defense suffered greatly in this series, and that’s why it is not any ranked higher. Offensively, Lebron was everywhere, and the only reason why they were in a few of those games were because of him and Kyrie. So, with that said, this finals performance is one of the greatest losing efforts, perhaps? Games 1 and 2 saw Bron focused and as a result, the Cavs looked pretty good at times, but with no ring or a hard fought 7 game loss, this cannot overtake any of his winning performances.\n\n4. 2020 NBA Finals(29.8 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 8.5 APG, 59% FG, 42% 3PT, 67% FT, Finals MVP)For all of the flack that the Bubble Ring gets, Bron still played high-level basketball. Averaging nearly a 30-point triple double in the finals, both Bron and AD were magnificent. One could argue that AD was just as good, if not slightly better overall, but Bron was clutch when it called for it. It is interesting that Bron’s greatest performance in the series came in Game 5, where the Heat pulled out the win, as Bron finished with an amazing 40 point, 13 rebound, and 7 assist game. It is a great series from Bron, of course, but in comparison to his other 3 title wins, this feels like it is right there at the bottom of the victories.\n\n3. 2012 NBA Finals(28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG, 48% FG, 19% 3PT, 83% FT, Finals MVP)The first title is important. The Heat got to the Finals and sought to make quick work of an OKC Thunder team that was young and not experienced on the big stage. For the Heat, they had something to play for. Lebron had something to play for. With that, we had the perfect storm, and it all came to a head in this series. Durant played well, and there was a fair share of questionable calls throughout the series, but LeBron and Wade worked extremely well together to pull out a victory. Lebron averaged a double double throughout the series, finishing with 28.6 PPG and 10.2 RPG as the Heat would become champions. Lebron would walk away with his first title and Finals MVP, putting the basketball world on notice that the league belonged to him.\n\n2. 2013 NBA Finals(25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG, 2.3 SPG, 45% FG, 35%, 80% FT, Finals MVP) This is one of the greatest finals ever. This is also one of the series where Bron reminded you of what you came to see. After going down 3-2 in the Finals, it looked as if the Spurs had their number and they probably would have won if Coach Pop didn’t make a bonehead decision on defense, but the truth is the truth. Bron was playing great all around basketball in those last two games of the series, and his game 6 and 7 heroics are what made the series so memorable, as his game 7 work and dagger proved he was beyond clutch. LeBron had a few games in the series where he wasn’t at his efficient best, but when push came to shove, he was there when the team needed him. Also, shoutout to Chris Bosh and Ray Allen for their contributions, as well as Dwyane Wade for stepping up alongside Bron in game 4.\n\n1. 2016 NBA Finals(29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG, 2.6 SPG, 2.3 BPG, 49% FG, 37% 3PT, 72% FT, Finals MVP)The \"greatest comeback\" in NBA Finals history. With a chance to right the wrongs of the 2015 Finals, Lebron put on three of the best games in the Finals after a slow start. He was not consistent in the first 4 games, despite a very good game 3, and when the Cavs found themselves down 3-1 in the Finals, they were written off by many and rightfully so. After some choice injuries to Golden State and a Draymond Green suspension for Game 5, the Cavs found their rhythm and did the impossible. Lebron and Kyrie both went off, putting up big games as the series came winding down, including the infamous game 7 where the block and the shot heard around the world came. Kyrie deserves a lot of credit, but Bron played out of his mind and was pivotal in completing the best NBA Finals comeback of all time. This is his magnum opus in the finals.\n\n-MH/True\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\nWritten by DAR Sports Media\n\nHome of DAR Sports Media.

            "raw_content": "Top 5 NBA Finals performances by LeBron James\n\nWhether one is into the sport of basketball or not, the name LeBron James is almost synonymous with it. James has been one of the faces of the NBA ever since he stepped foot into the league in 2003. Now in his 17th year as an NBA professional, LeBron has arguably already etched his name in the Mount Rushmore of basketball. The 6'9\" forward out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, Ohio, is easily one of the most complete players to ever live. He has been an excellent scorer, facilitator, and also defender for large parts of his glorious career.\n\nHowever, there is one black spot in James' otherwise illustrious career - his finals' record. One argument frequently used against LeBron James to squish the narrative of him being the greatest of all time, is his underwhelming NBA Finals record. James has booked himself a ticket to the NBA Finals showdown as many as nine times, yet has only managed to lift the trophy on three occasions - an achievement that sounds sub-par given his lofty standards.\n\nLeBron James now has 7,000+ career playoff points.No other player has even reached 6,000 points. pic.twitter.com/S2pk6PnTQc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, certainly, is not down to a lack of trying. LeBron James has put up some of the most ridiculous numbers one can imagine in the nine NBA Finals series he has been a part of. Unfortunately, he has often lacked ample support from his teammates. In some cases, he has just failed to gel as well with his teammates as he would've liked to - as was the case when the underdogs Dallas Mavericks beat LeBron's Miami Heat in 2011.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\n“Took care of business. That's what it's about. #LakeShow” - @KingJames pic.twitter.com/AmoCGHpncI\n\nLet us now take a lot at five of the best LeBron James performances in the NBA Finals - with or without a ring!\n\n#5 2018 vs Golden State Warriors (0-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 34.0\n\nRebounds - 8.5\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nIt might seem ridiculous to see a series where he got swept make it to the top 5, but such was the greatness of the individual performances LeBron James put up, that it simply had to be brought to notice.\n\nAfter trading away star guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, LeBron James was tasked with carrying a mediocre Cleveland Cavaliers team over the line. Against a generational team like the Golden State Warriors, the much weaker Cavaliers stood no chance. The Warriors beat the Cavs comprehensively in all four games, but had no answer to the might of LeBron James. The superstar from Akron averaged 34 points per game throughout the series, and was six rebounds away from averaging a triple-double.\n\nPerhaps game 1 of that series is the perfect example of the mismatch on display. James scored a game-high 51 points, and yet was beaten comfortably by 10 points.\n\n#4 2013 vs San Antonio Spurs (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 25.3\n\nRebounds - 10.9\n\nAssists - 7.0\n\nAppearing in his third consecutive NBA Final with the Miami Heat since forming the iconic 'big three' alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, LeBron James was determined not to allow a repeat of the 2011 debacle to happen. The 2013 San Antonio Spurs were a tough nut to crack, though.\n\nCoached by the legendary Gregg Popovich, Spurs were filled with veterans like Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, and one of the greatest players of all time in Tim Duncan. They also had the relatively young lock-down defenders in Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Spurs had championship pedigree, and throughout the series they showed time and again that they were unfazed by the prospect of facing the Miami big three.\n\nA series that went back and forth until LeBron James pulled the Heat clear in game 7 with a game-high 37 points, is best remembered for an iconic Ray Allen three in the dying moments of game 6 to save the series for James and the Heat.\n\nAs a result, people tend to forget how incredible LeBron James was in that series and particular in the do-or-die game 7. The now 35-year-old not only scored 37 points, but did so with unreal efficiency, shooting both 50% from the field and from the three-point line. He also made all eight of his free-throws.\n\n#3 2012 vs Oklahoma City Thunder (4-1 win)\n\nPoints - 28.6\n\nRebounds - 10.2\n\nAssists - 7.4\n\nIn his first finals duel with a common rival for years to come, LeBron James emphatically showed Kevin Durant he still has a long way to go before he can match up to the King. Desperate to make up for the embarrassing loss to the Dallas Mavericks the year before, James upped his game to another level. Although he shot poorly from beyond the three-point line, making only three of them the entire series, he was on a tear when it came to just about everything else.\n\nHe scored over 28 points a game, shooting an impressive 47.2% from the field. He also grabbed over 10 boards and registered over seven assists each game. More than anything, it was the way in which he bounced back from a disappointing finals performance the year before that makes this one that much special.\n\n#2 2017 vs Golden State Warriors (1-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 33.6\n\nRebounds - 12.0\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nYou need to do something special for a 1-4 loss to be applauded, and LeBron James did just that in 2017. Defeating a stacked GSW team now that they had acquired the services of Kevin Durant felt like an impossible task, even with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in LeBron James' support staff.\n\nAs was anticipated, the Cavs could not slay the three-headed demon GSW had created. That being said, none of the Warriors' three superstars could outshine King James on the court individually. James wrote basketball history as he became the first player to ever average a triple-double in the NBA Finals. He did absolutely everything a basketball player could possibly do, whilst shooting an unfathomable 56.4% from the field. He also averaged a steal and a block per game that series. One of the greatest finals performance of all time, despite for a losing cause.\n\n#1 2016 vs Golden State Warriors (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 29.7\n\nRebounds - 11.3\n\nAssists - 8.9\n\nLeBron James's Game 6 of the 2016 Finals:41 Points, 11 Assists, 8 Rebounds, 67.2 TS%, 23.5 BPMDown 3-2 to the 73-9 Warriors, LeBron showed up with arguably his best game ever. This game doesn't get talked about enough. Absolutely insaneOne of the BEST NBA Finals Games EVER pic.twitter.com/orGctRX18P\n\nProbably the greatest NBA Finals series in the recent history of the league, the 2016 Finals perforamance was definitely James' greatest in his career, especially given the backdrop of that historic series. Returning to his homeland after a successful stint with the Miami Heat, James promised the Cavaliers fans the first championship in franchise history. However, after the failure in the 2015 finals against the same team, it seemed like an improbable task.\n\nLed by the greatest shooter of all time in Stephen Curry, the Warriors went 73-9 in the regular season, breaking the regular season wins record held by the Chicago Bulls. They were destined to cruise to the championship, and were well placed at 3-1 to do just that.\n\nEnter LeBron James.\n\nJames went on a mission for the rest of that series to win three straight games for the Cavaliers, and won them the championship in unforseen fashion. Never before had a team made a comeback from 1-3 down in the finals to win the title, but James with his never-say-die attitude made the unthikable happen.\n\nHe averaged nearly a 30-point triple-double along with over 2 blocks and 2 steals in that series to write NBA history. His chase-down block to deny Andre Iguodala a simple layup is a moment that will forever be etched in NBA history, and the Cavaliers' comeback will always be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in any sport.\n\nRupam Nag\n\nMajored in economics, but more importantly, a football and basketball enthusiast for as long as I can remember.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?
