Where you choose to rank him is up to you, but regardless, he is a legend in his own right and one of the best to ever play this game. A big part of his massive resume over the years is his 10 NBA Finals appearances, along with 8 consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals on two separate teams. He has won 4 NBA championships with 3 different teams, winning Finals MVP each time. With that, I wanted to look at each of his appearances and rank them from best to worst. How do the Lebron Finals performances stack up? Let's take a look.\n\n10. 2011 NBA Finals(17.8 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 6.8 APG, 48% FG, 32% 3PT, 60% FT)The worst of the Finals performances for LeBron by far. We have never seen a meltdown like this from a superstar player in the Finals. LeBron is a legend without question, but he definitely dropped the ball in a series where Dwyane Wade showed up, ready to play. Aside from his struggles with Jason Terry and J.J. Barea, Bron just lacked the aggression we needed to see on the big stage. Many people feel this is the worst star player performance ever in NBA Finals history, and in many ways, it just might be.\n\n9. 2007 NBA Finals(22.0 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 6.8 APG, 36% FG, 20% 3PT, 69% FT)In all honesty, this performance was subpar offensively, but the defenses both showed up. The Spurs were just a better team. The Cavs had a top 5 defense and held the Spurs to under 90 points in 3 of the 4 games. Game 1 was the worst performance of the series for LeBron, as he finished with 14 points on 4-16 from the field. I don’t think there needs to be a \"pass\" given for this by the fans, because most fans championed the playoff run of Bron until he ran into these Spurs, who were really good that year, but the Cavs had a fighting shot if they showed up on offense a bit more. Game 3 was another pivotal moment as Bron missed a game tying three pointer that could have sent the game to OT. All in all, yes, Bron was young, but if we can mention his amazing performance against the Pistons in the same playoff run, then his slight crumble in this Finals has to be discussed as well.\n\n8. 2014 NBA Finals(28.2 PPG, 7.8 RPG, 4.0 APG, 57% FG, 52% 3PT, 79% FT)This was a Finals that perhaps was just a case of the Spurs wanting it more. The Heat never seemed to be fully engaged following the battle against the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals, so by the time they reached the Finals, they seemed to be easy pickings for the Spurs, who had retribution on their mind. LeBron played well enough in this series but lacked the aggression needed to push the team further. Still, Lebron put up a good performance. It just wasn’t enough. The Spurs won in 5 games by a wide margin in almost every game.\n\n7. 2018 NBA Finals (34.0 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 10.0 APG, 53% FG, 33% 3PT, 84% FT)On paper, these stats read like an amazing performance, and offensively, it was. Bron was able to go out and put on an exciting performance in Game 1, finishing with 51 points in a crushing loss in overtime. Games 2 and 3 were fairly competitive, but the Cavs were clearly outmatched. The Warriors dominated the closeout of Game 4 and won their championship in dominant fashion. Bron was solid, but his performance didn’t really give them a chance to win, except in Game 1.\n\n6. 2015 NBA Finals(35.8 PPG, 13.3 RPG, 8.8 APG, 40% FG, 31% 3PT, 69% FT)A heroic effort by Lebron that took his team as far as he could, but his efficiency took a dive as a result. After a tough win in game 2 and a near choke down the stretch in game 3, the Cavs took a 2-1 lead into game 4, but the Warriors would win three straight to take the title. Lebron was excellent in spurts and carried as much as he could, but the offense was centered around him, and at times, it stalled out heavily. The defense was the calling card for the Cavs during this series, but it wasn’t enough.\n\n5. 2017 NBA Finals(33.6 PPG, 12.0 RPG, 10.0 APG, 56% FG, 39% 3PT, 65% FT)Averaging a triple double in a winning effort would have easily been the no. 1 choice. However, this comes at the hands of one of the worst finals' losses ever as the Warriors destroyed the Cavs in the first two games and had things locked down in game 5. Lebron was great offensively, but his defense suffered greatly in this series, and that’s why it is not any ranked higher. Offensively, Lebron was everywhere, and the only reason why they were in a few of those games were because of him and Kyrie. So, with that said, this finals performance is one of the greatest losing efforts, perhaps? Games 1 and 2 saw Bron focused and as a result, the Cavs looked pretty good at times, but with no ring or a hard fought 7 game loss, this cannot overtake any of his winning performances.\n\n4. 2020 NBA Finals(29.8 PPG, 11.8 RPG, 8.5 APG, 59% FG, 42% 3PT, 67% FT, Finals MVP)For all of the flack that the Bubble Ring gets, Bron still played high-level basketball. Averaging nearly a 30-point triple double in the finals, both Bron and AD were magnificent. One could argue that AD was just as good, if not slightly better overall, but Bron was clutch when it called for it. It is interesting that Bron’s greatest performance in the series came in Game 5, where the Heat pulled out the win, as Bron finished with an amazing 40 point, 13 rebound, and 7 assist game. It is a great series from Bron, of course, but in comparison to his other 3 title wins, this feels like it is right there at the bottom of the victories.\n\n3. 2012 NBA Finals(28.6 PPG, 10.2 RPG, 7.4 APG, 48% FG, 19% 3PT, 83% FT, Finals MVP)The first title is important. The Heat got to the Finals and sought to make quick work of an OKC Thunder team that was young and not experienced on the big stage. For the Heat, they had something to play for. Lebron had something to play for. With that, we had the perfect storm, and it all came to a head in this series. Durant played well, and there was a fair share of questionable calls throughout the series, but LeBron and Wade worked extremely well together to pull out a victory. Lebron averaged a double double throughout the series, finishing with 28.6 PPG and 10.2 RPG as the Heat would become champions. Lebron would walk away with his first title and Finals MVP, putting the basketball world on notice that the league belonged to him.\n\n2. 2013 NBA Finals(25.3 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 7.0 APG, 2.3 SPG, 45% FG, 35%, 80% FT, Finals MVP) This is one of the greatest finals ever. This is also one of the series where Bron reminded you of what you came to see. After going down 3-2 in the Finals, it looked as if the Spurs had their number and they probably would have won if Coach Pop didn’t make a bonehead decision on defense, but the truth is the truth. Bron was playing great all around basketball in those last two games of the series, and his game 6 and 7 heroics are what made the series so memorable, as his game 7 work and dagger proved he was beyond clutch. LeBron had a few games in the series where he wasn’t at his efficient best, but when push came to shove, he was there when the team needed him. Also, shoutout to Chris Bosh and Ray Allen for their contributions, as well as Dwyane Wade for stepping up alongside Bron in game 4.\n\n1. 2016 NBA Finals(29.7 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 8.9 APG, 2.6 SPG, 2.3 BPG, 49% FG, 37% 3PT, 72% FT, Finals MVP)The \"greatest comeback\" in NBA Finals history. With a chance to right the wrongs of the 2015 Finals, Lebron put on three of the best games in the Finals after a slow start. He was not consistent in the first 4 games, despite a very good game 3, and when the Cavs found themselves down 3-1 in the Finals, they were written off by many and rightfully so. After some choice injuries to Golden State and a Draymond Green suspension for Game 5, the Cavs found their rhythm and did the impossible. Lebron and Kyrie both went off, putting up big games as the series came winding down, including the infamous game 7 where the block and the shot heard around the world came. Kyrie deserves a lot of credit, but Bron played out of his mind and was pivotal in completing the best NBA Finals comeback of all time. This is his magnum opus in the finals.\n\n-MH/True\n\n--\n\n--\n\n1\n\nWritten by DAR Sports Media\n\nHome of DAR Sports Media.

        "raw_content": "Top 5 NBA Finals performances by LeBron James\n\nWhether one is into the sport of basketball or not, the name LeBron James is almost synonymous with it. James has been one of the faces of the NBA ever since he stepped foot into the league in 2003. Now in his 17th year as an NBA professional, LeBron has arguably already etched his name in the Mount Rushmore of basketball. The 6'9\" forward out of St. Vincent-St. Mary, Ohio, is easily one of the most complete players to ever live. He has been an excellent scorer, facilitator, and also defender for large parts of his glorious career.\n\nHowever, there is one black spot in James' otherwise illustrious career - his finals' record. One argument frequently used against LeBron James to squish the narrative of him being the greatest of all time, is his underwhelming NBA Finals record. James has booked himself a ticket to the NBA Finals showdown as many as nine times, yet has only managed to lift the trophy on three occasions - an achievement that sounds sub-par given his lofty standards.\n\nLeBron James now has 7,000+ career playoff points.No other player has even reached 6,000 points. pic.twitter.com/S2pk6PnTQc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat, certainly, is not down to a lack of trying. LeBron James has put up some of the most ridiculous numbers one can imagine in the nine NBA Finals series he has been a part of. Unfortunately, he has often lacked ample support from his teammates. In some cases, he has just failed to gel as well with his teammates as he would've liked to - as was the case when the underdogs Dallas Mavericks beat LeBron's Miami Heat in 2011.\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\n“Took care of business. That's what it's about. #LakeShow” - @KingJames pic.twitter.com/AmoCGHpncI\n\nLet us now take a lot at five of the best LeBron James performances in the NBA Finals - with or without a ring!\n\n#5 2018 vs Golden State Warriors (0-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 34.0\n\nRebounds - 8.5\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nIt might seem ridiculous to see a series where he got swept make it to the top 5, but such was the greatness of the individual performances LeBron James put up, that it simply had to be brought to notice.\n\nAfter trading away star guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, LeBron James was tasked with carrying a mediocre Cleveland Cavaliers team over the line. Against a generational team like the Golden State Warriors, the much weaker Cavaliers stood no chance. The Warriors beat the Cavs comprehensively in all four games, but had no answer to the might of LeBron James. The superstar from Akron averaged 34 points per game throughout the series, and was six rebounds away from averaging a triple-double.\n\nPerhaps game 1 of that series is the perfect example of the mismatch on display. James scored a game-high 51 points, and yet was beaten comfortably by 10 points.\n\n#4 2013 vs San Antonio Spurs (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 25.3\n\nRebounds - 10.9\n\nAssists - 7.0\n\nAppearing in his third consecutive NBA Final with the Miami Heat since forming the iconic 'big three' alongside Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, LeBron James was determined not to allow a repeat of the 2011 debacle to happen. The 2013 San Antonio Spurs were a tough nut to crack, though.\n\nCoached by the legendary Gregg Popovich, Spurs were filled with veterans like Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, and one of the greatest players of all time in Tim Duncan. They also had the relatively young lock-down defenders in Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green. Spurs had championship pedigree, and throughout the series they showed time and again that they were unfazed by the prospect of facing the Miami big three.\n\nA series that went back and forth until LeBron James pulled the Heat clear in game 7 with a game-high 37 points, is best remembered for an iconic Ray Allen three in the dying moments of game 6 to save the series for James and the Heat.\n\nAs a result, people tend to forget how incredible LeBron James was in that series and particular in the do-or-die game 7. The now 35-year-old not only scored 37 points, but did so with unreal efficiency, shooting both 50% from the field and from the three-point line. He also made all eight of his free-throws.\n\n#3 2012 vs Oklahoma City Thunder (4-1 win)\n\nPoints - 28.6\n\nRebounds - 10.2\n\nAssists - 7.4\n\nIn his first finals duel with a common rival for years to come, LeBron James emphatically showed Kevin Durant he still has a long way to go before he can match up to the King. Desperate to make up for the embarrassing loss to the Dallas Mavericks the year before, James upped his game to another level. Although he shot poorly from beyond the three-point line, making only three of them the entire series, he was on a tear when it came to just about everything else.\n\nHe scored over 28 points a game, shooting an impressive 47.2% from the field. He also grabbed over 10 boards and registered over seven assists each game. More than anything, it was the way in which he bounced back from a disappointing finals performance the year before that makes this one that much special.\n\n#2 2017 vs Golden State Warriors (1-4 loss)\n\nPoints - 33.6\n\nRebounds - 12.0\n\nAssists - 10.0\n\nYou need to do something special for a 1-4 loss to be applauded, and LeBron James did just that in 2017. Defeating a stacked GSW team now that they had acquired the services of Kevin Durant felt like an impossible task, even with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in LeBron James' support staff.\n\nAs was anticipated, the Cavs could not slay the three-headed demon GSW had created. That being said, none of the Warriors' three superstars could outshine King James on the court individually. James wrote basketball history as he became the first player to ever average a triple-double in the NBA Finals. He did absolutely everything a basketball player could possibly do, whilst shooting an unfathomable 56.4% from the field. He also averaged a steal and a block per game that series. One of the greatest finals performance of all time, despite for a losing cause.\n\n#1 2016 vs Golden State Warriors (4-3 win)\n\nPoints - 29.7\n\nRebounds - 11.3\n\nAssists - 8.9\n\nLeBron James's Game 6 of the 2016 Finals:41 Points, 11 Assists, 8 Rebounds, 67.2 TS%, 23.5 BPMDown 3-2 to the 73-9 Warriors, LeBron showed up with arguably his best game ever. This game doesn't get talked about enough. Absolutely insaneOne of the BEST NBA Finals Games EVER pic.twitter.com/orGctRX18P\n\nProbably the greatest NBA Finals series in the recent history of the league, the 2016 Finals perforamance was definitely James' greatest in his career, especially given the backdrop of that historic series. Returning to his homeland after a successful stint with the Miami Heat, James promised the Cavaliers fans the first championship in franchise history. However, after the failure in the 2015 finals against the same team, it seemed like an improbable task.\n\nLed by the greatest shooter of all time in Stephen Curry, the Warriors went 73-9 in the regular season, breaking the regular season wins record held by the Chicago Bulls. They were destined to cruise to the championship, and were well placed at 3-1 to do just that.\n\nEnter LeBron James.\n\nJames went on a mission for the rest of that series to win three straight games for the Cavaliers, and won them the championship in unforseen fashion. Never before had a team made a comeback from 1-3 down in the finals to win the title, but James with his never-say-die attitude made the unthikable happen.\n\nHe averaged nearly a 30-point triple-double along with over 2 blocks and 2 steals in that series to write NBA history. His chase-down block to deny Andre Iguodala a simple layup is a moment that will forever be etched in NBA history, and the Cavaliers' comeback will always be remembered as one of the biggest shocks in any sport.\n\nRupam Nag\n\nMajored in economics, but more importantly, a football and basketball enthusiast for as long as I can remember.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers Fan?
