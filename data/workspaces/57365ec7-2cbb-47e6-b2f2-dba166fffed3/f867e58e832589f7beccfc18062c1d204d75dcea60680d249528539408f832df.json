        "raw_content": "Jordan vs. LeBron: Who’s the NBA’s G.O.A.T. in terms of cultural impact?\n\nSHARE\n\nWhenever anyone talks about the Greatest of all Time (G.O.A.T.) conversation in the NBA, it’s either LeBron James or Michael Jordan. They’re both great players and regardless of what happens, the decision is ultimately going to be subjective.\n\nWith the conclusion of “The Last Dance,” a 10-part docu-series during Jordan’s tenure with the Chicago Bulls reigniting the G.O.A.T. conversation, I decided to look at both James’ and Jordan’s cultural impact as a whole to determine who is the NBA’s G.O.A.T.\n\nA few clarifications: I’m focusing strictly on sneaker sales and pop culture references. This means songs, movies, shows and social media presence.\n\nAnd so, without further ado, let’s dive into the Jordan vs. LeBron debate.\n\nSneaker Sales\n\nSneakers are one of the biggest ways that a professional athlete can enhance their cultural impact. Although James is on his 17th signature sneaker with Nike, Jordan completely blows that out of the water with 34 signature sneakers. That said, Jordan only had 14 signature sneakers during his playing days but that’s neither here nor there.\n\nWhen it comes to sneaker sales, “Air Jordan” skies above all else: Jordan and Jordan Brand made $130 million in 2018 solely on sneakers alone, according to Forbes. Additionally in 2019, Jordan Brand posted its first billion-dollar quarter. Meanwhile, James made $32 million in 2018.\n\nIt also helps that Jordan Brand has the ability to retro and re-release sneakers from Jordan’s playing days, as the annual Air Jordan XI holiday drops are some of the more sought after sneakers on the market. Plus, with collaborations with Drake, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and many others, it’s easy to see who’s the G.O.A.T. when it comes to sneakers.\n\nWinner: Jordan\n\nPop Culture References: Songs\n\nThere’s a saying that musicians want to be athletes and athletes want to be musicians. However, since it’s extremely unlikely that a person can be both, musicians try to be an athlete the best way they can: through lyricism. That’s why it’s not outside the realm of possibility to hear songs about James and Jordan since their athleticism and finesse, respectively, captivated audiences around the world.\n\nBecause of how many songs come out with references to James and Jordan, it is almost impossible to count all of them. On one side, you can hear Ice Cube or Biggie Smalls rap about Jordan. On the other, you have Jay-Z, Drake and others talking about James. Regardless of which side you choose, it’s fair to say that you can’t go wrong with either.\n\nWinner: Draw\n\nPop Culture References: Movies/Shows\n\nRegarding movies and TV shows, James has used his immense popularity to branch out to other forms of media. James has over 30 credits when it comes to movies and TV shows as either a producer or playing himself, according to IMDB. On the other hand, Jordan only has six credits, with “Space Jam” being the most popular.\n\nStrictly in terms of credits, James soundly beats Jordan. But in terms of pop culture relevance, Jordan has the edge because “Space Jam” is still one of the most popular sports movies of all time. Additionally, the relevance of “Space Jam” some 25 years later ushered in a new wave of fans, mainly because of the popularity of the Air Jordan XI “Space Jam” and “Toon Squad” jersey.\n\nAlthough James is producing and starring in a new iteration of “Space Jam,” it may not have the same cultural impact as the original.\n\nWinner: Jordan\n\nSocial Media Presence\n\nThere is no doubt who is the G.O.A.T. when it comes to social media presence. Even though Jordan has over 20 million combined followers on Instagram and Twitter, James has 45.9 million followers on Twitter alone. On Instagram, James has 64.2 million followers, totaling to over 100 million on his two main platforms.\n\nNot only that, but James frequently uses his incredible reach to speak about social issues concerning minorities and people of color. It’s not outside the realm of possibility to see James at the forefront of any movement. He’s not afraid to alienate those who may not agree with him and knows that his influence is his most powerful weapon.\n\nIt’s pretty clear who the G.O.A.T. is concerning social media presence.\n\nWinner: James\n\nJordan vs. LeBron: Who is the NBA’s cultural impact G.O.A.T.?\n\nTaking everything into account, it’s clear that the NBA’s G.O.A.T. when it comes to cultural impact is Jordan.\n\nThe fact that everything he did and everything that Jordan Brand continues to do is at the forefront of pop culture is a testament to his impact on the cultural landscape.\n\nAt the same time, Jordan could learn a thing or two from James when it comes to athlete activism; the former is infamously tight-lipped while the latter is very outspoken. Jordan saying “Republicans buy sneakers, too” justifying his apolitical stance was egregious then and remains to be today.\n\nJordan has become more open about his political views but he’s still way behind James on that front. Nevertheless, Jordan can take pride in the fact that he’s the NBA’s cultural impact G.O.A.T.\n\nMore About:NBA\n\n"

Introduction\nThe debate of who is basketball’s GOAT has been ongoing for years, with fans and analysts comparing the two players’ skills, achievements, and impact on the game. Both Jordan and James have left a lasting legacy in the NBA, making it a difficult decision for many to determine who is the greatest of all time. While Jordan is often praised for his six championships and unbeatable competitive spirit, James has also garnered respect for his versatility and longevity in the league. Ultimately, the GOAT debate may never have a definitive answer, as both players have solidified their places in basketball history.\nMichael Jordan, known for his 6 NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, is often praised for his scoring ability and competitiveness. On the other hand, LeBron James, a 4-time NBA champion with the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Los Angeles Lakers, is recognized for his versatility and playmaking skills on the court.\nOur aim is to try and inform your decision on who is your G.O.A.T. with all the right statistics and background information. This paper will analyze various aspects of both players’ careers, including statistics, accolades, and impact on the game, in order to provide a comprehensive comparison. Ultimately, we hope to shed light on the ongoing debate and help readers make an informed decision on who they believe is the greatest basketball player of all time.\nPrime Lebron James & Michael Jordan\n\nII. Early Life and Career Beginnings: Michael Jordan\nMichael Jordan’s childhood begins in the town of Wilmington, North Carolina where he moved at a young age after being birthed in Brooklyn, New York. He was a stellar multi-sport athlete in the sports baseball, football, and basketball but that wasn’t enough for his hometown high school of Emsley A. Laney High School. He was cut from the school varsity team in his sophomore year but soon made it back as their star athlete. After high school he played in the NCAA where he led his team to a D1 championship in only his freshman year. The following years as both a sophomore & junior he was named the NCAA college player of the year which added to his early collection of accolades. The only reason his stellar college run was cut short was because he left to join the NBA. Jordan, part of the ‘84 draft class, was drafted 3rd overall  by the Chicago Bulls.\nJordan’s school picture day at his Elementary School\n\nII. Early Life and Career Beginnings: LeBron James\nLebron James’s childhood was difficult to say the least. He was born to an ex-con for a father and to his mom, Gloria, when she was only 16 years old. Early in his life, he moved 6+ times, missing over a 100 days of school which showed that his parent(s) never paid attention to his education, shedding a spotlight on how he was led to sports. His first sport played was Football, which Lebron saw as his favorite sport when he was young. Finally warming up to his life, he was forced to move again. He led his hometown Akron basketball team to three state titles and was named “Mr. Basketball” in Ohio for three straight years. He decided not to go to college and went straight to the NBA where he was the number 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft. Drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers, his path to success got off to a rocky but strong start.\n-Sports Illustrated\n\nIII. Career Achievements\nEarly on Jordan demonstrated his prowess by averaging 28.2 points a game winning rookie of the year (ROTY). He won his first championship in 1991 and went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to two three-peats in the 1990s. He then “having no more to prove” retired in October 1993 to go play for a minor league baseball team. One season later he returned to the Bulls late in the 1994-95 season to lead them to another 3 championships in the years ’96-98. He retired for a second time in January 1999. He went on to buy a share of the Washington Wizards and also became the president of basketball operations on the team. He returned to basketball again to join the Wizards and became the first player aged 40+ to score more than 40 PPG. Jordan’s final retirement from basketball appeared in May 2003.Overall, Jordan made 6 finals appearances with a total of 6 finals wins.\nTotals: Six-time NBA champion (1991-93, 1996-98); MVP (1988, ’91, ’92, ’96, ’98); 10-time All-NBA First Team (1987-93, 1996-98); All-NBA Second Team (1985); Defensive Player of the Year (1988); Nine-time All-Defensive First Team (1988-93, 1996-98); Rookie of the Year (1985); 14-time All-Star; All-Star MVP (1988, ’96, ’98); One of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (’96); Olympic gold medalist (1984, ’92).\nLebron’s first championship came in 2012 with the Miami Heat with 27.1 PPG, followed by two more with the Heat in 2013 and the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020, solidifying his status as one of the greatest players of all time. Additionally, his four MVP awards showcase his consistent excellence and impact on the game throughout his career. Lebron had a total of 10 Finals appearances, which he won 4 out of showcasing his capability to fight to the top even without as much support as other teams have had.\nLeBron James has been selected to the All-Star game a total of 17 times, further highlighting his dominance and impact on the league. He has also won one scoring title in 2008, displaying his versatility and ability to excel in different aspects of the game. In comparison, Jordan has been selected to the All-Star game 14 times and has won 10 scoring titles, solidifying his status as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – Jordan\n\nOff the court, Michael Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and his global brand cannot be understated. His influence transcends the sport, as seen through his successful Jordan Brand which continues to be a powerhouse in the world of sneakers and apparel. Jordan’s legacy extends far beyond his playing days, solidifying his status as a true icon in both sports and popular culture. The Jordan brand’s roots actually come from his parents. Not only did Jordan not begin with Nike, he actually started the deal with Converse & Adidas. Adidas was known as Jordan’s personal favorite, but when Nike offered him 250,000 – more than double Adidas offered – and a signature shoe, his parents urged him to take the deal. There are now 39 main flagship models with thousands of styles. Jordan serves as an inspiration no matter where he is to both NBA players and children alike. His skills and increasing influence led fans not only in the USA, but also across the entire world to hear of his prowess and in turn boost television viewership. Finally, by becoming a stake in the Charlotte Hornets, this showcased his commitment to not only playing but also coaching the new generation of basketball.\n\nA public school founded by LeBron James in Akron, Ohio.\nIV. Off-Court Influence and Legacy – LeBron\nConversely, Lebron has had tremendous impact, exemplified by his nickname King James, or the Chosen One. His records are seemingly unbreakable with over 40 thousand points in the regular season, additionally, James has scored 40+ points against all 30 teams.  His philanthropy has taken roots in higher education, mentoring, advocacy, after-school programs, and early childhood development or learning. The LeBron James Family Foundation has raised over 100 Million for these causes. Finally, LeBron, after struggling with poverty as a child, works towards better education for those children now. As LeBron James has not retired yet, his influence is only yet to grow and the rest is history.\n\nV. Conclusion\nOverall, Lebron and Jordan have both made significant contributions to society through their philanthropic efforts and social activism. While Jordan’s impact on basketball culture and global brand is undeniable, LeBron has also used his platform to create positive change in the world. Both players have left a lasting legacy that extends beyond the basketball court, solidifying their status as true icons in sports and popular culture. Finally, it all comes down to personal preference and interpretation of the facts.

        "raw_content": "Could LeBron James Ever Surpass Michael Jordan's Cultural Impact?\n\nLeBron James may one day become the cash-stacking, trend-setting pan-media mogul Michael Jordan is. But if he ever reaches that level, he'll owe a debt to the man who blazed the trail.\n\nThat's because the basketball-player-as-business-icon game, driven by the commodification of cool and the sale of sneakers, is still one dominated by the man himself.\n\nJames: Trying His Best\n\nAccording to Kurt Badenhausen of Forbes.com, James makes an estimated $20 million per year from Nike. His signature shoes accounted for approximately $300 million in sales in 2013, making them the most lucrative of any active player's specific kicks.\n\nHis equity in Beats headphones earned him a reported $30 million when Apple bought the company. He's a pitch man for McDonald's and a ubiquitous presence in television ads for Samsung. He also collects loads of cash from endorsements in Asia that include Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins.\n\nA partnership with Fenway Sports Management netted James part ownership of Liverpool FC, which is among the most popular clubs in parts of the world outside the U.K.—especially Asia.\n\nAll told, Forbes estimates James has made $326 million in endorsements since coming into the league as a teenage phenom, including $53 million last season. He collected more than $50 million in each of the past two years between his salary and endorsements, and his year-over-year earnings have increased consistently since 2003-04.\n\nChump change.\n\nJordan: Still Dominating\n\nThat $300 million in sales of James' signature shoe sounds impressive...until you learn Jordan brand apparel did $2.25 billion in the same year, according to another report from Badenhausen. Jordan didn't collect more than a fraction of that number, but he still made an estimated $90 million last year (20 percent more than James without an NBA salary).\n\nAnd for Jordan, being a cultural icon isn't solely about the money, though James will almost certainly have to become MJ's rival in finance before we consider him equal in sphere of influence.\n\nJordan's legend (and it is a legend, by the way, which is another reason LeBron has so far to go to catch him; James is merely human at this point) is about more than cash. It's about creating a brand, cultivating cool.\n\nWhen Jordan signed a $500,000 deal with Nike in 1984 for a signature shoe, the NBA did everything it could to stop him. It banned his shoes and fined him $5,000 in every game he wore them.\n\nCombining his business sense with his inborn defiance, Jordan rocked them anyway. And Nike picked up the tab on the fines.\n\nThat's a cool move. Jordan flouted the rules. He stood up to the power structure, which, viewed in context with his otherwise very uncontroversial public life (he deliberately avoided stances on touchy political issues), seems shocking in retrospect.\n\nIt's hard to know if Jordan benefited from such a guerrilla start to his life in business, but it's worth noting that he triumphed in a market that was far harder to navigate than the one James exists in today. Now, instead of banning shoes, the league pushes Kia Optimas out onto the court for Blake Griffin to jump over in dunk contests.\n\nJordan taught a reluctant NBA that the best way to market itself was through individual players, but he had to fight to do it. And you'd have to assume he'll continue to fight for his market primacy.\n\nAll the cash Jordan makes is one thing, but his continued recognizability and approval make it tough to imagine James overtaking him.\n\nPer Badenhausen: \"Jordan’s Q score, which gauges awareness and popularity, has been tops among sports fans every year since 1991. His 25 million Facebook fans are 43 percent more than any other U.S. athlete.\"\n\nThe fact that MJ is more recognizable and popular than James right now, despite the fact that His Airness hasn't done the thing that initially made him famous for over a decade, is remarkable. In fact, it makes it difficult to imagine LeBron ever surpassing Jordan in that regard.\n\nTo do so, James would have to become significantly more popular than he is right now, which seems almost impossible.\n\nA New World\n\nJordan built his empire in the pre-Internet age, which makes his rise that much more astounding. At the same time, James understands how the world has shrunk, and he's been better than Jordan at utilizing social media and technology to grow his brand in avenues MJ never considered.\n\nPerhaps that's the secret. Perhaps James will find more ways to reach his fans, to influence culture.\n\nHe already has his own app, and he's diving into television production, with two shows set to premiere this year. In terms of multimedia, James is already ahead of Jordan—even if he's still being actively influenced by His Airness.\n\n\"I'm really excited about helping develop Becoming and bringing this kind of program to kids,\" James said in a statement, via ESPN.com. \"Sports and athletes were my inspiration growing up. It was the stories about Michael Jordan, Deion Sanders and Allen Iverson that kept me dreaming. When I learned that they had some of the same struggles and challenges I did, it made everything seem possible.\"\n\nYounger fans (if not this generation, then the next) may not relate to Jordan the same way they will to LeBron—especially if the latter is making his way into their smartphones and TV sets. At some point, MJ will become the guy whose logo is on a pair of shoes, and it's even possible some especially young fans won't even realize Jordan once played.\n\nAsk a bunch of 15-year-olds whose likeness is on the NBA logo (it's Jerry West, kids), and you're likely to get far more shrugged shoulders than you would from a group of 30-year-olds. The same thing could happen here.\n\nIf Jordan is just a guy with a cigar on a golf course to young fans, maybe he's not as cool as someone still winning titles on the court and setting trends everywhere else. Then again, there are plenty of brands that maintain influence and cultural ubiquity long after their namesakes have faded away. Maybe Jordan is Levi Strauss or James Barclay.\n\nWho knows?\n\nGetting by Giving\n\nJames is in his prime, on TV, playing hoops, pitching products and capitalizing on his popularity. He's everywhere.\n\nJordan is in full icon mode. You don't see him often, and he's becoming a bit more withdrawn (a cool guy move if ever there was one) as he ages. He sits back and smirks at the world while James sprints up to smile and shake its hand.\n\nHis days of changing things are over. He already pioneered the shaved head, the longer shorts, the endless string of chill-inducing commercials.\n\nJames has yet to put those kinds of stamps on the game and its fans.\n\nBut he has an opportunity to do something Jordan never did. He can use his social conscience to make an impact through charity.\n\nThat's not to say Jordan wasn't concerned with effecting change outside of his own bank account and reputation. But it's hard to ignore the way James has made giving back a priority.\n\nPer Sam Amick of USA Today, James explained:\n\nI'm 11 years in, (and) I feel like I'm in a great place as far as my professional career and I feel like as far as off the court, that's the more meaningful thing for me. I believe my calling is much higher than basketball, and I will continue to use that tool to continue to inspire because it has helped out a lot.\n\nWe've never heard anything like that from Jordan.\n\nIf James ever reaches MJ's level of fame and influence, this is how he'll do it: with a far more human touch.\n\nHomage to the Master\n\nLeBron's public-relations missteps (The Decision, principally) have made him more eager to please, while Jordan never had to make amends during his career. Playing at a time when the media wasn't salivating for schadenfreude certainly helped.\n\nJordan commodified cool, but he did it with a complicit press that ate it up and rarely tried to tear it down.\n\nNobody stays on top forever, and James is definitely making progress toward Jordan's throne as an icon. If the young gun ever catches the old dog, he'll owe his predecessor a great deal.\n\nBecause even if James eventually does it better, Jordan did it first.\n\n"

He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\nPoints per shot attempt\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\nPoints per season\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n\nTop Family Doctors In Las Vegas You Need To SeeFamily Doctor: Options availableBest Family Doctors| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn more\nUndo\nLas Vegas: Three Banks Introduce 5% Interest Rates on SavingsSavings Accounts | Search Ads| [Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:)[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&utm_source=usatodaydemo&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=thumbnails-feed-original-05:Below%20Article%20Thumbnails%20-%20Feed%20Redesign%20|%20Card%201:) Learn More\nUndo\nAbandoned Houses For Sale in Las Vegas -
