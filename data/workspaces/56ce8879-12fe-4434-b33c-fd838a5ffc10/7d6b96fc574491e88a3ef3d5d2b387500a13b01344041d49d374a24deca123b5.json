        "raw_content": "5 ways LeBron James has made a huge impact off the court\n\n\n\nChristian Alamodin\n\nLeBron James is one of the best basketball players to ever step on the court. He's completely transformed the sport since his NBA debut in 2003, with similar players following in his footsteps since.\n\nWhat makes LeBron James a very interesting player to see is how vocal and influential he is off the court as well.\n\nThere have been plenty of instances where the King showed everyone just how influential he can be. Here are five ways LeBron James made his presence felt throughout the league.\n\nThe financial boom he brings to cities\n\nLeBron James is not just a player, but he is also a big brand. He's got the Midas touch. His talent and charisma make him one of the most sought-after athletes in the world, and companies are always at his door, looking to cash in on his brand.\n\nIn fact, cities that were in contention for the LeBron James Sweepstakes in 2018 weren't only anticipating his arrival in terms of his talent to dribble the ball.\n\nIt was revealed by Selena Hill of Black Enterprise that cities would feel a massive boost to their books, with New York getting a $1.7 billion boost to their economy if he made the move to the Big Apple.\n\nMoreover, Fortune's Sarah Gray revealed that James's arrival to the City of Angels would be bringing up to $400,000,000 in profit for the city and create up to 3,000 jobs in the food industry, as establishments within a mile of Staples Center would pop up like mushrooms.\n\nJames knows that Black Lives Matter\n\nGrowing up under duress in Akron, OH, James knew how tough a rough background can be. He also understands that the system as it is now is not working fairly for people of color.\n\nJames has been a staunch critic of police brutality against African Americans and called for accountability on the police force. Moreover, he's not shy to tackle the racism he and his people are facing every day.\n\nWhile he's been told by analysts to shut up and dribble, he's not afraid to use his privilege as an NBA superstar to bring up racial injustices.\n\n‚ÄúI know there‚Äôs a lot of tragic things happening in Charlottesville,‚Äù James says, per CNBC's Ruth Umoh. ‚ÄúI have this platform, and I‚Äôm somebody that has a voice of command, and the only way for us to get better as a society and for us to get better as people is love. And that‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôre going to be able to conquer something as one.‚Äù\n\nJames speaks up on national issues\n\nJames' opinions aren't limited to racial injustices. He also takes an active stand on national policy, not afraid to let his opinions on politics and pressing national issues be heard.\n\nHe's not afraid to call out people who he thinks are acting like a bum. He was very involved in the 2016 campaign of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He happily gave his opinion on any social issues that transcended the basketball court.\n\nThe greatest thing about LeBron James speaking up is that he made it okay for the rest of the league to let their opinions be known about social issues. He helped the NBA become one of the most socially involved professional sports league in the United States.\n\nHis continuous philanthropy to his native Ohio\n\nLBJ may have traded the Cavalier wine for the Laker gold, but they can never take away the Akron out of the man. His charity, the LeBron James Family Foundation, is continuously involved in the community.\n\nJames commits a certain amount of his money in ensuring that the kids in the community get programs and initiatives that will help them grow up in a kinder and more holistic environment.\n\nThe biggest project of his foundation yet is the I PROMISE Institute.\n\nJames is a perfect role model for young kids to aspire to be\n\nJames made a few questionable basketball decisions in his career.\n\nHe's married to his high school sweetheart and has three kids with her. He's visible and involved in his children's lives, and his support for his son's blossoming basketball career is nothing short of adorable.\n\nHe doesn't forget his roots and is always involved in his hometown. He also shows his intelligence as he's not afraid to talk about politics. He's presented himself as a well-rounded person who has done a lot of right things. He's a perfect role model for kids to follow.\n\nChristian Alamodin is a writer for ClutchPoints.\n\nüö® Get viral NBA graphics, memes, rumors and trending news\n    delivered right to your inbox with the Clutch Newsletter.\n\n"

The off-court achievement that James is most proud of, he says, is working to uplift the lives of people like Smiley in his hometown of Akron.\n\nMany athletes have excelled in one or more of these areas. But few have done all of them as well as James, who is closing in on passing¬†Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA‚Äôs career scoring record.\n\n‚ÄúHis goal, I believe, is to have 10% of his wealth go to causes and support communities, which is an amazing goal,‚Äù said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, a professor of sports management at George Washington University. ‚ÄúI would say he‚Äôs maybe above and beyond others, just on that aspiration alone.‚Äù\n\nJames is, by any measure, an overwhelming success.

Although James bounced from home to home during his childhood, and experienced financial insecurity for many of those years, he also was given enormous support from friends, neighbors and educators.\n\nThe LeBron James Family Foundation, founded in 2004, at first gained local attention by giving away bikes and backpacks. Then it began looking at after-school programs, with students scattered across several dozen schools, and eventually created a public school currently serving about 575 third through eighth graders. Today the school includes a family resource center that provides a wide-range of services to parents, including mental health, financial literacy, legal aid and GED courses.\n\nJust down the street from the school, the foundation provides rent-free housing to as many as 16 different families ‚Äî when needed ‚Äî and it has plans to build 50 units of affordable housing.\n\n‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt have guessed how much it would grow,‚Äù James said in late January. ‚ÄúBut we got here by listening and responding to our community and what they need.‚Äù\n\nJames has made over $400 million in NBA salary during his time with Cleveland, Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. Another $100 million is on the way in the next 2-1/2 years or so.\n\nJames is a pitchman for Nike, GMC, AT&T and many more multinational companies.

I gotta get to the locker room to start my process to get ready for the next game.\n\n\"I'll be sitting in the locker room, foot on an ice bag, ice bags on. I got my smoothie and my fruit, and I'm already getting to it right now. ... During a loss they was like, 'Oh, he's a poor sport.' Like, he's leaving the court. ... And then they start seeing me doing it during the wins and they was like, 'He's got no sportsmanship!'\"\n\nEvery second counts for @KingJames. √∞¬ü¬í¬™√∞¬ü¬è¬æEpisode 2 is out now: https://t.co/pwk8BEr2F6 pic.twitter.com/ouYGmkl7AS\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, as James was recently seen dapping up Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler following the Lakers' loss to the Golden State Warriors last week. Even with The King's unmatched stamina and durability throughout his 22 years and counting in the league, it makes sense that sometimes he just wants to go home and rest his feet after a grueling game.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\nKristen Wong is a staff writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.
