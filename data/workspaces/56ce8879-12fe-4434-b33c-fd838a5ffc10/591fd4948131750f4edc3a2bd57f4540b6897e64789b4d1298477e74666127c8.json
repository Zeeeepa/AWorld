The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSport | Basketball\nLeague | National Basketball Association\nAwarded for | Most valuable playerof theNBA Finals\nHistory\nFirst award | 1969\nMost wins | Michael Jordan(6 awards)\nMost recent | Jaylen Brown(1st award)\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nContents\n\nWinners\n\n^ | Denotes player who is still active in the NBA\n* | Elected to theNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n§ | 1st time eligible for Hall of Fame in

          "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

Don't be the person yelling \"six rings\" with no backup plan.\nHere's a closer look at where the GOAT debate stands...\n(All stats current as of Jan. 29, 2025)\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season stats\nOn a per-game basis, Jordan is superior in the scoring department, but James grabs rebounds and dishes out assists at a higher rate. While both players are known for tenacious defense on the wing, Jordan finished first in the league in steals three times in his career. James has not yet claimed a steals title.\nMICHAEL JORDAN AUTHENTIC JERSEYS — BULLS, DREAM TEAM, UNC AND MORE\nSHOP NOW\nIn terms of longevity, James holds a clear advantage. The gap in total numbers will widen as long as James stays healthy, and he doesn't appear to be slowing down at age 40.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n30.1    Points  27.0\n6.2 Rebounds    7.5\n5.3 Assists 7.4\n2.3 Steals  1.5\n0.8 Blocks  0.7\n2.7 Turnovers   3.5\n38.3    Minutes 37.8\n49.7    Field goal %    50.6\n32.7    3-point %   34.9\n83.5    Free throw %    73.6\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n1,072   Games   1,534\n32,292  Points  41,474\n6,672   Rebounds    11,504\n5,633   Assists 11,385\n2,514   Steals  2,311\n893 Blocks  1,134\n2,924   Turnovers   5,374\n41,011  Minutes 58,059\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season advanced stats\nIt's all about which category you choose when it comes to advanced statistics. VORP and Win Shares favor James, but PER and Box Plus/Minus go to Jordan.\nPick a side, nerds! (That's a term of endearment.)\nJordan  Advanced    LeBron\n27.9    Player Efficiency Rating    27.0\n116.1   Value Over Replacement  154.5\n9.2 Box Plus/Minus  8.6\n214.0   Win Shares  267.7\n56.9    True Shooting % 59.0\n33.3    Usage % 31.5\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Playoff stats\nThe playoff statistics mirror what Jordan and James produce during the regular season. Despite James' increased usage and efficiency from beyond the arc over the course of his career, it's worth noting that he shoots the same percentage as Jordan from 3-point range.\nOh, and the lazy narrative claiming James shrinks in big games — his postseason lines are often more impressive than his regular-season performances. That's not a smart way to argue against him.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n33.4    Points  28.4\n6.4 Rebounds    9.0\n5.7 Assists 7.2\n2.1 Steals  1.7\n0.9 Blocks  1.0\n3.1 Turnovers   3.6\n41.8    Minutes 41.3\n48.7    Field goal %    49.7\n33.2    3-point %   33.2\n82.8    Free throw %    74.1\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n179 Games   287\n5,987   Points  8,162\n1,152   Rebounds    2,583\n1,022   Assists 2,067\n376 Steals  483\n158 Blocks  275\n546 Turnovers   1,034\n7,474   Minutes 11,858\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Playoff advanced stats\nJordan stands above James in PER, and he is the all-time playoff leader in Box Plus/Minus. But James tops everyone in VORP and Win Shares.\nSo, yeah, these guys are pretty good.\nJordan  Advanced    LeBron\n28.6    Player Efficiency Rating    27.9\n24.7    Value Over Replacement  36.1\n11.1    Box Plus/Minus  10.0\n39.8    Win Shares  58.7\n56.8    True Shooting % 58.4\n35.6    Usage % 31.7\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Accolades and awards\nAnd here's the big one. Jordan fans have championships in their back pockets. MJ went a perfect 6-0 in the NBA Finals and never needed a Game 7 to win those series.\nJames has gone 4-6 in his 10 NBA Finals appearances, but he also controlled the Eastern Conference with the Cavaliers and Heat for almost an entire decade.\nJordan  Accolades   LeBron\n6   Championships   4\n5   MVPs    4\n6   Finals MVPs 4\n11  All-NBA 20\n9   All-Defense 6\n14  All-Star    20\n10  Scoring titles  1\nJORDAN GREER\nJordan Greer has been with The Sporting News since 2015.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James vs Michael Jordan playoff records: Total sweeps, win and loss record, win percentage and more\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate will likely never stop. These two players are considered the best of all time, which is why many basketball fans love to debate who's better.\n\nNearly everyone knows that Jordan had a perfect 6-0 record in the NBA Finals. However, he had to go through many struggles to get there. LeBron, on the other hand, has won only four championships, but has advanced to the final stage 10 times.\n\nDue to the reports of LeBron James' retirement, let's take a look at how well these two legends performed in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate mostly ignores Jordan's playoff struggles\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate often ignores Jordan's early struggles in the playoffs. While the Chicago Bulls guard was 6-0 in the finals, he was eliminated several times in the first round.\n\nDuring his glorious career, Jordan was 119-60 in playoff games, winning 30 out of 37 (81.1%) series. His winning percentage was 66.4%, meaning that he won two out of three games on average.\n\nJordan was swept twice in his career, both times by the Boston Celtics. The first time this happened was in the 1986 NBA playoffs, and the second time was just a year later.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: Top 10 most undeserving NBA All-Star Selections of All Time featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan & more\n\nJordan's Chicago Bulls swept nine teams during his career. However, it's important to note that the NBA used the best-of-five series format in the first round while Jordan was in the league. Due to this, a sweep required only three wins.\n\nThe Bulls legend won nine out of 30 series with a sweep, meaning that he swept his opponent in 30% of the series, which is remarkable.\n\nLeBron James has been swept three times. The first time, James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the 2007 NBA Finals in four games. The second time was in the 2018 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, while the third time was against the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals.\n\nLeBron's all-time playoff record is 182-100, good enough for a 64.5% win percentage.

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

          "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nNBA\n\nThe top 25 NBA Finals performances of all time\n\nAs this year's Finals take place with the Miami Heat facing the Denver Nuggets, we're looking back at legendary performances from superstars such as LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Michael Jordan, with the help of Basketball-Reference.com's game score archive.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nNBA experts' picks for Heat-Nuggets and Finals MVP1y\n\nThe six things you need to know for this epic NBA Finals2yKirk Goldsberry\n\nNBA Finals 2023: Schedule, news, highlights, scores, more316dESPN\n\nGame score, pioneered by John Hollinger, is a measure of a player's single-game value factoring in all elements of the box score from scoring efficiency to playmaking to rebounding and defensive impact. Although imperfect, it quickly captures a player's baseline performance and allows us to compare conference finals games going back to 1978 -- the first year the NBA tracked individual turnovers.\n\nOver that span of 45 years of NBA Finals, we've highlighted the top 25 individual performances, 16 of which came in victories for their team. How did each player succeed and what did their heroics mean for the series and the NBA playoffs as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the top conference finals performances, highlighted by four from James and two from Jimmy Butler, who will look to add to his total in the games to come.\n\n-- Kevin Pelton\n\n1. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 42.5\n\n2016 Finals: Game 6 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\nBy now you've seen the viral clip of James in the Cavs' locker room after Game 6 of the 2016 Finals, putting the 15th piece of the team's 16-piece Larry O'Brien Trophy championship puzzle in place while telling his team the Warriors are \"f---ed up ... mentally and physically.\" He dealt a fair portion of that damage with 41 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Cleveland jumped out to a 31-11 lead after the first quarter and won by 15 points to set up a Game 7 for the ages.\n\n-- Dave McMenamin\n\n2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 42.0\n\n2021 Finals: Game 6 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nWith the Bucks one win away from winning their first NBA title in 50 years, all it took was Antetokounmpo having one of the greatest games in Finals history to end their drought.\n\nAntetokounmpo finished with 50 points on 16-for-25 shooting from the field to go along with 14 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 blocks was one thing. But for him to also go 17-for-19 from the free throw line, after all of the chatter about his foul shooting during the postseason, was the definition of rising to meet the moment.\n\nAnd, as a result, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks were able to celebrate a championship on their home floor in Milwaukee.\n\n-- Tim Bontemps\n\n3. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 42.0\n\n2020 Finals: Game 3 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nButler carried the Heat throughout their time in the 2020 Orlando, Florida, Bubble, but never more so than in Game 3 of the Finals against James and the Lakers. Butler scored 40 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a win that not only kept the Heat in the series, but further cemented his status as one of the game's premiere playoff players. Butler played 45 minutes, leaving everything he had on the floor while making big play after big play all night.\n\n-- Nick Friedell\n\n4. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 41.3\n\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nWith his team's season hanging in the balance in the bubble, Butler delivered another all-time performance to the tune of 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a Game 5 victory over the Lakers. Butler knew he had to set a tone for the rest of his teammates and that's exactly what he did, following up his Game 3 showcase with another game that will be remembered within the Heat organization for years. Aside from Butler's ability to make big plays all over the floor, the picture of an exhausted Butler from this game remains one of the most memed in history.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n5. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 41.3\n\n2018 Finals: Game 1 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\nIn the greatest game of James' individual postseason run, the star forward became just the fifth player in league history to top 50 points in an NBA Finals game, joining Elgin Baylor (61), Michael Jordan (55), Rick Barry (55) and Jerry West (53) with 51 points. He also had 8 rebounds and 8 assists, all against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. The masterful performance still wasn't enough to get a win, as the Warriors prevailed in overtime with two crucial sequences going against the Cavs. First, James was called for a blocking foul on Kevin Durant with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two. Had it been a charge, maybe things would have been different. And second, in one of the most memed moments of James' career, JR Smith dribbled out the clock when George Hill missed a free throw with four seconds left with the score tied, rather than go for the go-ahead bucket near the hoop, causing James to splay his arms toward his teammate in exasperation.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n6. Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs | Game score: 40.8\n\n2003 Finals: Game 6 vs. New Jersey Nets\n\nDuncan set the tone for the Spurs' Finals defeat of the Nets with an all-time box-score stuffing performance in the series opener: 32 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, 7 blocks and 3 steals. It was the most blocks and steals ever recorded in a 30-20 Finals outing and the third-most assists. Duncan was almost as dominant in the closeout Game 6, putting up a 21-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist, 8-block line to clinch his second Finals MVP.\n\n-- Tim MacMahon\n\n7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 39.8\n\n2018 Finals: Game 3 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nAny time the Warriors needed a big play in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers, Durant delivered. He had 43 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists, but it was a clutch 3-pointer over two Cavs defenders with 52 seconds left that sealed both the game and his place in Finals history. An all-time dagger from an all-time player. Durant would go on to win his second straight Finals MVP and lead the Warriors to their second consecutive title.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n8. Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.6\n\n1980 Finals: Game 6 vs. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nTop stories of the week from\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• NHL Urgency Index: Who needs to win now? »\n• CFB 2026 recruiting class rankings »\n• Predicting which NFL teams will draft QBs »\n More ESPN+ content »\n\nJohnson, who was a year removed from leading Michigan State to the NCAA title, stepped into the starting center role for the Finals closeout game with legendary big man Kareem Abdul-Jabbar staying in Los Angeles to nurse a badly sprained ankle. \"Never fear, Magic is here!\" Johnson told his teammates as they boarded the flight to Philadelphia. Johnson delivered the best Finals performance ever by a rookie, scoring 42 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and dishing out 7 assists to lead the Lakers to the first of their five championships in the Showtime era.\n\n-- MacMahon\n\n9. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 39.2\n\n2016 Finals: Game 5 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\n\"What did you say Klay [Thompson] said?\" James asked a reporter prior to Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals. \"Klay said, 'I guess he just got his feelings hurt,'\" the reporter replied, detailing Thompson's response to James' run-in with Draymond Green in Game 4. Then James burst out an indulgent chuckle. It was the start of the most significant postseason stretch of his career, winning Games 5 through 7 to help the Cavaliers become the first team in Finals history to climb out of a 3-1 deficit and win. James was brilliant in Game 5, putting up 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks as he and Kyrie Irving became the first pair of teammates to ever drop 40-plus in the same Finals game. The comeback was on.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n10. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.1\n\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Miami Heat\n\nMuch like the Smith game in the 2018 Finals, James' brilliance in Game 5 of the 2020 Finals sometimes gets forgotten, because of the attention paid to Danny Green's potential game-winning 3-pointer from the top of the key missing with under 10 seconds remaining. But the fact that James nearly closed out the bubble by making 15 out of 21 shots -- including 6-of-9 3s -- to score 40 points with 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals while wearing the \"Black Mamba\" uniform that held so much significance to the Lakers' franchise that season in remembering Kobe Bryant makes it one of the finest playoff games of James' or any other player's career.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n11. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls | Game score: 38.9\n\n1993 Finals: Game 4 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nJordan scored nearly half of the Bulls' points with a 55-point outburst in Game 4 of the 1993 Finals. It was one of the highest scoring performances in Finals history and put the Bulls on the verge of their first three-peat.\n\nChicago won the first two games of the series on the road before dropping Game 3 after returning home, but Jordan would not allow the Suns back into the series. Phoenix had no answer in stopping him from getting to the rim and Jordan shot 56.8% from the field with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. Jordan's 55 points are tied for the second-most in Finals history, trailing only a 61-point game by Baylor in 1962.\n\n-- Jamal Collier\n\n12. Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 37.9\n\n2000 Finals: Game 1 vs. Indiana Pacers\n\nShaq's 2000 series against Indiana was one of the most dominant Finals ever, as he averaged 38.0 PPG to rank third in Finals history behind Jordan in 1993 (41.0) and Baylor in 1962 (40.6). Fresh off a Game 7 comeback to beat the Portland Trail Blazers, O'Neal served the Pacers notice in the series opener at the then-Staples Center, putting up 41 points on 21-of-31 shooting and 19 rebounds as the Lakers pulled away late. The 21 field goals were one shy of Baylor's 1962 Finals record, which came on 15 more shot attempts.\n\n-- Pelton\n\n13. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 37.4\n\n2021 Finals: Game 3 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nWhen the Bucks returned home from Phoenix down 2-0 in the Finals, it looked like their storybook season would wind up being anything but.\n\nThat's where Antetokounmpo came in. With a loss all but certain to end Milwaukee's season, Antetokounmpo made sure that would not happen, going for 41 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists in just under 38 minutes, while also going -- in a precursor to his truly legendary performance in Game 6 -- 13-for-17 from the foul line. It wound up being the first of four straight wins for the Bucks in the series, as Milwaukee would go on to win its first title since 1971.\n\n-- Bontemps\n\n14. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 37.2\n\n2019 Finals: Game 3 vs. Toronto Raptors\n\nThe barrage of shots from all over the floor started early in a Game 3 loss to the Raptors as Curry carried an offense playing without star forward Durant, who was out because of an Achilles injury. While he couldn't carry the Warriors to a victory, Curry hit six 3-pointers and scored 47 points, giving Warriors fans one last show in Oracle Arena before the team moved to Chase Center after the season. While Curry's performance was a highlight for the Warriors, this series will always be remembered by Durant's Achilles tear in Game 5 and Klay Thompson's ACL tear in Game 6.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n15. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns | Game score: 37.0\n\n1993 Finals: Game 2 vs. Chicago Bulls\n\nAfter a subpar Game 1, where he posted 21 points on 9-of-25 shooting as the Bulls won the opener in Phoenix, Barkley bounced back with his best game of the 1993 Finals: 42 points on 16-of-26 shooting, plus 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Only one problem: Jordan also scored 42 points, coming within an assist of a triple-double. While Barkley got the edge in game score by virtue of his efficiency, Jordan's Chicago team earned the 111-108 win, taking a 2-0 lead in a series they would go on to win in six games.\n\n-- Pelton\n\nThe best of the rest\n\n16. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls, 1992 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 36.9\n17. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks, 2021 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 36.7\n18. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers, 2017 Finals Game 5 | Game score: 36.2\n19. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors, 2016 Finals Game 7 | Game score: 35.9\n20. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns, 1993 Finals Game 4 | Game score: 35.6\n21. Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers, 2001 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 35.0\n22. Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers, 1987 Finals Game 3 | Game score: 35.0\n23. Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers, 2002 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 35.0\n24. James Worthy, Los Angeles Lakers, 1988 Finals Game 4 | Game score: 35.0\n25. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls, 1991 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 34.7\n\n"

          "raw_content": "NBA\n\nLeBron James and the Most Versatile NBA Stars of All Time\n\nIt's no coincidence that LeBron James followed up an MVP-worthy regular season with his first NBA title and second Olympic gold medal.\n\nHe's able to lead his teams to greatness thanks in large part to the wide variety of contributions he makes to those teams. Whereas most clubs are happy just to have an elite scorer and some competent role players, James is like a Swiss Army knife.\n\nNo matter the need at hand, there's almost certainly some way he can help.\n\nHe wasn't the first such player, and he won't be the last. He's just the very best the NBA has to offer at this moment in time.\n\nHere's a look at the 15 most versatile NBA stars of all time, including man-of-the-hour (if not man-of-the-decade) LeBron James.\n\nAlong with Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor was one of the very first players to do a little bit of everything extremely well.\n\nAt just 6'5\", Baylor was a mind-boggling good rebounder for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. He had a Dennis Rodman-like nose for the ball, and he was a couple of inches shorter.\n\nBaylor also found a few opportunities to pass the ball. Despite averaging 27.4 points for his career, he also notched 4.3 assists. The forward brought a new brand of athleticism to the game that allowed him to play on the wing while also mixing it up in the paint.\n\nHow he'd fair in today's NBA is anyone's guess, but there's little doubt that today's NBA wouldn't look the same without this kind of predecessor.\n\nYou can't put this list together without including the league's all-time leader in triple-doubles, Oscar Robertson.\n\nEarly in his career, Robertson was a triple-double waiting to happen. In fact, he became the only player in league history to average one in 1961-62 with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and a league-leading 11.4 assists. That just doesn't happen anymore, and it's hard to imagine even LeBron James accomplishing something like that.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the NBA of the early '60s isn't what it is today.\n\nBut, that shouldn't diminish how much Robertson did for the game. The 6'5\" guard was the godfather of versatility.\n\nThere are plenty arguments to be made for why guys like Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were more dominant big men, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played the game at a level that most centers before or since could never hope to match.\n\nThe 7'2\" giant was always an elite scorer, but he was also a dominant rebounder and skilled passer during his prime years.\n\nIn his first season with the Los Angeles Lakers, he averaged 27.7 points, 16.8 rebounds, five assists and 4.1 blocks.\n\nWhile his opposition may not have been as stiff as what the average center has to face these days, there's still no question this guy was an incredibly gifted talent capable of impacting the game in a lot of ways.\n\nHe also brought a measure of finesse to the position that simply eludes most seven-footers at a basic level. From his scoring ability to his defensive impact, Kareem was one of the first big men to truly do it all.\n\nYou probably remember Julius Erving for his iconic highlights, but Dr. J was far more than a slam-dunk artist.\n\nThough Erving was never much of a long-range threat, he was a prolific scorer thanks to his ability to do just about anything he wanted in the painted area. He could seamlessly glide into the paint, and he knew what to do once he got there.\n\nBut, Erving was also a well-rounded swingman, often averaging over six or seven rebounds a game along with three or four assists.\n\nThe length and athleticism that has come to define the NBA wing owes much to the 6'6\" Erving. He proved that you can spend time in the backcourt while still making a significant impact in the paint.\n\nNo, Larry Bird didn't have the quickest feet this game's every seen, but he found plenty of ways to make up for it.\n\nIn addition to emerging as one of the NBA's very best shooters in the 1980s, Bird also averaged 10 rebounds per contest thanks to his 6'9\" size and excellent anticipation. Always physical and quick to the ball, Bird wasn't your typical jump-shooter.\n\nNor was he simply an earlier copy of Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nThis guy was also an outstanding passer, averaging 6.3 assists for his career and making the most of cohorts like Kevin McHale and Robert Parish.\n\nBird could play either forward position, and he in many ways exemplifies the \"spread-4\" concept increasingly relied upon to space the floor in today's half-court offenses.\n\nThere haven't been many triple-double machines like Magic Johnson, and it's no surprise why.\n\nAt 6'9\" Johnson gave the Los Angeles Lakers plenty of size. As one of the best passers the game's ever seen, he also gave them a floor general who could make the most of weapons like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.\n\nFor his career, Johnson averaged 19.5 points, 11.2 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals.\n\nThe NBA wasn't used to a man that size having such quick hands and feet, and it showed. Though LeBron James inherited a lot from Dr. J's above-the-rim game, he owes just as much if not more to Magic's incredible play-making skills.\n\nWith the careers of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson coming to an end, Scottie Pippen quite simply redefined versatility for the next generation.\n\nHe popularized the notion of the \"point-forward\" thanks to his length and uncanny passing ability. With point guards like John Paxson and B.J. Armstrong so adept at spotting up for perimeter buckets, running the offense often became Pippen's responsibility.\n\nBut, for all his contributions to the Chicago Bulls' triangle offense, Pippen was also one of the NBA's very best defenders. He could effectively guard anyone on the wing and could hold his own against more than a few 4s.\n\nFrom Tracy McGrady to LeBron James, many of the league's best forwards have Pippen to thank for expanding what it really means to be a forward.\n\nClyde Drexler's career line says it all.\n\nHe averaged 20.4 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.6 assists in 1,086 regular-season games. He averaged as many as 7.9 rebounds (in 1988-89) and eight assists (in 1985-86). As point guard Terry Porter came into the picture, Drexler became more of a pure scorer, but he continued to do a little bit of everything for the eternally underrated Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nDrexler never got the recognition he deserved on account of that MJ guy, but he remained the Western Conference's most well-rounded shooting guard for a good five or six years.\n\nNo, he didn't play four different positions, and Scottie Pippen usually gets all the attention as the \"versatile\" one, but Michael Jordan makes a case on a couple of different levels.\n\nAs arguably the most gifted scorer the game has ever seen, MJ did his damage in a number of different ways. He's as dangerous as anyone on the wing, either facing the basket or posting up. The range of moves at his disposal in either instance was too mind-boggling for merely mortal defenders to anticipate.\n\nJordan could also score from the perimeter or exploit opportunities off the ball, cutting to the basket or coming off screens for quick jumpers. His jumper was unguardable, and his ability to finish in the paint was equally problematic.\n\nWe all know what he did on the fast break.\n\nAnd yet, for all the different ways he could score the ball, Jordan was also an elite defender, an excellent passer and a constant presence on the glass.\n\nHe may have done it all from the shooting guard spot, but that doesn't make him any less versatile.\n\nChris Webber will forever be remembered for all the wrong things, but he was one of the game's best power forwards in his day.\n\nDuring his finest seasons with the Sacramento Kings, we were reminded that big men can indeed pass the ball thanks to the opportunities he found in Rick Adelman's Princeton offense. Webber worked wonders from the high-post, passing to cutters and shooting an automatic jumper in equal proportion.\n\nHe averaged 4.2 assists for his career.\n\nWebber was also an underrated defender. He used his soft hands to rack up plenty of steals and blocks, and he notched 9.7 rebounds per game for his career.\n\nFew have aged as gracefully as Grant Hill, but this guy was one of the league's very best players in his prime.\n\nIn his third season, the small forward averaged 21.4 points, nine rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals. At various points in his career, Hill's also guarded both forward positions along with some shooting guards, and done a first-rate job of it.\n\nIn his younger years, he also took on ball-handling and facilitating responsibilities. Hill looked to be one of the league's next greats until injuries derailed his stint with the Orlando Magic.\n\nHill's managed a successful reemergence, but it's been a long time since he did it all as the Detroit Pistons' breakout franchise player.\n\nIf Kevin Garnett weren't such a beast inside the paint, he very well could have played the 3 position earlier in his career.\n\nHe has the length of a center, the interior explosiveness of a power forward and the perimeter ability of a small forward. His jumper from the high post is one of the most automatic in the game, but his moves in the post are just as dangerous.\n\nIn 2002-03, arguably his best all-around season, KG averaged 23 points, 13.5 rebounds, six assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.4 steals.\n\nThere have always been better scorers and more dominant big men, but there's never been someone quite like Garnett.\n\nOh yeah, he's also one heck of a tough guy who's just as much of a leader in the locker room as he is on the floor.\n\nAfter Tracy McGrady's career was decimated by injury, it's easy to forget just how good the 33-year-old was in his prime years.\n\nHe averaged as many as 32.1 points per game in 2002-03 and regularly posted over five assists and six rebounds a contest, reaching careers-highs of 6.5 and 7.9, respectively. At his best, T-Mac was a spitting image of Scottie Pippen, only with even better scoring instincts.\n\nThe 6'8\" forward used his smooth athleticism to glide around the floor and make plays from anywhere.\n\nGiven just how good he was with the ball in his hands, McGrady turned the point-forward role into an art and made everything he did look awfully good.\n\nEven with a scaled down role, today's T-Mac remains a veteran capable of making a wide range of contributions. But, it's safe to say we'll never see him do the things he did in his early 20s with the Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets.\n\nThough he's never been a very strong defender and hasn't been a stranger to that dreaded \"soft\" label, Dirk Nowitzki still deserves some consideration on this list.\n\nHe's always been a good rebounder and a better passer than most men his size, but one ability in particular has qualitatively set him apart from his peers. Dirk is almost certainly the best shooter out of any seven-footer to have played the game.\n\nYou might not think much of a big man shooting over 47 percent from the field for his career. But, when that big man was shooting jump shots, it's a different story.\n\nFrom behind the arc, Dirk's career mark is a similarly impressive 38 percent.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Nowitzki showcases a wide array of moves to free himself from even the best defenders. He can turn around, fall away and pump-fake his way to open shots whether in the post or on the wing.\n\nIn so many ways, LeBron James is the culmination of all the versatile players to come before him, the actualization of the league's best players spending decades trying to do more than the guys that came before them.\n\nLBJ is well-rounded in every possible sense.\n\nHe produces in multiple ways, plays hard on both ends of the floor and can guard virtually any position on the floor. At 6'8\" and 250 lbs, he has an unrivaled frame, but he also has the kind of uncanny athleticism you'd expect from a smaller guard.\n\nThrough the first nine years of his career, James has averaged 27.1 points, 6.2 assists and 7.9 rebounds.\n\nMore impressively, though, LeBron exerts his will defensively on the perimeter and in the post alike. Few players have taken it upon themselves to alter games in so many different ways, and few players deserve their MVPs as much as this guy.\n\n"

Heâs a cultural icon, a business mogul, and one of the most influential athletes of his time. From his early life challenges to his rise in the NBA, to building a brand empire that spans sports, entertainment, and education, LeBronâs journey reflects his work ethic, focus, and strategic thinking.\n\nEarly Life and Basketball Roots\n\nLeBron Raymone James Sr. was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. Raised by a single mother, Gloria James, he faced poverty and instability but found stability in basketball. By the time he reached high school at St. Vincent-St. Mary, LeBron was recognized nationwide as a top basketball prospect. His unique combination of size, speed, and basketball IQ set him apart.\n\nâ\n\nLeBron entered the NBA directly from high school, skipping college, a rare path chosen by only a few players. He was selected first overall in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and he quickly showed he could compete with the leagueâs best.\n\nLeBron James has transcended basketball to become a globally recognized cultural icon. From his standout career on the court to his strategic business moves, social activism, and philanthropic efforts, LeBron's influence reaches across sports, business, and social landscapes. This blog explores LeBronâs legacy, his impact on basketball, his groundbreaking influence in business, and his contributions to social causes.\n\nBasketball Career: Setting New Standards of Excellence\n\nLeBron James' impact on basketball is unparalleled. Known for his versatility, athleticism, and basketball IQ, he redefined what it means to be an NBA player. Hereâs how heâs changed the game:\n\nInfluence on the NBA Business Model\n\nLeBron has also had a significant impact on how players manage their careers, negotiate contracts, and leverage their brand power.\n\nBrand Deals and Business Empire\n\nLeBron has turned his status as a top athlete into a business empire, generating income and building a lasting legacy through strategic brand partnerships and investments.\n\nMajor Endorsements\n\nLeBronâs partnerships with brands like Nike, Pepsi, and Beats by Dre have made him one of the highest-paid athletes in endorsements.\n\nMedia Ventures with SpringHill Company\n\nLeBronâs SpringHill Company has become a major force in media production, producing content that amplifies stories in sports, entertainment, and social issues.\n\nThe LeBron Factor: Redefining Athlete Marketing\n\nLeBron James' approach to marketing has set him apart as one of the most influential athletes in history. Known as âThe LeBron Factor,â his strategy centers around authenticity, engagement, and social impact, qualities that have made him a powerful brand in his own right.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James: Analyzing What Makes Him the Most Versatile Player in NBA History\n\nNow that LeBron James can add the title \"NBA champion\" to his resume, it's time to examine where James fits among the NBA's all-time greats.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that James was making noise (and history) in the Ohio High School Athletic Association. When James was just 16 years old, Ryan Jones of Slam Magazine said the then-sophomore might be \"the best high school basketball player in America.\"\n\nGrant Wahl of Sports Illustrated noted the high level of praise NBA scouts doled on James as a high-school junior who already impressed with his all-around game.\n\nHeaping that much praise on a high schooler often can be disastrous.\n\nAnd James' admirers had set the bar higher than that for any high-school player before or since.\n\nDubbed \"King James,\" he was also dubbed Jordan's heir apparent before he had even left the campus of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio.\n\nThere was no way that this child (not even a 6'7\", 225-pound man-child) could ever live up to this level of buzz, right?\n\nWell, not exactly...\n\nFast forward to 2012, and James is now unquestionably the best player on the planet. Basketball minds are still raving about his versatility, and those Jordan comparisons still resonate.\n\nYet it's hard to say that James has lived up to the \"next Jordan\" moniker.\n\nHe's simply the first LeBron James.\n\nTruth be told, James has drawn more comparisons to Magic Johnson than Jordan, but even those fail to capture the immense talent of the King.\n\nThe Johnson-James comparisons draw from a reasonable origin: Both players are 6'8\" or taller with the handles, court vision and decision-making to play the point-guard position.\n\nBut as great as Johnson was, he was never the scorer nor the defender that James is.\n\nJohnson topped the 20-point mark just four seasons in his career (his best scoring year came when he averaged 23.9 in 1986-87), while James has topped it in each of his nine seasons and has even topped the 30-point plateau in two different seasons.\n\nAs for the defensive comparisons, Johnson was lauded as a smart team defender. But he never made an all-defensive team in his NBA career.\n\nJames, meanwhile, has appeared on the past four all-defensive first teams and realistically should have an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award by now (the only piece of NBA hardware still evading the 27-year-old).\n\nWait, James can score and defend? Maybe those Jordan comparisons aren't too off base.\n\nIn terms of raw talent and importance to their teams, the comparisons are warranted.\n\nBut the two played vastly different games.\n\nJordan was every bit the athletic specimen then that James is today, but he was not initiating former Bulls coach Phil Jackson's offense. Jordan has the edge in career scoring (30.1 to 27.6), while James has the advantage in assists (6.9 to 5.3).\n\nLikewise, while Jordan could defend anyone on the perimeter, he simply didn't have the size to defend the bigs of his era on a nightly basis.\n\nJames is simply unlike anyone player the game has seen.\n\nWith his combination of size, strength, intelligence and athleticism, he can do everything on the basketball court.\n\nSports fans love to compare players across eras in order to \"decide\" who was the greatest or who will be the next so-and-so.\n\nBut basketball fans would be much better with that sliver of hope in searching for the next Jordan. Because there will never be another King James.\n\n"

He was the one who was supposed to take over from Michael Jordan and hence was given the nickname \"King James\". From being the cover athlete of Sports Illustrated while still in high school to becoming a 4 time NBA Champion and then going on to lead with his voice on topics of social justice. Amongst many achievements and accolades James has earned on the NBA court, his greatest moment came quite possibly in March 2024 when he became the one and only player to date to ever eclipse the 40,000 mark in career points. He is the greatest success story in the league's history.\n \nMichael Jordan was the pioneer who led the NBA to the global stage back in the 90s. The heights of global fame and stardom that he achieved put him in such rare air that he is still to this day considered the greatest athlete of all time. He relentlessly pursued greatness and won 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls. After retiring he went on to become a business tycoon amassing a huge amount of wealth. A few years later he bought the Charlotte Hornets and became the first-ever American athlete to do so.\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Stats\nMichael Jordan was all about taking over the game and single-handedly outplaying his opponents with his dominant game. LeBron is a more balanced player who scores when challenged to score but his game is more about getting his teammates involved, grabbing rebounds, and doing those little things that help a team get a victory.\nCareer (Averages)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPoints27.130.1Rebounds7.56.2Assists7.45.3Steals1.52.3Blocks0.70.8Turnovers3.52.7Minutes37.938.3Field goal %50.649.73-point %34.832.7Free throw %73.683.5\nCareer (Totals)LeBron JamesMichael JordanGames1,4951,072Points40,54334,241Rebounds11,2086,672Assists11,0315,633Steals2,2752,514Blocks1,114893Turnovers5,2202,924Minutes56,70041,011\n(LeBron stats as of October 2024)\n\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Advanced Stats\nWhen one is comparing two different eras, it’s not ideal to just look at the major stats.

Overall, both players rank high not only in the regular season but in the postseason as well, and once again deciding the better player between the two in the postseason is still as tough as ever. In the following table, we pit LeBron James with Michael Jordan and take a look at the advanced stats of the two in the playoffs.\nAdvanced Career Stats (Playoffs)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)28.228.6Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)33.924.7Box Plus/Minus (BPM)10.211.1Win Shares (WS)55.739.8True Shooting % (TS%)58.356.8Usage Rate (USG%)3235.6\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan NBA Finals Stats\nLeBron James has been to the finals 10 times, winning the championship on four occasions.

While Jordan does lead in most of the important categories here, James is not too far behind and can still catch up before his career is over. Therefore deciding whether MJ or LeBron is better falls short in this category as well.\nAchievementsLeBron JamesMichael JordanNBA Finals appearances106Championships46Regular season MVP45Defensive Player of the Year01Finals MVP46Rookie of the Year11Scoring titles110Assist leader10Steals leader03All-Star selections2014All NBA selections2011All-Defensive selections69\nMichael Jordan vs LeBron James Net Worth\nLeBron James over his career and through other business ventures has amassed a fortune of over $1.2 billion. Basketball is the driving force behind LeBron’s wealth; when you’ve been a top player for almost 20 years, the game checks simply add up. According to Spotrac’s financial data, James has earned an impressive total of over $430 million in salary during his time in the NBA.\nKing James’ income isn’t limited to basketball, though. Other than his massive Nike contract and game checks, the Lakers star is also quite the entrepreneur. Thanks to investments in Blaze Pizza, Beats, and Liverpool FC, among other brands.\nWhile LeBron James’ net worth is nothing to look down on, he’s still nowhere near His Airness. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan’s net worth has now reached a staggering $3 billion.\nMichael Jordan didn’t make that much in the NBA. He only commanded truly massive salaries during his last two seasons in Chicago. Jordan earned $94 million in-game checks, with roughly $63 million coming in just 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nHowever, his superstar status paid dividends. Apart from his massive contract with Nike, he endorsed everything from underwear to Gatorade and also McDonald's; those deals kept the cash flowing. In retirement, he also managed to get into an elite group by becoming an owner of an NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets.\nAlso Read: LeBron James Net Worth\nHas LeBron James ever played against Michael Jordan?\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan never got the chance to play each other on the NBA court. Unfortunately for both superstars, their careers could not overlap as Jordan had made his way out of the league just a few months before LeBron stepped foot on the NBA court.\nWhile Jordan's last game in the NBA came on April 16, 2003, LeBron's first career NBA game was on Oct. 29, 2003. For die-hard fans of the NBA, a matchup between these two legends would have been something surreal, however, it may not have accounted for much as Jordan was already past his prime having turned 40 years old while LeBron on the other hand was just a rookie in 2003.\nWho is the GOAT of the NBA?\nMichael Jordan is often considered the GOAT of the NBA. At present, Jordan is the forerunner in all accolades other than All-Star appearances, All-NBA Team, and the Hall of Fame. He has a better NBA Finals record. Furthermore, he has two rings more than LeBron James. He also has three more All-Defense selections and an additional MVP award. He also holds a Defensive Player of the Year award, an accomplishment that has eluded James. LeBron's commitment to amassing his fourth ring has brought him closer to his goal - winning six or more rings.\nHowever, Jordan was not the complete player that James was. LeBron James is the only player in NBA history with 10K points, rebounds, and assists. He is in the top 10-15 of virtually every list in the league and has also become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. James also leads the league in almost every playoff statistic, having been to the NBA Finals 10 times. He is also a much better playmaker than Jordan ever was, leading the league in assists once. He has all the stats and longevity arguments in his favor over Jordan, who was mainly valued as a scorer on the offensive end. While most people would say Michael Jordan is the Greatest player of all time. Few people like Detroit Pistons rookie Cade Cunningham believe LeBron James is the greatest player.\nWho is a better player between LeBron and Jordan?\n\nImage source: CBS Sports\nLeBron James' statistics stipulate that he is the better overall basketball player. LeBron is a more efficient player, a much better passer, and a rebounder than Jordan was. Jordan, on the flip side, has a much better free throw percentage, which sustains the points-per-game statistic. The two are relatively equivalent in efficiency ratings, with Jordan being first overall in NBA history and LeBron trailing close behind at second.\nMichael averaged more steals per game, but both players are exactly even in blocks per game. Having played so many fewer games than James, Jordan's defensive capabilities do outshine the current Lakers forward. With more All-Defensive Team selections as well as an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, the edge on that side of the ball favors the former Bulls guard. LeBron has also turned the ball over more per game as well.\nThe one thing James has in his favor are all the longevity stats and these stats will continue to stack up until he calls it a day in the NBA. Till then the gap between both players will continue to increase but then again, Jordan has already achieved so much in less time. Having said that, one of the most important records that James now possesses is leading the entire NBA in the most points ever scored.\nAfter going through everything the game has to offer, the choice between the GOAT of the NBA does come down to personal taste. Both are legends of the game who have given it their all on the court, and their statistics and records are also comparable. It is difficult to pick out any one player as the GOAT since the eras are different, the rules are different, and players play in different positions, so comparing a guard with a forward is not an ideal way of arguing who is better.\nAlso read: All about Michael Jordan’s net worth\nRead Less  \nFAQs on Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James\nQ.

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

          "raw_content": "What Questions Automatically Spark a Debate?\n\nRecently, I watched a podcast called Club Shay Shay where Shannon Sharpe (3X Super Bowl NFL champ) and Charles Barkley (former NBA power forward) debated the difference between 1990s basketball players and current NBA players. For those not into sports, hang in there.\n\nHumans love to compare. Celebrity magazines ask, “Who wore this dress better?” Smartphone users debate, “Apple or Android?” (Is there really a comparison?) With the U.S. elections approaching… well, let’s not go there! But in the podcast, the question was:\n\nWho is the better basketball player, Michael Jordan or LeBron James?\n\nI rolled my eyes, expecting Charles Barkley to glorify the good ole days of “real basketball.” He could’ve used stats or stories to stand his ground. But he didn’t.\n\nInstead, Barkley emphasized that comparing is never simple. Sure, some elements of basketball have remained the same: five players on a court playing the same positions, with the same scoring rules. Yet, much has changed. The league has grown, social media exploded, rules concerning fouls have evolved, and technology has transformed how teams use stats and rehab players.\n\nBarkley highlighted that while there’s often tension between current and former players, there’s also room for mutual learning.\n\nNow, why does this matter?\n\nI’ve been working on a passion project with a dear friend, focused on providing military field leaders with new resources during crucial roles like command. We’ve reached out to previous leaders for support, and their responses have been mixed. Some say, “I made it through command without those resources; they’ll just need to toughen up.” Others argue, “Without data proving these leaders need more, why invest further?” And then some simply ask, “What do you mean?”\n\nHere’s where I pull out my sports analogy: while former leaders navigated the same “game” of command, some variables have changed. These experienced leaders can offer invaluable advice, but they must recognize that new strategies and resources are available today.\n\nConsider this: an athlete suffers a knee injury.\n\nTen years ago, rehab primarily involved rest, basic physical therapy, and progressive strength training. Today, rehab is much more sophisticated. With advancements in sports medicine, we now have personalized, data-driven protocols, regenerative therapies like platelet-rich plasma treatments, and advanced techniques such as blood flow restriction training. Recovery now also emphasizes mental resilience and injury prevention through biomechanical assessments.\n\nSame knee injury, but drastically different approaches. A current athlete can still learn from a retired one about mental toughness and discipline, but why would they rely on outdated rehab techniques?\n\nLikewise, I’m challenged daily in our ever-changing world to reflect on how I approach problems. Am I open to evolving? I went to school for 8 hours a day—do my children need to? I once did ____ to achieve success, but is there a better method now?\n\nThe truth is, asking “Who is better?”—especially when comparing across generations—might be fun, but it’s not necessarily productive. A more useful approach might be to ask:\n\n• What new developments in my industry could benefit the next generation?\n\n• How can previous experiences inform current challenges, without resisting modern innovations?\n\n• What mindset shifts must I embrace to stay relevant and impactful?\n\n\n\nUltimately, growth happens when we stop clinging to the past and start combining its wisdom with the innovations of the present.\n\nWith Love,\n\nLiz\n\n\n\nThe Heart Behind Buffalo & Banyan\n\nAdult Learning\n\nCheck out our Handles\n\nBUFFALO AND BANYAN\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn commissions from qualifying purchases.

          "raw_content": "Jordan vs. LeBron\n\nWhat's the Difference?\n\nJordan and LeBron are two of the greatest basketball players of all time, each leaving a lasting impact on the game. Jordan is known for his killer instinct, clutch performances, and six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. LeBron, on the other hand, is known for his versatility, basketball IQ, and ability to elevate his teammates. While Jordan is often considered the greatest of all time, LeBron's longevity and consistency have solidified his place in the GOAT conversation as well. Both players have redefined the game in their own ways and will forever be remembered as legends of the sport.\n\nComparison\n\nAttribute | Jordan | LeBron\nChampionships | 6 | 4\nScoring Titles | 10 | 1\nRegular Season MVPs | 5 | 4\nFinals MVPs | 6 | 4\nAll-Star Appearances | 14 | 17\nFurther Detail\n\nScoring Ability\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. His ability to score from anywhere on the court, whether it be driving to the basket, hitting mid-range jumpers, or sinking three-pointers, made him a nightmare for defenders. Jordan's scoring prowess was highlighted by his six NBA scoring titles and ten scoring titles in the playoffs. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility as a scorer. While he may not have the same killer instinct as Jordan, LeBron is able to score in a variety of ways, using his size and strength to overpower defenders in the paint or his shooting touch to knock down shots from beyond the arc.\n\nDefense\n\nWhen it comes to defense, Michael Jordan was a tenacious and lockdown defender. His ability to disrupt passing lanes, block shots, and shut down opposing players made him a nine-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. Jordan's defensive prowess was also highlighted by his 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year award. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility on the defensive end. While he may not have the same defensive accolades as Jordan, LeBron is able to guard multiple positions and make game-changing plays on defense, such as chase-down blocks and steals in crucial moments.\n\nLeadership\n\nMichael Jordan was known for his fierce competitiveness and his ability to lead his team to victory. His leadership on the court was evident in his six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, where he was named NBA Finals MVP in all six appearances. Jordan's will to win and his ability to elevate his teammates made him one of the greatest leaders in NBA history. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his leadership both on and off the court. LeBron has led multiple teams to NBA championships and has been praised for his ability to empower his teammates and make everyone around him better. His leadership style is more inclusive and collaborative compared to Jordan's more demanding and intense approach.\n\nClutch Factor\n\nWhen it comes to clutch performances, Michael Jordan is often considered the greatest of all time. His ability to rise to the occasion in crucial moments, such as hitting game-winning shots in the playoffs, earned him the nickname \"The Clutch Man.\" Jordan's killer instinct and confidence in high-pressure situations made him a feared opponent in clutch moments. LeBron James, on the other hand, has also had his fair share of clutch moments throughout his career. While he may not have the same number of game-winning shots as Jordan, LeBron has shown time and time again that he can deliver in clutch situations, whether it be scoring the final points or making a crucial defensive stop.\n\nLegacy\n\nMichael Jordan's legacy in the NBA is unparalleled. His six NBA championships, five NBA MVP awards, and numerous scoring titles solidify his place as one of the greatest players of all time. Jordan's impact on the game of basketball goes beyond his on-court accomplishments, as he helped popularize the sport globally and became a cultural icon. LeBron James, on the other hand, is still building his legacy in the NBA. With multiple NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, and countless All-Star selections, LeBron has already cemented his place among the all-time greats. His impact on and off the court has made him a role model for aspiring basketball players and a respected figure in the sports world.\n\nComparisons may contain inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James and Michael Jordan became the NBA's greatest players with a leadership style that differed in a key way\n\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan have both achieved success at the highest levels in the NBA, and their methods of getting their haven't been entirely different.\n\nAs covered in ESPN's docuseries \"The Last Dance\" on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, Jordan could be a ruthless leader. Teammates admitted to fearing Jordan, who would trash-talk, belittle, and criticize players to motivate them.\n\nJames is known as a tireless worker, like Jordan, who can be hard on teammates but generally uses a kinder, more positive method off the court to get there.\n\nJordan tested teammates while James forges bonds\n\nThe stories of Jordan's intensity have become legendary. Insider spoke to NBA agent B.J. Armstrong, who played with Jordan and the Bulls from 1989 to 1995, and asked whether Jordan was as intense as has been depicted.\n\n\"Was he like that every day? Yes,\" said Armstrong. \"He was like that every day.\"\n\nSteve Kerr, who played with Jordan during the Bulls' second \"three-peat\" from 1995 to 1998, told Bill Simmons that Jordan's philosophy was to harden players to prepare them for the biggest moments.\n\n\"You knew he was going to be harsh on you. You knew he was going to be tough on you, was going to talk trash to everybody in practice, test you,\" Kerr said. \"And his reasoning was: If you couldn't handle the trash talk in practice, there's no way you could handle the pressure of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"It made perfect sense. He was right!\"\n\nMeanwhile, James' philosophy has been to befriend teammates off the floor so that they know his on-court critiques aren't personal, former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson told ESPN in 2017.\n\n\"I think LeBron, being such a good teammate, understands the aspect of, 'The more I can have a personal relationship with guys, the more I can get on them, the more I can pull from them, and the more I can expect from them. And they'll know that it's never just about me,'\" Jefferson said.\n\nHe said James goes above and beyond to keep teammates together off the court and strengthen relationships.\n\n\"The amount of time he spends being great with lifting and shooting and training, he is as equal when it comes to spending time trying to be a good teammate,\" Jefferson said. \"Having people over to his house for dinner, throwing a Christmas party or a Halloween party, having guys orchestrating a dinner here or a movie night here. He spends as much time trying to be great on the court as he does trying to make sure that the team is a cohesive unit off the court.\"\n\nJordan and James earned their stripes by out-working everyone\n\nArmstrong told Insider that Jordan's methods of leadership worked because Jordan worked harder than everybody else.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be the leader, but the only way you can lead is, the people got to follow,\" Armstrong said. \"There has to be some relationship there. That's what made him special. He wasn't going to ask you to do anything that he wasn't willing to do himself.\n\nArmstrong added: \"No one can deny one thing: he only wanted to win. He didn't have another agenda.\"\n\nIn \"The Last Dance,\" Jordan addressed his reputation for being tough on teammates. Jordan said his teammates could never say that he asked them to do something he wouldn't do himself. As Jordan spoke, a clip played of him beating other Bulls players in wind sprints.\n\n\"That man was 30-something-years old, still winning the drills!\" Armstrong said. \"You understand what I'm saying? The level of conditioning — look, when you get to be that age, I don't think the coaches or anybody are expecting you to still win the drills. He's not only winning the drills. He's talking trash to everybody. So this is what I'm saying — he's not asking you, he's not saying, 'Do as I say and not as I do.' No. 'I'm doing this.'\"\n\nJefferson said James' work ethic in training was unparalleled.\n\n\"His approach to the game — a lot of people don't see how hard he works,\" Jefferson said. \"Being in the weight room, the training regimen that he has — I've never seen it. I can honestly say that.\"\n\nFormer Cavs teammate Iman Shumpert told Complex in 2017 that James puts his training and body care above everything else.\n\n\"He just takes care of his body,\" Shumpert said. \"He's got his trainers there. He put that ice on right after the game — he gonna sit there.\n\n\"Like, people may think it's diva-ish, but that man will get his treatment and be late. 'I'll be late to this event, even though y'all paid me all this money to be here. Because I gotta do everything I gotta do to make sure I preserve my body so I can do this tomorrow.'\"\n\nJames told Business Insider in 2016 that he believed he had to set an example for teammates by putting in the work himself.\n\n\"I don't just talk about it — I actually do it as well,\" James said. \"When you're able to come through on your word, it allows the guys that you're leading, male or female, to be able to say, 'OK. We can follow this person because he won't let us down. No matter if it's going good or bad.'\"\n\nWhat were they like off the court?\n\nTraining and basketball is only part of the equation. NBA players spend a lot of time off the court together, and that relationship can matter to team success.\n\nAs Jefferson said, James puts in extra effort to throwing parties and team outings to keep players close to one another.\n\nAnthony Davis, who was traded to the Lakers in the summer of 2019, told The Athletic that James is like a kid off the court, always having fun, setting up events, and making teammates laugh.\n\n\"You wouldn't know it unless you're his teammate or you're around him a lot, but he's a big kid,\" Davis said. \"He's high on life, loves life, lives his life to the fullest. I get to see that every day. Win, lose or draw, he's got a smile on his face ... He's always setting up team dinners. He's about the team, and he's always making us laugh.\"\n\nThough James' efforts to be friendly to teammates have received praise, Armstrong cautioned about drawing a straight line between team success and off-court friendship.\n\n\"We didn't have to hang out,\" Armstrong said of his Bulls teams. \"Not that we didn't hang out, you know, we were a very close group. But just because you hang out doesn't necessarily mean that that's a close team or close group or what have you.\"\n\nArmstrong said Jordan wasn't the type to organize team dinners or group outings like James does. However, Armstrong said the Bulls teams were full of \"truth-tellers\" — a necessary component to a successful team.\n\n\"You have to tell each other your truth because if you don't, then there is something missing where you don't feel comfortable, or that other person doesn't feel comfortable with you,\" Armstrong said.\n\nStill, Armstrong said Jordan was \"one of the guys.\"\n\nArmstrong also said Jordan had a way of making anyone he met feel like a close friend.\n\n\"He has this incredible gift where he can make you feel like he's known you his entire life,\" Armstrong said. \"Like, he just has it. He has that charisma about him that he just understands people. I don't know if that was natural or he worked on it. I have no idea, but I just knew he was always aware of what was going on around him … He relished in that. He enjoyed it.\"\n\nArmstrong added that Jordan is also very funny, with a sharp sense of humor.\n\n\"He loves being one of the guys. He loves it. That's the side that I know. I'll always remember, like, the bus rides and plane rides and all of the things like that, because he's really funny.\"\n\nDownfalls to their leadership styles?\n\nJordan and James' high expectations could also make it challenging to play with them.\n\nKerr told Simmons that at times it felt like he was playing for Jordan, rather than with him.\n\nJordan has also been accused of alienating teammates. Former Bulls forward Horace Grant has said he and Jordan were not particularly close off the floor.\n\nSam Smith, the author of the famed book \"Jordan Rules,\" recently said on a KNBR podcast that Bulls players used to tell him that Jordan would deny Grant food after bad games.\n\n\"Players would come to me over the years and said, 'You know what he did? He took Horace [Grant's] food away on the plane because Horace had a bad game.' [Michael] told the stewardesses, 'Don't feed him, he doesn't deserve to eat,'\" Smith said.\n\nFormer Bulls assistant coach Tex Winter told Michael Leahy in the 2004 book \"When Nothing Else Matters,\" that Jordan could be too tough on teammates and that those methods didn't always pay off. Winter said some teammates \"resented\" the way Jordan treated them (via CBS's James Herbert).\n\nJames has also been accused of alienating teammates. In the 2018-19 season, his first with the Lakers, James was criticized for distancing himself from his younger teammates. During a bad loss to the Indiana Pacers, James was seen sitting several seats away from his teammates, many of whom were in trade rumors.\n\nESPN's Dave McMenamin reported in 2019 that Lakers players even called James out for his poor body language that season.\n\n\"[James] copped to the critique, telling his teammates that, in essence, cutting out behavior like slumped shoulders and sideways glances has been something he has tried to work on his entire career,\" McMenamin wrote.\n\nTeammates would go to battle with Jordan and James all over again\n\nThough neither are perfect in their leadership habits, many players have come away impressed by how both players approached the game.\n\nJefferson said James' willingness to shoulder the burden of leading the team impressed him.\n\n\"Not many people in the history of sports have said, 'Everyone get on my back,'\" Jefferson told ESPN. \"The city, state, organization, team … 'Get on my back. If we win or fail, I'll take the blame — but I'm going to lead you.'\n\n\"How many people have ever said that? I can't think of too many players who have put that type of pressure on themselves and then have delivered more times than not. And he embraces it.\"\n\nKyrie Irving, who later requested a trade from the Cavs to get out from under James' shadow, said after the 2017 Finals that learning from James changed his career.\n\n\"Man, he's freaking awesome,\" Irving told reporters. \"As a student of the game, it would be a disservice to myself if I didn't try to learn as much as possible while I'm playing with this guy. Every single day demanding more out of himself, demanding more out of us, the true testament of a consummate professional.\"\n\nIrving added: \"That's the type of guy that I want to be with every single time I'm going to war, because I know what to expect, and you stand your ground, too, with a leader like that.\"\n\nSimilarly, Armstrong marveled at the way Jordan rose to the occasion.\n\n\"You had no doubt that when he fell down, he was going to get back up,\" Armstrong said. \"And that was the thing that I admired most about him is every single thing he did. He was going to try his absolute best.\n\n\"How many people can say that? ... That was the lesson that I picked up very quickly from him, is I can try to be my very best every single time I do something, whatever the outcome is, I can live with the outcome. But what I can't live with is not doing my very best.\"\n\nRecommended video\n\nRead next\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nJump to\n\n"

          "raw_content": "POPULAR SEARCHES\n\nBROWSE BY\n\nOld School vs. New School: How Jordan's and LeBron's leadership styles differ\n\nBy Melissa RohlinFOX Sports NBA reporter\n\nMichael Jordan and LeBron James have a lot in common.\n\nThey're two of the greatest basketball players of all time. They revolutionized the game. They inspired everyone around them.\n\nBut the ways they went about that differ tremendously.\n\nWhile Jordan was a ruthless leader, James has a gentler approach, often befriending his teammates and learning how to get through to them.\n\nScott Williams is one of four players who played alongside both, winning three championships with Jordan on the Chicago Bulls from 1990 to '93 and spending one season with James on the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2004-05.\n\nWilliams describes Jordan as having only one gear.\n\n\"I had him before he had a ring, so it was crazy intense, like scary intense,\" Williams told FOX Sports. \"It was almost an illness how hard he went at everything, including teammates, verbally and physically.\n\n\"Going to Bulls practices was similar to going to war. You're going to get hurt. And if you don't give your all at every moment, you're not going to survive.\"\n\nJordan wanted to play alongside guys who operated at a feverish pitch. If a player fell short of his lofty expectations, he wouldn't necessarily go to management and request the player be traded, but Jordan would make the player's life miserable on the court through a combination of verbal and physical assaults, leaving management no choice but to deal the player to another team.\n\nWilliams witnessed that phenomenon firsthand.\n\n\"One of the saddest things I ever saw in my pro career was watching him go against Dennis Hopson every day,\" Williams said of the shooting guard/small forward who played for the Bulls in 1990-91 before being traded after two games the following season. \"Hop was a good guy, but Hop was about the cars and the lifestyle and the parties and the girls. And Michael wasn't having any of that. He went at him so hard every day, Hop was a shell of himself by the time the season was over. They had to trade him.\"\n\nWilliams, who was undrafted out of the University of North Carolina in 1990, earned Jordan's respect with his work ethic and willingness to stand up to him.\n\nThey'd often play one-on-one after practice because Jordan, who was 6-foot-6, wanted to improve his low-post scoring game against taller defenders. After marathon practices, the 6-foot-10 Williams would spend hours exchanging trash talk and banging elbows and hips with the best player in the world, quickly learning their relationship worked only if he returned Jordan's physicality with forearm shivers of his own.\n\nThose matchups made Williams quicker and improved his instincts, and he had an enduring, 15-season professional career as a journeyman with the Bulls, Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Cavaliers.\n\nWilliams, who is now a color analyst for the Grand Canyon Antelope men's basketball team, said playing with Jordan wasn't always fun. But every June, he felt as though all of the blood, sweat, tears, bruises and loose teeth were worth it.\n\nAnd he said it prepared him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the result of when you survive stuff like that, you realize that anything else in life is easy,\" he said. \"Anything else after that is just easier. There's nothing else I've ever faced in life where I've thought, 'Wow, this is hard work.'\"\n\nJames has a very different modus operandi.\n\nWhile Jordan had only one mode, James has many. He's vocal but can communicate just as effectively with silence or body language. He can be positive and supportive. Other times, he screams and voices his frustration. He picks and chooses when he approaches guys, sometimes opting to do so on the court in front of other players and other times over private dinners.\n\nJames tailors his approach to the specific player.\n\nTo Lakers forward Jared Dudley, a 14-year veteran who has played alongside Steve Nash, Grant Hill, Chris Paul and Shaquille O'Neal, James' leadership style is different than anybody else's.\n\nJames, Dudley says, inspires players to work harder.\n\n\"LeBron is very unique where he's a guy's guy,\" Dudley said. \"He'll drink some wine with you. He'll have a one-on-one talk with you. And guys have looked up to him for a long time. So his words of encouragement, he knows what to say at the right time. He knows when to get on you.\n\n\"Let's be real, when you see LeBron's body language, it isn't high when he's frustrated or mad. And they know that. In a way, you want to play well for him, play well for yourself, because you know how [much work] he puts into his craft. You see what he does. You don't want to let him, yourself and [the] Lakers down.\"\n\nSince James joined the Lakers in free agency in 2018, he has promoted a feeling of inclusivity and acceptance in the locker room. He invited his teammates to his 35th birthday party in West Hollywood last season. He mentored reserve guard Quinn Cook. He made former Laker Dwight Howard feel at home in a locker room that was hostile to him seven years earlier. He has hosted Lakers superstar Anthony Davis for dinners at his home with his family.\n\nJames' leadership was pivotal to the Lakers' success last season, especially for Davis.\n\nDavis, who had never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, can be hard on himself. He's a perfectionist who can sink into a funk when he isn't playing up to his standards.\n\nJames learned to read Davis' body language and determine whether he needed a pep talk or space in those moments. When the timing was right, James would urge Davis to move forward and stop dwelling on the past.\n\nDavis said it made a huge difference for him.\n\n\"He’s like a bigger brother to me and helped me with things I need help with, on and off the floor,\" Davis said. \"So it’s been great to have him around and being able to call, text him whenever I need more support on anything, mainly on just trying to figure out everything. So it's been good just having him around. If he see things, he helps me. And if I have questions about anything, he’s always there picking up his phone or responding to a text to help me out.\"\n\nThat's not to say James isn't intense.\n\nJames has had yelling matches on the court with teammates. Earlier in his career, he sometimes used social media to send cryptic messages, famously tweeting in 2015, \"Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT and just FIT-IN,\" a note he later acknowledged was directed at his former Cavaliers teammate Kevin Love, among others.\n\nAt this stage of James' career, however, there's one thing that stands out to Lakers coach Frank Vogel: his approachability.\n\nIn the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida, where the Lakers spent nearly 100 days before winning their 17th NBA championship last fall, Vogel marveled at how accessible James made himself.\n\n\"On a regular basis, he’s down there eating with his teammates and being with his teammates, which is something you don’t always say about players of his caliber,\" Vogel said. \"I can’t say enough positive things about him as a leader and what he means to our franchise.\"\n\nJames' leadership style has changed throughout the years. When he entered the league at age 18 as the No. 1 pick by the Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA Draft, his approach was to observe what leadership traits worked best.\n\n\"You come into a professional league, you sit there, and you watch,\" James said. \"You become a sponge, and you see. You lead by example, you go out, and you practice hard and stick your head into film and try to get better every single day and just try to keep quiet because there are vets and things of that nature. You've got your coaching staff that does a lot of the talking. I was more of a sponge at 18, just watching, seeing.\"\n\nWilliams played with James during his second season in the NBA and was immediately impressed by his approach.\n\nJames befriended his older teammates, playing cards with them on flights. He asked Williams questions about Jordan and the Bulls, something other young players — perhaps surprisingly — failed to do. And he demonstrated an indefatigable work ethic.\n\n\"The kid worked hard,\" Williams said. \"He was a gym rat, whether it be in the weight room getting strong, which he was already pretty darn strong as a 19-year-old, but working on his outside shooting, his footwork. I think he wanted to show the guys that I'm here every day giving it my all. I expect everybody to do the same. So it wasn't so much what he talked about, it was what he demonstrated.\"\n\nJames became much more vocal over his next few years in the league, a transformation Williams witnessed after retiring in 2004 and becoming a color analyst for the Cavaliers who often attended team practices.\n\nJames went on to lead the Miami Heat to two championships in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers to a championship in 2016 and the Lakers to their first title in a decade last season.\n\n\"He's a world-class leader,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who guided James from 2010 to 2014. \"He's always had instincts to lead, and now he's really made it an art. It's a competitive advantage, his leadership, and he's developed it each year that he's been in this league. And he's utilizing it more and more and more to have that multiplying effect.\"\n\nJames' leadership was never more on display it was than during the 2016 NBA Finals, when he helped the Cavaliers overcome a 3-1 series deficit against the Warriors to win the franchise's first title.\n\nTyronn Lue, who coached James during that time and played alongside Jordan in his final two seasons on the Washington Wizards from 2001 to '03, said the two men are much more alike than different.\n\nWhen asked to compare their leadership styles, Lue didn't hesitate.\n\n\"The same,\" said Lue, who now coaches the LA Clippers. \"I think they both wanted to win and would do anything it took to win.\"\n\nBoth players got the results they wanted.\n\nJordan won six championships. James trails him by two rings, but he is played arguably the best basketball of his career at age 36 for a Lakers team poised to compete for another title this season.\n\nPlaying alongside either of them is something teammates will never forget.\n\nWhen asked if he'd want his children to play with Jordan, Williams reluctantly said yes.\n\nIt was impossibly tough, too tough – but it changed his life.\n\n\"He looked out for me,\" Williams said. \"He got me my shoe contract at Nike. He didn't stop the vets from getting on me, but he made sure it didn't go too far. There was a little-big brother kind of thing there. But he also knew I needed to take my floaties off and be able to swim in the deep end.\"\n\nAs for Davis, he still sometimes has \"pinch me\" moments about being teammates with James.\n\nA big one came last postseason\n\nWhen the Lakers were on a team bus headed to a game, Davis came across a social media post that showed James in the top three all time of many major statistical categories. Davis, who attended James' basketball camp in Ohio when he was 15 years old, couldn't help but marvel at the fact that they were now competing for a championship together, and he decided to pour his heart out in a text to James, telling him how much he has inspired him throughout his career.\n\nImmediately after sending it, Davis became a bit worried.\n\n\"It felt kinda awkward to walk in the locker room, like, sending a heartfelt message to him, and now we're about to go play, and we're right next to each other,\" Davis said. \"I'm like, 'Damn, what's he gonna say?' 'Man, you soft,' or, 'You gonna send this before a game?' So it was kinda weird.\"\n\nBut James didn't say a word at the time.\n\nHe waited until after the game to acknowledge the text, knowing anything else would've embarrassed his teammate before an important game.\n\nFor James, being a leader is a delicate dance. It's something that requires patience and impeccable timing.\n\nEven though he's in the twilight of his career, it's still one of the most important aspects of his game that he continually works on.\n\n\"Leadership is not a one-day thing, not a one-trick pony,\" he said. \"It's an everyday thing, both on and off the floor. And I take full responsibility for that.\"\n\nMelissa Rohlin is an NBA reporter for FOX Sports.

          "raw_content": "5 ways LeBron James has made a huge impact off the court\n\n\n\nChristian Alamodin\n\nLeBron James is one of the best basketball players to ever step on the court. He's completely transformed the sport since his NBA debut in 2003, with similar players following in his footsteps since.\n\nWhat makes LeBron James a very interesting player to see is how vocal and influential he is off the court as well.\n\nThere have been plenty of instances where the King showed everyone just how influential he can be. Here are five ways LeBron James made his presence felt throughout the league.\n\nThe financial boom he brings to cities\n\nLeBron James is not just a player, but he is also a big brand. He's got the Midas touch. His talent and charisma make him one of the most sought-after athletes in the world, and companies are always at his door, looking to cash in on his brand.\n\nIn fact, cities that were in contention for the LeBron James Sweepstakes in 2018 weren't only anticipating his arrival in terms of his talent to dribble the ball.\n\nIt was revealed by Selena Hill of Black Enterprise that cities would feel a massive boost to their books, with New York getting a $1.7 billion boost to their economy if he made the move to the Big Apple.\n\nMoreover, Fortune's Sarah Gray revealed that James's arrival to the City of Angels would be bringing up to $400,000,000 in profit for the city and create up to 3,000 jobs in the food industry, as establishments within a mile of Staples Center would pop up like mushrooms.\n\nJames knows that Black Lives Matter\n\nGrowing up under duress in Akron, OH, James knew how tough a rough background can be. He also understands that the system as it is now is not working fairly for people of color.\n\nJames has been a staunch critic of police brutality against African Americans and called for accountability on the police force. Moreover, he's not shy to tackle the racism he and his people are facing every day.\n\nWhile he's been told by analysts to shut up and dribble, he's not afraid to use his privilege as an NBA superstar to bring up racial injustices.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of tragic things happening in Charlottesville,” James says, per CNBC's Ruth Umoh. “I have this platform, and I’m somebody that has a voice of command, and the only way for us to get better as a society and for us to get better as people is love. And that’s the only way we’re going to be able to conquer something as one.”\n\nJames speaks up on national issues\n\nJames' opinions aren't limited to racial injustices. He also takes an active stand on national policy, not afraid to let his opinions on politics and pressing national issues be heard.\n\nHe's not afraid to call out people who he thinks are acting like a bum. He was very involved in the 2016 campaign of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He happily gave his opinion on any social issues that transcended the basketball court.\n\nThe greatest thing about LeBron James speaking up is that he made it okay for the rest of the league to let their opinions be known about social issues. He helped the NBA become one of the most socially involved professional sports league in the United States.\n\nHis continuous philanthropy to his native Ohio\n\nLBJ may have traded the Cavalier wine for the Laker gold, but they can never take away the Akron out of the man. His charity, the LeBron James Family Foundation, is continuously involved in the community.\n\nJames commits a certain amount of his money in ensuring that the kids in the community get programs and initiatives that will help them grow up in a kinder and more holistic environment.\n\nThe biggest project of his foundation yet is the I PROMISE Institute.\n\nJames is a perfect role model for young kids to aspire to be\n\nJames made a few questionable basketball decisions in his career.\n\nHe's married to his high school sweetheart and has three kids with her. He's visible and involved in his children's lives, and his support for his son's blossoming basketball career is nothing short of adorable.\n\nHe doesn't forget his roots and is always involved in his hometown. He also shows his intelligence as he's not afraid to talk about politics. He's presented himself as a well-rounded person who has done a lot of right things. He's a perfect role model for kids to follow.\n\nChristian Alamodin is a writer for ClutchPoints.\n\n🚨 Get viral NBA graphics, memes, rumors and trending news\n    delivered right to your inbox with the Clutch Newsletter.\n\n"

The off-court achievement that James is most proud of, he says, is working to uplift the lives of people like Smiley in his hometown of Akron.\n\nMany athletes have excelled in one or more of these areas. But few have done all of them as well as James, who is closing in on passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA’s career scoring record.\n\n“His goal, I believe, is to have 10% of his wealth go to causes and support communities, which is an amazing goal,” said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, a professor of sports management at George Washington University. “I would say he’s maybe above and beyond others, just on that aspiration alone.”\n\nJames is, by any measure, an overwhelming success. And he makes Smiley — one of the many people in Akron who have received financial support from his foundation — believe that she can be a success as well.\n\n“If I did not have the LeBron program, I probably wouldn’t have ever gone to college. I would be living in a not-so-positive environment,” said the 19-year-old Smiley.\n\n“His ability to help people’s futures,” she added, “is what makes LeBron a great person.”\n\nJames, who entered the NBA straight after high school in 2003, planned early on to use his talents, fame — and, yes, his growing financial resources — to have on impact on the world beyond basketball.\n\n“Even before I got into the NBA, I knew I wanted to find a way to give back to my community,” said James. Although James bounced from home to home during his childhood, and experienced financial insecurity for many of those years, he also was given enormous support from friends, neighbors and educators.\n\nThe LeBron James Family Foundation, founded in 2004, at first gained local attention by giving away bikes and backpacks. Then it began looking at after-school programs, with students scattered across several dozen schools, and eventually created a public school currently serving about 575 third through eighth graders. Today the school includes a family resource center that provides a wide-range of services to parents, including mental health, financial literacy, legal aid and GED courses.\n\nJust down the street from the school, the foundation provides rent-free housing to as many as 16 different families — when needed — and it has plans to build 50 units of affordable housing.\n\n“I couldn’t have guessed how much it would grow,” James said in late January. “But we got here by listening and responding to our community and what they need.”\n\nJames has made over $400 million in NBA salary during his time with Cleveland, Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. Another $100 million is on the way in the next 2-1/2 years or so.\n\nJames is a pitchman for Nike, GMC, AT&T and many more multinational companies. He owns a piece of the Boston Red Sox and Britain’s Liverpool football club. His entertainment company, SpringHill — named after the modest apartment complex he grew up in — is valued at $725 million and has produced movies for HBO and Netflix.\n\n“He’s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven’t had the same advantages as others,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said in 2018, a sentiment he’s repeated many times since. “They see in this guy somebody who has consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace and gives them a voice and lets them know that you can speak about anything.”\n\nJames puts so much focus on giving back to Akron because of the help people there gave to him and his family. “He’s never lost sight of that,” said Michele Campbell, the executive director of James’ foundation. “I think that keeps him grounded.”\n\nJust how down to earth “King James” really was got called into question in 2010. That’s when he went on television to announce that he was leaving Cleveland to play in Miami. Billed as “The Decision” — and broadcast on ESPN — the live event was widely ripped as egotistical. But from James’ perspective, the broadcast raised around $4 million for charity, a fact that was largely overlooked.\n\nJust a couple of years later, James would use his star power to help draw attention to a cause bigger than himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin — a Black Florida teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer — James tweeted a photo of Heat players wearing hoodies and bowing their heads that included the hashtag “WeWantJustice.”\n\nIn 2020, James helped lead the “More Than A Vote” movement, which included registration and early-vote drives and stressed the need for people — particularly Black voters — to get to the polls to fight disenfranchisement.\n\nAlso in 2020, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, James was one of the players calling for an end to racial inequality and police brutality.\n\n“Everything I do,” James said late last year, “has to have a purpose.”\n\nJames has all the money and all the fame that he ever wanted or needed. His NBA records, including the scoring title, are going to last for a very long time.\n\nAs will his off-court endeavors.\n\n“His ability to help others and put others first is what makes him a great person,” Smiley said. “Not the baskets he shot.”\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\n\n"

I gotta get to the locker room to start my process to get ready for the next game.\n\n\"I'll be sitting in the locker room, foot on an ice bag, ice bags on. I got my smoothie and my fruit, and I'm already getting to it right now. ... During a loss they was like, 'Oh, he's a poor sport.' Like, he's leaving the court. ... And then they start seeing me doing it during the wins and they was like, 'He's got no sportsmanship!'\"\n\nEvery second counts for @KingJames. ðªð¾Episode 2 is out now: https://t.co/pwk8BEr2F6 pic.twitter.com/ouYGmkl7AS\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, as James was recently seen dapping up Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler following the Lakers' loss to the Golden State Warriors last week. Even with The King's unmatched stamina and durability throughout his 22 years and counting in the league, it makes sense that sometimes he just wants to go home and rest his feet after a grueling game.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\nKristen Wong is a staff writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.

The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSport | Basketball\nLeague | National Basketball Association\nAwarded for | Most valuable playerof theNBA Finals\nHistory\nFirst award | 1969\nMost wins | Michael Jordan(6 awards)\nMost recent | Jaylen Brown(1st award)\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nContents\n\nWinners\n\n^ | Denotes player who is still active in the NBA\n* | Elected to theNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n§ | 1st time eligible for Hall of Fame in

            "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

For those who witnessed Jordan's excellence over the course of two three-peats with the Bulls, it reinforced the belief that he is the greatest player to ever touch the court.\nA current star has complicated that GOAT (greatest of all time) conversation, of course. There is an argument to be made for putting LeBron James over Jordan, and James' case only grew stronger after he became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 career points.\nThe Sporting News' Bill Bender has a helpful guide with the most important talking points if you're ready to discuss MJ vs. LeBron, but we're simply here to provide the facts you need to justify your choice. Don't be the person yelling \"six rings\" with no backup plan.\nHere's a closer look at where the GOAT debate stands...\n(All stats current as of Jan. 29, 2025)\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season stats\nOn a per-game basis, Jordan is superior in the scoring department, but James grabs rebounds and dishes out assists at a higher rate. While both players are known for tenacious defense on the wing, Jordan finished first in the league in steals three times in his career. James has not yet claimed a steals title.\nMICHAEL JORDAN AUTHENTIC JERSEYS — BULLS, DREAM TEAM, UNC AND MORE\nSHOP NOW\nIn terms of longevity, James holds a clear advantage. The gap in total numbers will widen as long as James stays healthy, and he doesn't appear to be slowing down at age 40.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n30.1    Points  27.0\n6.2 Rebounds    7.5\n5.3 Assists 7.4\n2.3 Steals  1.5\n0.8 Blocks  0.7\n2.7 Turnovers   3.5\n38.3    Minutes 37.8\n49.7    Field goal %    50.6\n32.7    3-point %   34.9\n83.5    Free throw %    73.6\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n1,072   Games   1,534\n32,292  Points  41,474\n6,672   Rebounds    11,504\n5,633   Assists 11,385\n2,514   Steals  2,311\n893 Blocks  1,134\n2,924   Turnovers   5,374\n41,011  Minutes 58,059\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season advanced stats\nIt's all about which category you choose when it comes to advanced statistics. VORP and Win Shares favor James, but PER and Box Plus/Minus go to Jordan.\nPick a side, nerds!

Despite James' increased usage and efficiency from beyond the arc over the course of his career, it's worth noting that he shoots the same percentage as Jordan from 3-point range.\nOh, and the lazy narrative claiming James shrinks in big games — his postseason lines are often more impressive than his regular-season performances. That's not a smart way to argue against him.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n33.4    Points  28.4\n6.4 Rebounds    9.0\n5.7 Assists 7.2\n2.1 Steals  1.7\n0.9 Blocks  1.0\n3.1 Turnovers   3.6\n41.8    Minutes 41.3\n48.7    Field goal %    49.7\n33.2    3-point %   33.2\n82.8    Free throw %    74.1\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n179 Games   287\n5,987   Points  8,162\n1,152   Rebounds    2,583\n1,022   Assists 2,067\n376 Steals  483\n158 Blocks  275\n546 Turnovers   1,034\n7,474   Minutes 11,858\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Playoff advanced stats\nJordan stands above James in PER, and he is the all-time playoff leader in Box Plus/Minus. But James tops everyone in VORP and Win Shares.\nSo, yeah, these guys are pretty good.\nJordan  Advanced    LeBron\n28.6    Player Efficiency Rating    27.9\n24.7    Value Over Replacement  36.1\n11.1    Box Plus/Minus  10.0\n39.8    Win Shares  58.7\n56.8    True Shooting % 58.4\n35.6    Usage % 31.7\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Accolades and awards\nAnd here's the big one. Jordan fans have championships in their back pockets. MJ went a perfect 6-0 in the NBA Finals and never needed a Game 7 to win those series.\nJames has gone 4-6 in his 10 NBA Finals appearances, but he also controlled the Eastern Conference with the Cavaliers and Heat for almost an entire decade.\nJordan  Accolades   LeBron\n6   Championships   4\n5   MVPs    4\n6   Finals MVPs 4\n11  All-NBA 20\n9   All-Defense 6\n14  All-Star    20\n10  Scoring titles  1\nJORDAN GREER\nJordan Greer has been with The Sporting News since 2015.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James vs Michael Jordan playoff records: Total sweeps, win and loss record, win percentage and more\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate will likely never stop. These two players are considered the best of all time, which is why many basketball fans love to debate who's better.\n\nNearly everyone knows that Jordan had a perfect 6-0 record in the NBA Finals. However, he had to go through many struggles to get there. LeBron, on the other hand, has won only four championships, but has advanced to the final stage 10 times.\n\nDue to the reports of LeBron James' retirement, let's take a look at how well these two legends performed in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate mostly ignores Jordan's playoff struggles\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate often ignores Jordan's early struggles in the playoffs. While the Chicago Bulls guard was 6-0 in the finals, he was eliminated several times in the first round.\n\nDuring his glorious career, Jordan was 119-60 in playoff games, winning 30 out of 37 (81.1%) series. His winning percentage was 66.4%, meaning that he won two out of three games on average.\n\nJordan was swept twice in his career, both times by the Boston Celtics. The first time this happened was in the 1986 NBA playoffs, and the second time was just a year later.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: Top 10 most undeserving NBA All-Star Selections of All Time featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan & more\n\nJordan's Chicago Bulls swept nine teams during his career. However, it's important to note that the NBA used the best-of-five series format in the first round while Jordan was in the league. Due to this, a sweep required only three wins.\n\nThe Bulls legend won nine out of 30 series with a sweep, meaning that he swept his opponent in 30% of the series, which is remarkable.\n\nLeBron James has been swept three times. The first time, James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the 2007 NBA Finals in four games. The second time was in the 2018 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, while the third time was against the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals.\n\nLeBron's all-time playoff record is 182-100, good enough for a 64.5% win percentage. He won 41 out of 53 (77.3%) playoff series, but many fans use his 4-6 NBA Finals record against him, especially in the LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: What did Michael Jordan say on LeBron James breaking all-time scoring record?\n\nWhen it comes to victorious sweeps, the four-time NBA champion has done this 11 times. LeBron's sweep percentage is 26.8%, which is slowly lower than Jordan's, but still impressive.\n\nAsmir Pekmic\n\n​Besides playing basketball both in video games and in real life, Asmir is a longtime fan of the Miami Heat. Even though Dwyane Wade, his favorite player, retired, he still finds joy in watching the current squad ​​led by Jimmy Butler. By the age of 30, he's seen many fantastic moments, but Ray Allen's \"The Shot\" and D-Wade's game-winning buzzer-beater against the Bulls are his favorites. \n\nAsmir comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina and he's been with Sportskeeda since May 2022.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

            "raw_content": "ESPN\n\nNBA\n\nThe top 25 NBA Finals performances of all time\n\nAs this year's Finals take place with the Miami Heat facing the Denver Nuggets, we're looking back at legendary performances from superstars such as LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Michael Jordan, with the help of Basketball-Reference.com's game score archive.\n\nEditor's Picks\n\nNBA experts' picks for Heat-Nuggets and Finals MVP1y\n\nThe six things you need to know for this epic NBA Finals2yKirk Goldsberry\n\nNBA Finals 2023: Schedule, news, highlights, scores, more316dESPN\n\nGame score, pioneered by John Hollinger, is a measure of a player's single-game value factoring in all elements of the box score from scoring efficiency to playmaking to rebounding and defensive impact. Although imperfect, it quickly captures a player's baseline performance and allows us to compare conference finals games going back to 1978 -- the first year the NBA tracked individual turnovers.\n\nOver that span of 45 years of NBA Finals, we've highlighted the top 25 individual performances, 16 of which came in victories for their team. How did each player succeed and what did their heroics mean for the series and the NBA playoffs as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the top conference finals performances, highlighted by four from James and two from Jimmy Butler, who will look to add to his total in the games to come.\n\n-- Kevin Pelton\n\n1. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 42.5\n\n2016 Finals: Game 6 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\nBy now you've seen the viral clip of James in the Cavs' locker room after Game 6 of the 2016 Finals, putting the 15th piece of the team's 16-piece Larry O'Brien Trophy championship puzzle in place while telling his team the Warriors are \"f---ed up ... mentally and physically.\" He dealt a fair portion of that damage with 41 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks. Cleveland jumped out to a 31-11 lead after the first quarter and won by 15 points to set up a Game 7 for the ages.\n\n-- Dave McMenamin\n\n2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 42.0\n\n2021 Finals: Game 6 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nWith the Bucks one win away from winning their first NBA title in 50 years, all it took was Antetokounmpo having one of the greatest games in Finals history to end their drought.\n\nAntetokounmpo finished with 50 points on 16-for-25 shooting from the field to go along with 14 rebounds, 2 assists and 5 blocks was one thing. But for him to also go 17-for-19 from the free throw line, after all of the chatter about his foul shooting during the postseason, was the definition of rising to meet the moment.\n\nAnd, as a result, Antetokounmpo and the Bucks were able to celebrate a championship on their home floor in Milwaukee.\n\n-- Tim Bontemps\n\n3. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 42.0\n\n2020 Finals: Game 3 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nButler carried the Heat throughout their time in the 2020 Orlando, Florida, Bubble, but never more so than in Game 3 of the Finals against James and the Lakers. Butler scored 40 points with 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a win that not only kept the Heat in the series, but further cemented his status as one of the game's premiere playoff players. Butler played 45 minutes, leaving everything he had on the floor while making big play after big play all night.\n\n-- Nick Friedell\n\n4. Jimmy Butler, Miami Heat | Game score: 41.3\n\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Los Angeles Lakers\n\nWith his team's season hanging in the balance in the bubble, Butler delivered another all-time performance to the tune of 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists in a Game 5 victory over the Lakers. Butler knew he had to set a tone for the rest of his teammates and that's exactly what he did, following up his Game 3 showcase with another game that will be remembered within the Heat organization for years. Aside from Butler's ability to make big plays all over the floor, the picture of an exhausted Butler from this game remains one of the most memed in history.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n5. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 41.3\n\n2018 Finals: Game 1 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\nIn the greatest game of James' individual postseason run, the star forward became just the fifth player in league history to top 50 points in an NBA Finals game, joining Elgin Baylor (61), Michael Jordan (55), Rick Barry (55) and Jerry West (53) with 51 points. He also had 8 rebounds and 8 assists, all against one of the greatest teams ever assembled. The masterful performance still wasn't enough to get a win, as the Warriors prevailed in overtime with two crucial sequences going against the Cavs. First, James was called for a blocking foul on Kevin Durant with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two. Had it been a charge, maybe things would have been different. And second, in one of the most memed moments of James' career, JR Smith dribbled out the clock when George Hill missed a free throw with four seconds left with the score tied, rather than go for the go-ahead bucket near the hoop, causing James to splay his arms toward his teammate in exasperation.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n6. Tim Duncan, San Antonio Spurs | Game score: 40.8\n\n2003 Finals: Game 6 vs. New Jersey Nets\n\nDuncan set the tone for the Spurs' Finals defeat of the Nets with an all-time box-score stuffing performance in the series opener: 32 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, 7 blocks and 3 steals. It was the most blocks and steals ever recorded in a 30-20 Finals outing and the third-most assists. Duncan was almost as dominant in the closeout Game 6, putting up a 21-point, 20-rebound, 10-assist, 8-block line to clinch his second Finals MVP.\n\n-- Tim MacMahon\n\n7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 39.8\n\n2018 Finals: Game 3 vs. Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nAny time the Warriors needed a big play in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals against the Cavaliers, Durant delivered. He had 43 points, 13 rebounds and 7 assists, but it was a clutch 3-pointer over two Cavs defenders with 52 seconds left that sealed both the game and his place in Finals history. An all-time dagger from an all-time player. Durant would go on to win his second straight Finals MVP and lead the Warriors to their second consecutive title.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n8. Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.6\n\n1980 Finals: Game 6 vs. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nTop stories of the week from\n\nGet exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers.\n• NHL Urgency Index: Who needs to win now? »\n• CFB 2026 recruiting class rankings »\n• Predicting which NFL teams will draft QBs »\n More ESPN+ content »\n\nJohnson, who was a year removed from leading Michigan State to the NCAA title, stepped into the starting center role for the Finals closeout game with legendary big man Kareem Abdul-Jabbar staying in Los Angeles to nurse a badly sprained ankle. \"Never fear, Magic is here!\" Johnson told his teammates as they boarded the flight to Philadelphia. Johnson delivered the best Finals performance ever by a rookie, scoring 42 points, grabbing 15 rebounds and dishing out 7 assists to lead the Lakers to the first of their five championships in the Showtime era.\n\n-- MacMahon\n\n9. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers | Game score: 39.2\n\n2016 Finals: Game 5 vs. Golden State Warriors\n\n\"What did you say Klay [Thompson] said?\" James asked a reporter prior to Game 5 of the 2016 NBA Finals. \"Klay said, 'I guess he just got his feelings hurt,'\" the reporter replied, detailing Thompson's response to James' run-in with Draymond Green in Game 4. Then James burst out an indulgent chuckle. It was the start of the most significant postseason stretch of his career, winning Games 5 through 7 to help the Cavaliers become the first team in Finals history to climb out of a 3-1 deficit and win. James was brilliant in Game 5, putting up 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals and 3 blocks as he and Kyrie Irving became the first pair of teammates to ever drop 40-plus in the same Finals game. The comeback was on.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n10. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 39.1\n\n2020 Finals: Game 5 vs. Miami Heat\n\nMuch like the Smith game in the 2018 Finals, James' brilliance in Game 5 of the 2020 Finals sometimes gets forgotten, because of the attention paid to Danny Green's potential game-winning 3-pointer from the top of the key missing with under 10 seconds remaining. But the fact that James nearly closed out the bubble by making 15 out of 21 shots -- including 6-of-9 3s -- to score 40 points with 13 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 steals while wearing the \"Black Mamba\" uniform that held so much significance to the Lakers' franchise that season in remembering Kobe Bryant makes it one of the finest playoff games of James' or any other player's career.\n\n-- McMenamin\n\n11. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls | Game score: 38.9\n\n1993 Finals: Game 4 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nJordan scored nearly half of the Bulls' points with a 55-point outburst in Game 4 of the 1993 Finals. It was one of the highest scoring performances in Finals history and put the Bulls on the verge of their first three-peat.\n\nChicago won the first two games of the series on the road before dropping Game 3 after returning home, but Jordan would not allow the Suns back into the series. Phoenix had no answer in stopping him from getting to the rim and Jordan shot 56.8% from the field with 8 rebounds and 4 assists. Jordan's 55 points are tied for the second-most in Finals history, trailing only a 61-point game by Baylor in 1962.\n\n-- Jamal Collier\n\n12. Shaquille O'Neal, Los Angeles Lakers | Game score: 37.9\n\n2000 Finals: Game 1 vs. Indiana Pacers\n\nShaq's 2000 series against Indiana was one of the most dominant Finals ever, as he averaged 38.0 PPG to rank third in Finals history behind Jordan in 1993 (41.0) and Baylor in 1962 (40.6). Fresh off a Game 7 comeback to beat the Portland Trail Blazers, O'Neal served the Pacers notice in the series opener at the then-Staples Center, putting up 41 points on 21-of-31 shooting and 19 rebounds as the Lakers pulled away late. The 21 field goals were one shy of Baylor's 1962 Finals record, which came on 15 more shot attempts.\n\n-- Pelton\n\n13. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks | Game score: 37.4\n\n2021 Finals: Game 3 vs. Phoenix Suns\n\nWhen the Bucks returned home from Phoenix down 2-0 in the Finals, it looked like their storybook season would wind up being anything but.\n\nThat's where Antetokounmpo came in. With a loss all but certain to end Milwaukee's season, Antetokounmpo made sure that would not happen, going for 41 points, 13 rebounds and 6 assists in just under 38 minutes, while also going -- in a precursor to his truly legendary performance in Game 6 -- 13-for-17 from the foul line. It wound up being the first of four straight wins for the Bucks in the series, as Milwaukee would go on to win its first title since 1971.\n\n-- Bontemps\n\n14. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors | Game score: 37.2\n\n2019 Finals: Game 3 vs. Toronto Raptors\n\nThe barrage of shots from all over the floor started early in a Game 3 loss to the Raptors as Curry carried an offense playing without star forward Durant, who was out because of an Achilles injury. While he couldn't carry the Warriors to a victory, Curry hit six 3-pointers and scored 47 points, giving Warriors fans one last show in Oracle Arena before the team moved to Chase Center after the season. While Curry's performance was a highlight for the Warriors, this series will always be remembered by Durant's Achilles tear in Game 5 and Klay Thompson's ACL tear in Game 6.\n\n-- Friedell\n\n15. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns | Game score: 37.0\n\n1993 Finals: Game 2 vs. Chicago Bulls\n\nAfter a subpar Game 1, where he posted 21 points on 9-of-25 shooting as the Bulls won the opener in Phoenix, Barkley bounced back with his best game of the 1993 Finals: 42 points on 16-of-26 shooting, plus 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Only one problem: Jordan also scored 42 points, coming within an assist of a triple-double. While Barkley got the edge in game score by virtue of his efficiency, Jordan's Chicago team earned the 111-108 win, taking a 2-0 lead in a series they would go on to win in six games.\n\n-- Pelton\n\nThe best of the rest\n\n16. Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls, 1992 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 36.9\n17. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks, 2021 Finals Game 2 | Game score: 36.7\n18. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers, 2017 Finals Game 5 | Game score: 36.2\n19. Draymond Green, Golden State Warriors, 2016 Finals Game 7 | Game score: 35.9\n20. Charles Barkley, Phoenix Suns, 1993 Finals Game 4 | Game score: 35.6\n21. Allen Iverson, Philadelphia 76ers, 2001 Finals Game 1 | Game score: 35.0\n22.

            "raw_content": "NBA\n\nLeBron James and the Most Versatile NBA Stars of All Time\n\nIt's no coincidence that LeBron James followed up an MVP-worthy regular season with his first NBA title and second Olympic gold medal.\n\nHe's able to lead his teams to greatness thanks in large part to the wide variety of contributions he makes to those teams. Whereas most clubs are happy just to have an elite scorer and some competent role players, James is like a Swiss Army knife.\n\nNo matter the need at hand, there's almost certainly some way he can help.\n\nHe wasn't the first such player, and he won't be the last. He's just the very best the NBA has to offer at this moment in time.\n\nHere's a look at the 15 most versatile NBA stars of all time, including man-of-the-hour (if not man-of-the-decade) LeBron James.\n\nAlong with Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor was one of the very first players to do a little bit of everything extremely well.\n\nAt just 6'5\", Baylor was a mind-boggling good rebounder for the Minneapolis/Los Angeles Lakers. He had a Dennis Rodman-like nose for the ball, and he was a couple of inches shorter.\n\nBaylor also found a few opportunities to pass the ball. Despite averaging 27.4 points for his career, he also notched 4.3 assists. The forward brought a new brand of athleticism to the game that allowed him to play on the wing while also mixing it up in the paint.\n\nHow he'd fair in today's NBA is anyone's guess, but there's little doubt that today's NBA wouldn't look the same without this kind of predecessor.\n\nYou can't put this list together without including the league's all-time leader in triple-doubles, Oscar Robertson.\n\nEarly in his career, Robertson was a triple-double waiting to happen. In fact, he became the only player in league history to average one in 1961-62 with 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and a league-leading 11.4 assists. That just doesn't happen anymore, and it's hard to imagine even LeBron James accomplishing something like that.\n\nOf course, it goes without saying that the NBA of the early '60s isn't what it is today.\n\nBut, that shouldn't diminish how much Robertson did for the game. The 6'5\" guard was the godfather of versatility.\n\nThere are plenty arguments to be made for why guys like Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell were more dominant big men, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played the game at a level that most centers before or since could never hope to match.\n\nThe 7'2\" giant was always an elite scorer, but he was also a dominant rebounder and skilled passer during his prime years.\n\nIn his first season with the Los Angeles Lakers, he averaged 27.7 points, 16.8 rebounds, five assists and 4.1 blocks.\n\nWhile his opposition may not have been as stiff as what the average center has to face these days, there's still no question this guy was an incredibly gifted talent capable of impacting the game in a lot of ways.\n\nHe also brought a measure of finesse to the position that simply eludes most seven-footers at a basic level. From his scoring ability to his defensive impact, Kareem was one of the first big men to truly do it all.\n\nYou probably remember Julius Erving for his iconic highlights, but Dr. J was far more than a slam-dunk artist.\n\nThough Erving was never much of a long-range threat, he was a prolific scorer thanks to his ability to do just about anything he wanted in the painted area. He could seamlessly glide into the paint, and he knew what to do once he got there.\n\nBut, Erving was also a well-rounded swingman, often averaging over six or seven rebounds a game along with three or four assists.\n\nThe length and athleticism that has come to define the NBA wing owes much to the 6'6\" Erving. He proved that you can spend time in the backcourt while still making a significant impact in the paint.\n\nNo, Larry Bird didn't have the quickest feet this game's every seen, but he found plenty of ways to make up for it.\n\nIn addition to emerging as one of the NBA's very best shooters in the 1980s, Bird also averaged 10 rebounds per contest thanks to his 6'9\" size and excellent anticipation. Always physical and quick to the ball, Bird wasn't your typical jump-shooter.\n\nNor was he simply an earlier copy of Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nThis guy was also an outstanding passer, averaging 6.3 assists for his career and making the most of cohorts like Kevin McHale and Robert Parish.\n\nBird could play either forward position, and he in many ways exemplifies the \"spread-4\" concept increasingly relied upon to space the floor in today's half-court offenses.\n\nThere haven't been many triple-double machines like Magic Johnson, and it's no surprise why.\n\nAt 6'9\" Johnson gave the Los Angeles Lakers plenty of size. As one of the best passers the game's ever seen, he also gave them a floor general who could make the most of weapons like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy.\n\nFor his career, Johnson averaged 19.5 points, 11.2 assists, 7.3 rebounds and 1.9 steals.\n\nThe NBA wasn't used to a man that size having such quick hands and feet, and it showed. Though LeBron James inherited a lot from Dr. J's above-the-rim game, he owes just as much if not more to Magic's incredible play-making skills.\n\nWith the careers of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson coming to an end, Scottie Pippen quite simply redefined versatility for the next generation.\n\nHe popularized the notion of the \"point-forward\" thanks to his length and uncanny passing ability. With point guards like John Paxson and B.J. Armstrong so adept at spotting up for perimeter buckets, running the offense often became Pippen's responsibility.\n\nBut, for all his contributions to the Chicago Bulls' triangle offense, Pippen was also one of the NBA's very best defenders. He could effectively guard anyone on the wing and could hold his own against more than a few 4s.\n\nFrom Tracy McGrady to LeBron James, many of the league's best forwards have Pippen to thank for expanding what it really means to be a forward.\n\nClyde Drexler's career line says it all.\n\nHe averaged 20.4 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.6 assists in 1,086 regular-season games. He averaged as many as 7.9 rebounds (in 1988-89) and eight assists (in 1985-86). As point guard Terry Porter came into the picture, Drexler became more of a pure scorer, but he continued to do a little bit of everything for the eternally underrated Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nDrexler never got the recognition he deserved on account of that MJ guy, but he remained the Western Conference's most well-rounded shooting guard for a good five or six years.\n\nNo, he didn't play four different positions, and Scottie Pippen usually gets all the attention as the \"versatile\" one, but Michael Jordan makes a case on a couple of different levels.\n\nAs arguably the most gifted scorer the game has ever seen, MJ did his damage in a number of different ways. He's as dangerous as anyone on the wing, either facing the basket or posting up. The range of moves at his disposal in either instance was too mind-boggling for merely mortal defenders to anticipate.\n\nJordan could also score from the perimeter or exploit opportunities off the ball, cutting to the basket or coming off screens for quick jumpers. His jumper was unguardable, and his ability to finish in the paint was equally problematic.\n\nWe all know what he did on the fast break.\n\nAnd yet, for all the different ways he could score the ball, Jordan was also an elite defender, an excellent passer and a constant presence on the glass.\n\nHe may have done it all from the shooting guard spot, but that doesn't make him any less versatile.\n\nChris Webber will forever be remembered for all the wrong things, but he was one of the game's best power forwards in his day.\n\nDuring his finest seasons with the Sacramento Kings, we were reminded that big men can indeed pass the ball thanks to the opportunities he found in Rick Adelman's Princeton offense. Webber worked wonders from the high-post, passing to cutters and shooting an automatic jumper in equal proportion.\n\nHe averaged 4.2 assists for his career.\n\nWebber was also an underrated defender. He used his soft hands to rack up plenty of steals and blocks, and he notched 9.7 rebounds per game for his career.\n\nFew have aged as gracefully as Grant Hill, but this guy was one of the league's very best players in his prime.\n\nIn his third season, the small forward averaged 21.4 points, nine rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.8 steals. At various points in his career, Hill's also guarded both forward positions along with some shooting guards, and done a first-rate job of it.\n\nIn his younger years, he also took on ball-handling and facilitating responsibilities. Hill looked to be one of the league's next greats until injuries derailed his stint with the Orlando Magic.\n\nHill's managed a successful reemergence, but it's been a long time since he did it all as the Detroit Pistons' breakout franchise player.\n\nIf Kevin Garnett weren't such a beast inside the paint, he very well could have played the 3 position earlier in his career.\n\nHe has the length of a center, the interior explosiveness of a power forward and the perimeter ability of a small forward. His jumper from the high post is one of the most automatic in the game, but his moves in the post are just as dangerous.\n\nIn 2002-03, arguably his best all-around season, KG averaged 23 points, 13.5 rebounds, six assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.4 steals.\n\nThere have always been better scorers and more dominant big men, but there's never been someone quite like Garnett.\n\nOh yeah, he's also one heck of a tough guy who's just as much of a leader in the locker room as he is on the floor.\n\nAfter Tracy McGrady's career was decimated by injury, it's easy to forget just how good the 33-year-old was in his prime years.\n\nHe averaged as many as 32.1 points per game in 2002-03 and regularly posted over five assists and six rebounds a contest, reaching careers-highs of 6.5 and 7.9, respectively. At his best, T-Mac was a spitting image of Scottie Pippen, only with even better scoring instincts.\n\nThe 6'8\" forward used his smooth athleticism to glide around the floor and make plays from anywhere.\n\nGiven just how good he was with the ball in his hands, McGrady turned the point-forward role into an art and made everything he did look awfully good.\n\nEven with a scaled down role, today's T-Mac remains a veteran capable of making a wide range of contributions. But, it's safe to say we'll never see him do the things he did in his early 20s with the Orlando Magic and Houston Rockets.\n\nThough he's never been a very strong defender and hasn't been a stranger to that dreaded \"soft\" label, Dirk Nowitzki still deserves some consideration on this list.\n\nHe's always been a good rebounder and a better passer than most men his size, but one ability in particular has qualitatively set him apart from his peers. Dirk is almost certainly the best shooter out of any seven-footer to have played the game.\n\nYou might not think much of a big man shooting over 47 percent from the field for his career. But, when that big man was shooting jump shots, it's a different story.\n\nFrom behind the arc, Dirk's career mark is a similarly impressive 38 percent.\n\nBeyond the numbers, Nowitzki showcases a wide array of moves to free himself from even the best defenders. He can turn around, fall away and pump-fake his way to open shots whether in the post or on the wing.\n\nIn so many ways, LeBron James is the culmination of all the versatile players to come before him, the actualization of the league's best players spending decades trying to do more than the guys that came before them.\n\nLBJ is well-rounded in every possible sense.\n\nHe produces in multiple ways, plays hard on both ends of the floor and can guard virtually any position on the floor. At 6'8\" and 250 lbs, he has an unrivaled frame, but he also has the kind of uncanny athleticism you'd expect from a smaller guard.\n\nThrough the first nine years of his career, James has averaged 27.1 points, 6.2 assists and 7.9 rebounds.\n\nMore impressively, though, LeBron exerts his will defensively on the perimeter and in the post alike. Few players have taken it upon themselves to alter games in so many different ways, and few players deserve their MVPs as much as this guy.\n\n"

            "raw_content": "LeBron James: Analyzing What Makes Him the Most Versatile Player in NBA History\n\nNow that LeBron James can add the title \"NBA champion\" to his resume, it's time to examine where James fits among the NBA's all-time greats.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that James was making noise (and history) in the Ohio High School Athletic Association. When James was just 16 years old, Ryan Jones of Slam Magazine said the then-sophomore might be \"the best high school basketball player in America.\"\n\nGrant Wahl of Sports Illustrated noted the high level of praise NBA scouts doled on James as a high-school junior who already impressed with his all-around game.\n\nHeaping that much praise on a high schooler often can be disastrous.\n\nAnd James' admirers had set the bar higher than that for any high-school player before or since.\n\nDubbed \"King James,\" he was also dubbed Jordan's heir apparent before he had even left the campus of St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio.\n\nThere was no way that this child (not even a 6'7\", 225-pound man-child) could ever live up to this level of buzz, right?\n\nWell, not exactly...\n\nFast forward to 2012, and James is now unquestionably the best player on the planet. Basketball minds are still raving about his versatility, and those Jordan comparisons still resonate.\n\nYet it's hard to say that James has lived up to the \"next Jordan\" moniker.\n\nHe's simply the first LeBron James.\n\nTruth be told, James has drawn more comparisons to Magic Johnson than Jordan, but even those fail to capture the immense talent of the King.\n\nThe Johnson-James comparisons draw from a reasonable origin: Both players are 6'8\" or taller with the handles, court vision and decision-making to play the point-guard position.\n\nBut as great as Johnson was, he was never the scorer nor the defender that James is.\n\nJohnson topped the 20-point mark just four seasons in his career (his best scoring year came when he averaged 23.9 in 1986-87), while James has topped it in each of his nine seasons and has even topped the 30-point plateau in two different seasons.\n\nAs for the defensive comparisons, Johnson was lauded as a smart team defender. But he never made an all-defensive team in his NBA career.\n\nJames, meanwhile, has appeared on the past four all-defensive first teams and realistically should have an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award by now (the only piece of NBA hardware still evading the 27-year-old).\n\nWait, James can score and defend? Maybe those Jordan comparisons aren't too off base.\n\nIn terms of raw talent and importance to their teams, the comparisons are warranted.\n\nBut the two played vastly different games.\n\nJordan was every bit the athletic specimen then that James is today, but he was not initiating former Bulls coach Phil Jackson's offense. Jordan has the edge in career scoring (30.1 to 27.6), while James has the advantage in assists (6.9 to 5.3).\n\nLikewise, while Jordan could defend anyone on the perimeter, he simply didn't have the size to defend the bigs of his era on a nightly basis.\n\nJames is simply unlike anyone player the game has seen.\n\nWith his combination of size, strength, intelligence and athleticism, he can do everything on the basketball court.\n\nSports fans love to compare players across eras in order to \"decide\" who was the greatest or who will be the next so-and-so.\n\nBut basketball fans would be much better with that sliver of hope in searching for the next Jordan. Because there will never be another King James.\n\n"

He was the one who was supposed to take over from Michael Jordan and hence was given the nickname \"King James\". From being the cover athlete of Sports Illustrated while still in high school to becoming a 4 time NBA Champion and then going on to lead with his voice on topics of social justice. Amongst many achievements and accolades James has earned on the NBA court, his greatest moment came quite possibly in March 2024 when he became the one and only player to date to ever eclipse the 40,000 mark in career points. He is the greatest success story in the league's history.\n \nMichael Jordan was the pioneer who led the NBA to the global stage back in the 90s. The heights of global fame and stardom that he achieved put him in such rare air that he is still to this day considered the greatest athlete of all time. He relentlessly pursued greatness and won 6 championships with the Chicago Bulls. After retiring he went on to become a business tycoon amassing a huge amount of wealth. A few years later he bought the Charlotte Hornets and became the first-ever American athlete to do so.\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Stats\nMichael Jordan was all about taking over the game and single-handedly outplaying his opponents with his dominant game. LeBron is a more balanced player who scores when challenged to score but his game is more about getting his teammates involved, grabbing rebounds, and doing those little things that help a team get a victory.\nCareer (Averages)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPoints27.130.1Rebounds7.56.2Assists7.45.3Steals1.52.3Blocks0.70.8Turnovers3.52.7Minutes37.938.3Field goal %50.649.73-point %34.832.7Free throw %73.683.5\nCareer (Totals)LeBron JamesMichael JordanGames1,4951,072Points40,54334,241Rebounds11,2086,672Assists11,0315,633Steals2,2752,514Blocks1,114893Turnovers5,2202,924Minutes56,70041,011\n(LeBron stats as of October 2024)\n\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan Regular-Season Advanced Stats\nWhen one is comparing two different eras, it’s not ideal to just look at the major stats.

Overall, both players rank high not only in the regular season but in the postseason as well, and once again deciding the better player between the two in the postseason is still as tough as ever. In the following table, we pit LeBron James with Michael Jordan and take a look at the advanced stats of the two in the playoffs.\nAdvanced Career Stats (Playoffs)LeBron JamesMichael JordanPlayer Efficiency Rating (PER)28.228.6Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)33.924.7Box Plus/Minus (BPM)10.211.1Win Shares (WS)55.739.8True Shooting % (TS%)58.356.8Usage Rate (USG%)3235.6\nLeBron James vs Michael Jordan NBA Finals Stats\nLeBron James has been to the finals 10 times, winning the championship on four occasions.

While Jordan does lead in most of the important categories here, James is not too far behind and can still catch up before his career is over. Therefore deciding whether MJ or LeBron is better falls short in this category as well.\nAchievementsLeBron JamesMichael JordanNBA Finals appearances106Championships46Regular season MVP45Defensive Player of the Year01Finals MVP46Rookie of the Year11Scoring titles110Assist leader10Steals leader03All-Star selections2014All NBA selections2011All-Defensive selections69\nMichael Jordan vs LeBron James Net Worth\nLeBron James over his career and through other business ventures has amassed a fortune of over $1.2 billion. Basketball is the driving force behind LeBron’s wealth; when you’ve been a top player for almost 20 years, the game checks simply add up. According to Spotrac’s financial data, James has earned an impressive total of over $430 million in salary during his time in the NBA.\nKing James’ income isn’t limited to basketball, though. Other than his massive Nike contract and game checks, the Lakers star is also quite the entrepreneur. Thanks to investments in Blaze Pizza, Beats, and Liverpool FC, among other brands.\nWhile LeBron James’ net worth is nothing to look down on, he’s still nowhere near His Airness. According to Forbes, Michael Jordan’s net worth has now reached a staggering $3 billion.\nMichael Jordan didn’t make that much in the NBA. He only commanded truly massive salaries during his last two seasons in Chicago. Jordan earned $94 million in-game checks, with roughly $63 million coming in just 1996-97 and 1997-98.\nHowever, his superstar status paid dividends. Apart from his massive contract with Nike, he endorsed everything from underwear to Gatorade and also McDonald's; those deals kept the cash flowing. In retirement, he also managed to get into an elite group by becoming an owner of an NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets.\nAlso Read: LeBron James Net Worth\nHas LeBron James ever played against Michael Jordan?\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan never got the chance to play each other on the NBA court. Unfortunately for both superstars, their careers could not overlap as Jordan had made his way out of the league just a few months before LeBron stepped foot on the NBA court.\nWhile Jordan's last game in the NBA came on April 16, 2003, LeBron's first career NBA game was on Oct. 29, 2003. For die-hard fans of the NBA, a matchup between these two legends would have been something surreal, however, it may not have accounted for much as Jordan was already past his prime having turned 40 years old while LeBron on the other hand was just a rookie in 2003.\nWho is the GOAT of the NBA?\nMichael Jordan is often considered the GOAT of the NBA. At present, Jordan is the forerunner in all accolades other than All-Star appearances, All-NBA Team, and the Hall of Fame. He has a better NBA Finals record. Furthermore, he has two rings more than LeBron James. He also has three more All-Defense selections and an additional MVP award. He also holds a Defensive Player of the Year award, an accomplishment that has eluded James. LeBron's commitment to amassing his fourth ring has brought him closer to his goal - winning six or more rings.\nHowever, Jordan was not the complete player that James was. LeBron James is the only player in NBA history with 10K points, rebounds, and assists. He is in the top 10-15 of virtually every list in the league and has also become the NBA's all-time leading scorer. James also leads the league in almost every playoff statistic, having been to the NBA Finals 10 times. He is also a much better playmaker than Jordan ever was, leading the league in assists once. He has all the stats and longevity arguments in his favor over Jordan, who was mainly valued as a scorer on the offensive end. While most people would say Michael Jordan is the Greatest player of all time. Few people like Detroit Pistons rookie Cade Cunningham believe LeBron James is the greatest player.\nWho is a better player between LeBron and Jordan?\n\nImage source: CBS Sports\nLeBron James' statistics stipulate that he is the better overall basketball player. LeBron is a more efficient player, a much better passer, and a rebounder than Jordan was. Jordan, on the flip side, has a much better free throw percentage, which sustains the points-per-game statistic. The two are relatively equivalent in efficiency ratings, with Jordan being first overall in NBA history and LeBron trailing close behind at second.\nMichael averaged more steals per game, but both players are exactly even in blocks per game. Having played so many fewer games than James, Jordan's defensive capabilities do outshine the current Lakers forward. With more All-Defensive Team selections as well as an NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, the edge on that side of the ball favors the former Bulls guard. LeBron has also turned the ball over more per game as well.\nThe one thing James has in his favor are all the longevity stats and these stats will continue to stack up until he calls it a day in the NBA. Till then the gap between both players will continue to increase but then again, Jordan has already achieved so much in less time. Having said that, one of the most important records that James now possesses is leading the entire NBA in the most points ever scored.\nAfter going through everything the game has to offer, the choice between the GOAT of the NBA does come down to personal taste. Both are legends of the game who have given it their all on the court, and their statistics and records are also comparable. It is difficult to pick out any one player as the GOAT since the eras are different, the rules are different, and players play in different positions, so comparing a guard with a forward is not an ideal way of arguing who is better.\nAlso read: All about Michael Jordan’s net worth\nRead Less  \nFAQs on Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James\nQ.

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

            "raw_content": "What Questions Automatically Spark a Debate?\n\nRecently, I watched a podcast called Club Shay Shay where Shannon Sharpe (3X Super Bowl NFL champ) and Charles Barkley (former NBA power forward) debated the difference between 1990s basketball players and current NBA players. For those not into sports, hang in there.\n\nHumans love to compare. Celebrity magazines ask, “Who wore this dress better?” Smartphone users debate, “Apple or Android?” (Is there really a comparison?) With the U.S. elections approaching… well, let’s not go there! But in the podcast, the question was:\n\nWho is the better basketball player, Michael Jordan or LeBron James?\n\nI rolled my eyes, expecting Charles Barkley to glorify the good ole days of “real basketball.” He could’ve used stats or stories to stand his ground. But he didn’t.\n\nInstead, Barkley emphasized that comparing is never simple. Sure, some elements of basketball have remained the same: five players on a court playing the same positions, with the same scoring rules. Yet, much has changed. The league has grown, social media exploded, rules concerning fouls have evolved, and technology has transformed how teams use stats and rehab players.\n\nBarkley highlighted that while there’s often tension between current and former players, there’s also room for mutual learning.\n\nNow, why does this matter?\n\nI’ve been working on a passion project with a dear friend, focused on providing military field leaders with new resources during crucial roles like command. We’ve reached out to previous leaders for support, and their responses have been mixed. Some say, “I made it through command without those resources; they’ll just need to toughen up.” Others argue, “Without data proving these leaders need more, why invest further?” And then some simply ask, “What do you mean?”\n\nHere’s where I pull out my sports analogy: while former leaders navigated the same “game” of command, some variables have changed. These experienced leaders can offer invaluable advice, but they must recognize that new strategies and resources are available today.\n\nConsider this: an athlete suffers a knee injury.\n\nTen years ago, rehab primarily involved rest, basic physical therapy, and progressive strength training. Today, rehab is much more sophisticated. With advancements in sports medicine, we now have personalized, data-driven protocols, regenerative therapies like platelet-rich plasma treatments, and advanced techniques such as blood flow restriction training. Recovery now also emphasizes mental resilience and injury prevention through biomechanical assessments.\n\nSame knee injury, but drastically different approaches. A current athlete can still learn from a retired one about mental toughness and discipline, but why would they rely on outdated rehab techniques?\n\nLikewise, I’m challenged daily in our ever-changing world to reflect on how I approach problems. Am I open to evolving? I went to school for 8 hours a day—do my children need to? I once did ____ to achieve success, but is there a better method now?\n\nThe truth is, asking “Who is better?”—especially when comparing across generations—might be fun, but it’s not necessarily productive. A more useful approach might be to ask:\n\n• What new developments in my industry could benefit the next generation?\n\n• How can previous experiences inform current challenges, without resisting modern innovations?\n\n• What mindset shifts must I embrace to stay relevant and impactful?\n\n\n\nUltimately, growth happens when we stop clinging to the past and start combining its wisdom with the innovations of the present.\n\nWith Love,\n\nLiz\n\n\n\nThe Heart Behind Buffalo & Banyan\n\nAdult Learning\n\nCheck out our Handles\n\nBUFFALO AND BANYAN\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn commissions from qualifying purchases.

Jordan is known for his killer instinct, clutch performances, and six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls.

His ability to score from anywhere on the court, whether it be driving to the basket, hitting mid-range jumpers, or sinking three-pointers, made him a nightmare for defenders. Jordan's scoring prowess was highlighted by his six NBA scoring titles and ten scoring titles in the playoffs. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility as a scorer. While he may not have the same killer instinct as Jordan, LeBron is able to score in a variety of ways, using his size and strength to overpower defenders in the paint or his shooting touch to knock down shots from beyond the arc.\n\nDefense\n\nWhen it comes to defense, Michael Jordan was a tenacious and lockdown defender. His ability to disrupt passing lanes, block shots, and shut down opposing players made him a nine-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. Jordan's defensive prowess was also highlighted by his 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year award. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility on the defensive end. While he may not have the same defensive accolades as Jordan, LeBron is able to guard multiple positions and make game-changing plays on defense, such as chase-down blocks and steals in crucial moments.\n\nLeadership\n\nMichael Jordan was known for his fierce competitiveness and his ability to lead his team to victory. His leadership on the court was evident in his six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, where he was named NBA Finals MVP in all six appearances. Jordan's will to win and his ability to elevate his teammates made him one of the greatest leaders in NBA history. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his leadership both on and off the court. LeBron has led multiple teams to NBA championships and has been praised for his ability to empower his teammates and make everyone around him better. His leadership style is more inclusive and collaborative compared to Jordan's more demanding and intense approach.\n\nClutch Factor\n\nWhen it comes to clutch performances, Michael Jordan is often considered the greatest of all time. His ability to rise to the occasion in crucial moments, such as hitting game-winning shots in the playoffs, earned him the nickname \"The Clutch Man.\" Jordan's killer instinct and confidence in high-pressure situations made him a feared opponent in clutch moments. LeBron James, on the other hand, has also had his fair share of clutch moments throughout his career. While he may not have the same number of game-winning shots as Jordan, LeBron has shown time and time again that he can deliver in clutch situations, whether it be scoring the final points or making a crucial defensive stop.\n\nLegacy\n\nMichael Jordan's legacy in the NBA is unparalleled. His six NBA championships, five NBA MVP awards, and numerous scoring titles solidify his place as one of the greatest players of all time. Jordan's impact on the game of basketball goes beyond his on-court accomplishments, as he helped popularize the sport globally and became a cultural icon. LeBron James, on the other hand, is still building his legacy in the NBA. With multiple NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, and countless All-Star selections, LeBron has already cemented his place among the all-time greats. His impact on and off the court has made him a role model for aspiring basketball players and a respected figure in the sports world.\n\nComparisons may contain inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James and Michael Jordan became the NBA's greatest players with a leadership style that differed in a key way\n\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan have both achieved success at the highest levels in the NBA, and their methods of getting their haven't been entirely different.\n\nAs covered in ESPN's docuseries \"The Last Dance\" on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, Jordan could be a ruthless leader. Teammates admitted to fearing Jordan, who would trash-talk, belittle, and criticize players to motivate them.\n\nJames is known as a tireless worker, like Jordan, who can be hard on teammates but generally uses a kinder, more positive method off the court to get there.\n\nJordan tested teammates while James forges bonds\n\nThe stories of Jordan's intensity have become legendary. Insider spoke to NBA agent B.J. Armstrong, who played with Jordan and the Bulls from 1989 to 1995, and asked whether Jordan was as intense as has been depicted.\n\n\"Was he like that every day? Yes,\" said Armstrong. \"He was like that every day.\"\n\nSteve Kerr, who played with Jordan during the Bulls' second \"three-peat\" from 1995 to 1998, told Bill Simmons that Jordan's philosophy was to harden players to prepare them for the biggest moments.\n\n\"You knew he was going to be harsh on you. You knew he was going to be tough on you, was going to talk trash to everybody in practice, test you,\" Kerr said. \"And his reasoning was: If you couldn't handle the trash talk in practice, there's no way you could handle the pressure of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"It made perfect sense. He was right!\"\n\nMeanwhile, James' philosophy has been to befriend teammates off the floor so that they know his on-court critiques aren't personal, former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson told ESPN in 2017.\n\n\"I think LeBron, being such a good teammate, understands the aspect of, 'The more I can have a personal relationship with guys, the more I can get on them, the more I can pull from them, and the more I can expect from them. And they'll know that it's never just about me,'\" Jefferson said.\n\nHe said James goes above and beyond to keep teammates together off the court and strengthen relationships.\n\n\"The amount of time he spends being great with lifting and shooting and training, he is as equal when it comes to spending time trying to be a good teammate,\" Jefferson said. \"Having people over to his house for dinner, throwing a Christmas party or a Halloween party, having guys orchestrating a dinner here or a movie night here. He spends as much time trying to be great on the court as he does trying to make sure that the team is a cohesive unit off the court.\"\n\nJordan and James earned their stripes by out-working everyone\n\nArmstrong told Insider that Jordan's methods of leadership worked because Jordan worked harder than everybody else.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be the leader, but the only way you can lead is, the people got to follow,\" Armstrong said. \"There has to be some relationship there. That's what made him special. He wasn't going to ask you to do anything that he wasn't willing to do himself.\n\nArmstrong added: \"No one can deny one thing: he only wanted to win. He didn't have another agenda.\"\n\nIn \"The Last Dance,\" Jordan addressed his reputation for being tough on teammates. Jordan said his teammates could never say that he asked them to do something he wouldn't do himself. As Jordan spoke, a clip played of him beating other Bulls players in wind sprints.\n\n\"That man was 30-something-years old, still winning the drills!\" Armstrong said. \"You understand what I'm saying? The level of conditioning — look, when you get to be that age, I don't think the coaches or anybody are expecting you to still win the drills. He's not only winning the drills. He's talking trash to everybody. So this is what I'm saying — he's not asking you, he's not saying, 'Do as I say and not as I do.' No. 'I'm doing this.'\"\n\nJefferson said James' work ethic in training was unparalleled.\n\n\"His approach to the game — a lot of people don't see how hard he works,\" Jefferson said. \"Being in the weight room, the training regimen that he has — I've never seen it. I can honestly say that.\"\n\nFormer Cavs teammate Iman Shumpert told Complex in 2017 that James puts his training and body care above everything else.\n\n\"He just takes care of his body,\" Shumpert said. \"He's got his trainers there. He put that ice on right after the game — he gonna sit there.\n\n\"Like, people may think it's diva-ish, but that man will get his treatment and be late. 'I'll be late to this event, even though y'all paid me all this money to be here. Because I gotta do everything I gotta do to make sure I preserve my body so I can do this tomorrow.'\"\n\nJames told Business Insider in 2016 that he believed he had to set an example for teammates by putting in the work himself.\n\n\"I don't just talk about it — I actually do it as well,\" James said. \"When you're able to come through on your word, it allows the guys that you're leading, male or female, to be able to say, 'OK. We can follow this person because he won't let us down. No matter if it's going good or bad.'\"\n\nWhat were they like off the court?\n\nTraining and basketball is only part of the equation. NBA players spend a lot of time off the court together, and that relationship can matter to team success.\n\nAs Jefferson said, James puts in extra effort to throwing parties and team outings to keep players close to one another.\n\nAnthony Davis, who was traded to the Lakers in the summer of 2019, told The Athletic that James is like a kid off the court, always having fun, setting up events, and making teammates laugh.\n\n\"You wouldn't know it unless you're his teammate or you're around him a lot, but he's a big kid,\" Davis said. \"He's high on life, loves life, lives his life to the fullest. I get to see that every day. Win, lose or draw, he's got a smile on his face ... He's always setting up team dinners. He's about the team, and he's always making us laugh.\"\n\nThough James' efforts to be friendly to teammates have received praise, Armstrong cautioned about drawing a straight line between team success and off-court friendship.\n\n\"We didn't have to hang out,\" Armstrong said of his Bulls teams. \"Not that we didn't hang out, you know, we were a very close group. But just because you hang out doesn't necessarily mean that that's a close team or close group or what have you.\"\n\nArmstrong said Jordan wasn't the type to organize team dinners or group outings like James does. However, Armstrong said the Bulls teams were full of \"truth-tellers\" — a necessary component to a successful team.\n\n\"You have to tell each other your truth because if you don't, then there is something missing where you don't feel comfortable, or that other person doesn't feel comfortable with you,\" Armstrong said.\n\nStill, Armstrong said Jordan was \"one of the guys.\"\n\nArmstrong also said Jordan had a way of making anyone he met feel like a close friend.\n\n\"He has this incredible gift where he can make you feel like he's known you his entire life,\" Armstrong said. \"Like, he just has it. He has that charisma about him that he just understands people. I don't know if that was natural or he worked on it. I have no idea, but I just knew he was always aware of what was going on around him … He relished in that. He enjoyed it.\"\n\nArmstrong added that Jordan is also very funny, with a sharp sense of humor.\n\n\"He loves being one of the guys. He loves it. That's the side that I know. I'll always remember, like, the bus rides and plane rides and all of the things like that, because he's really funny.\"\n\nDownfalls to their leadership styles?\n\nJordan and James' high expectations could also make it challenging to play with them.\n\nKerr told Simmons that at times it felt like he was playing for Jordan, rather than with him.\n\nJordan has also been accused of alienating teammates. Former Bulls forward Horace Grant has said he and Jordan were not particularly close off the floor.\n\nSam Smith, the author of the famed book \"Jordan Rules,\" recently said on a KNBR podcast that Bulls players used to tell him that Jordan would deny Grant food after bad games.\n\n\"Players would come to me over the years and said, 'You know what he did? He took Horace [Grant's] food away on the plane because Horace had a bad game.' [Michael] told the stewardesses, 'Don't feed him, he doesn't deserve to eat,'\" Smith said.\n\nFormer Bulls assistant coach Tex Winter told Michael Leahy in the 2004 book \"When Nothing Else Matters,\" that Jordan could be too tough on teammates and that those methods didn't always pay off. Winter said some teammates \"resented\" the way Jordan treated them (via CBS's James Herbert).\n\nJames has also been accused of alienating teammates. In the 2018-19 season, his first with the Lakers, James was criticized for distancing himself from his younger teammates. During a bad loss to the Indiana Pacers, James was seen sitting several seats away from his teammates, many of whom were in trade rumors.\n\nESPN's Dave McMenamin reported in 2019 that Lakers players even called James out for his poor body language that season.\n\n\"[James] copped to the critique, telling his teammates that, in essence, cutting out behavior like slumped shoulders and sideways glances has been something he has tried to work on his entire career,\" McMenamin wrote.\n\nTeammates would go to battle with Jordan and James all over again\n\nThough neither are perfect in their leadership habits, many players have come away impressed by how both players approached the game.\n\nJefferson said James' willingness to shoulder the burden of leading the team impressed him.\n\n\"Not many people in the history of sports have said, 'Everyone get on my back,'\" Jefferson told ESPN. \"The city, state, organization, team … 'Get on my back. If we win or fail, I'll take the blame — but I'm going to lead you.'\n\n\"How many people have ever said that? I can't think of too many players who have put that type of pressure on themselves and then have delivered more times than not. And he embraces it.\"\n\nKyrie Irving, who later requested a trade from the Cavs to get out from under James' shadow, said after the 2017 Finals that learning from James changed his career.\n\n\"Man, he's freaking awesome,\" Irving told reporters. \"As a student of the game, it would be a disservice to myself if I didn't try to learn as much as possible while I'm playing with this guy. Every single day demanding more out of himself, demanding more out of us, the true testament of a consummate professional.\"\n\nIrving added: \"That's the type of guy that I want to be with every single time I'm going to war, because I know what to expect, and you stand your ground, too, with a leader like that.\"\n\nSimilarly, Armstrong marveled at the way Jordan rose to the occasion.\n\n\"You had no doubt that when he fell down, he was going to get back up,\" Armstrong said. \"And that was the thing that I admired most about him is every single thing he did. He was going to try his absolute best.\n\n\"How many people can say that? ... That was the lesson that I picked up very quickly from him, is I can try to be my very best every single time I do something, whatever the outcome is, I can live with the outcome. But what I can't live with is not doing my very best.\"\n\nRecommended video\n\nRead next\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nJump to\n\n"

            "raw_content": "POPULAR SEARCHES\n\nBROWSE BY\n\nOld School vs. New School: How Jordan's and LeBron's leadership styles differ\n\nBy Melissa RohlinFOX Sports NBA reporter\n\nMichael Jordan and LeBron James have a lot in common.\n\nThey're two of the greatest basketball players of all time. They revolutionized the game. They inspired everyone around them.\n\nBut the ways they went about that differ tremendously.\n\nWhile Jordan was a ruthless leader, James has a gentler approach, often befriending his teammates and learning how to get through to them.\n\nScott Williams is one of four players who played alongside both, winning three championships with Jordan on the Chicago Bulls from 1990 to '93 and spending one season with James on the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2004-05.\n\nWilliams describes Jordan as having only one gear.\n\n\"I had him before he had a ring, so it was crazy intense, like scary intense,\" Williams told FOX Sports. \"It was almost an illness how hard he went at everything, including teammates, verbally and physically.\n\n\"Going to Bulls practices was similar to going to war. You're going to get hurt. And if you don't give your all at every moment, you're not going to survive.\"\n\nJordan wanted to play alongside guys who operated at a feverish pitch. If a player fell short of his lofty expectations, he wouldn't necessarily go to management and request the player be traded, but Jordan would make the player's life miserable on the court through a combination of verbal and physical assaults, leaving management no choice but to deal the player to another team.\n\nWilliams witnessed that phenomenon firsthand.\n\n\"One of the saddest things I ever saw in my pro career was watching him go against Dennis Hopson every day,\" Williams said of the shooting guard/small forward who played for the Bulls in 1990-91 before being traded after two games the following season. \"Hop was a good guy, but Hop was about the cars and the lifestyle and the parties and the girls. And Michael wasn't having any of that. He went at him so hard every day, Hop was a shell of himself by the time the season was over. They had to trade him.\"\n\nWilliams, who was undrafted out of the University of North Carolina in 1990, earned Jordan's respect with his work ethic and willingness to stand up to him.\n\nThey'd often play one-on-one after practice because Jordan, who was 6-foot-6, wanted to improve his low-post scoring game against taller defenders. After marathon practices, the 6-foot-10 Williams would spend hours exchanging trash talk and banging elbows and hips with the best player in the world, quickly learning their relationship worked only if he returned Jordan's physicality with forearm shivers of his own.\n\nThose matchups made Williams quicker and improved his instincts, and he had an enduring, 15-season professional career as a journeyman with the Bulls, Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Cavaliers.\n\nWilliams, who is now a color analyst for the Grand Canyon Antelope men's basketball team, said playing with Jordan wasn't always fun. But every June, he felt as though all of the blood, sweat, tears, bruises and loose teeth were worth it.\n\nAnd he said it prepared him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the result of when you survive stuff like that, you realize that anything else in life is easy,\" he said. \"Anything else after that is just easier. There's nothing else I've ever faced in life where I've thought, 'Wow, this is hard work.'\"\n\nJames has a very different modus operandi.\n\nWhile Jordan had only one mode, James has many. He's vocal but can communicate just as effectively with silence or body language. He can be positive and supportive. Other times, he screams and voices his frustration. He picks and chooses when he approaches guys, sometimes opting to do so on the court in front of other players and other times over private dinners.\n\nJames tailors his approach to the specific player.\n\nTo Lakers forward Jared Dudley, a 14-year veteran who has played alongside Steve Nash, Grant Hill, Chris Paul and Shaquille O'Neal, James' leadership style is different than anybody else's.\n\nJames, Dudley says, inspires players to work harder.\n\n\"LeBron is very unique where he's a guy's guy,\" Dudley said. \"He'll drink some wine with you. He'll have a one-on-one talk with you. And guys have looked up to him for a long time. So his words of encouragement, he knows what to say at the right time. He knows when to get on you.\n\n\"Let's be real, when you see LeBron's body language, it isn't high when he's frustrated or mad. And they know that. In a way, you want to play well for him, play well for yourself, because you know how [much work] he puts into his craft. You see what he does. You don't want to let him, yourself and [the] Lakers down.\"\n\nSince James joined the Lakers in free agency in 2018, he has promoted a feeling of inclusivity and acceptance in the locker room. He invited his teammates to his 35th birthday party in West Hollywood last season. He mentored reserve guard Quinn Cook. He made former Laker Dwight Howard feel at home in a locker room that was hostile to him seven years earlier. He has hosted Lakers superstar Anthony Davis for dinners at his home with his family.\n\nJames' leadership was pivotal to the Lakers' success last season, especially for Davis.\n\nDavis, who had never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, can be hard on himself. He's a perfectionist who can sink into a funk when he isn't playing up to his standards.\n\nJames learned to read Davis' body language and determine whether he needed a pep talk or space in those moments. When the timing was right, James would urge Davis to move forward and stop dwelling on the past.\n\nDavis said it made a huge difference for him.\n\n\"He’s like a bigger brother to me and helped me with things I need help with, on and off the floor,\" Davis said. \"So it’s been great to have him around and being able to call, text him whenever I need more support on anything, mainly on just trying to figure out everything. So it's been good just having him around. If he see things, he helps me. And if I have questions about anything, he’s always there picking up his phone or responding to a text to help me out.\"\n\nThat's not to say James isn't intense.\n\nJames has had yelling matches on the court with teammates. Earlier in his career, he sometimes used social media to send cryptic messages, famously tweeting in 2015, \"Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT and just FIT-IN,\" a note he later acknowledged was directed at his former Cavaliers teammate Kevin Love, among others.\n\nAt this stage of James' career, however, there's one thing that stands out to Lakers coach Frank Vogel: his approachability.\n\nIn the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida, where the Lakers spent nearly 100 days before winning their 17th NBA championship last fall, Vogel marveled at how accessible James made himself.\n\n\"On a regular basis, he’s down there eating with his teammates and being with his teammates, which is something you don’t always say about players of his caliber,\" Vogel said. \"I can’t say enough positive things about him as a leader and what he means to our franchise.\"\n\nJames' leadership style has changed throughout the years. When he entered the league at age 18 as the No. 1 pick by the Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA Draft, his approach was to observe what leadership traits worked best.\n\n\"You come into a professional league, you sit there, and you watch,\" James said. \"You become a sponge, and you see. You lead by example, you go out, and you practice hard and stick your head into film and try to get better every single day and just try to keep quiet because there are vets and things of that nature. You've got your coaching staff that does a lot of the talking. I was more of a sponge at 18, just watching, seeing.\"\n\nWilliams played with James during his second season in the NBA and was immediately impressed by his approach.\n\nJames befriended his older teammates, playing cards with them on flights. He asked Williams questions about Jordan and the Bulls, something other young players — perhaps surprisingly — failed to do. And he demonstrated an indefatigable work ethic.\n\n\"The kid worked hard,\" Williams said. \"He was a gym rat, whether it be in the weight room getting strong, which he was already pretty darn strong as a 19-year-old, but working on his outside shooting, his footwork. I think he wanted to show the guys that I'm here every day giving it my all. I expect everybody to do the same. So it wasn't so much what he talked about, it was what he demonstrated.\"\n\nJames became much more vocal over his next few years in the league, a transformation Williams witnessed after retiring in 2004 and becoming a color analyst for the Cavaliers who often attended team practices.\n\nJames went on to lead the Miami Heat to two championships in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers to a championship in 2016 and the Lakers to their first title in a decade last season.\n\n\"He's a world-class leader,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who guided James from 2010 to 2014. \"He's always had instincts to lead, and now he's really made it an art. It's a competitive advantage, his leadership, and he's developed it each year that he's been in this league. And he's utilizing it more and more and more to have that multiplying effect.\"\n\nJames' leadership was never more on display it was than during the 2016 NBA Finals, when he helped the Cavaliers overcome a 3-1 series deficit against the Warriors to win the franchise's first title.\n\nTyronn Lue, who coached James during that time and played alongside Jordan in his final two seasons on the Washington Wizards from 2001 to '03, said the two men are much more alike than different.\n\nWhen asked to compare their leadership styles, Lue didn't hesitate.\n\n\"The same,\" said Lue, who now coaches the LA Clippers. \"I think they both wanted to win and would do anything it took to win.\"\n\nBoth players got the results they wanted.\n\nJordan won six championships. James trails him by two rings, but he is played arguably the best basketball of his career at age 36 for a Lakers team poised to compete for another title this season.\n\nPlaying alongside either of them is something teammates will never forget.\n\nWhen asked if he'd want his children to play with Jordan, Williams reluctantly said yes.\n\nIt was impossibly tough, too tough – but it changed his life.\n\n\"He looked out for me,\" Williams said. \"He got me my shoe contract at Nike. He didn't stop the vets from getting on me, but he made sure it didn't go too far. There was a little-big brother kind of thing there. But he also knew I needed to take my floaties off and be able to swim in the deep end.\"\n\nAs for Davis, he still sometimes has \"pinch me\" moments about being teammates with James.\n\nA big one came last postseason\n\nWhen the Lakers were on a team bus headed to a game, Davis came across a social media post that showed James in the top three all time of many major statistical categories. Davis, who attended James' basketball camp in Ohio when he was 15 years old, couldn't help but marvel at the fact that they were now competing for a championship together, and he decided to pour his heart out in a text to James, telling him how much he has inspired him throughout his career.\n\nImmediately after sending it, Davis became a bit worried.\n\n\"It felt kinda awkward to walk in the locker room, like, sending a heartfelt message to him, and now we're about to go play, and we're right next to each other,\" Davis said. \"I'm like, 'Damn, what's he gonna say?' 'Man, you soft,' or, 'You gonna send this before a game?' So it was kinda weird.\"\n\nBut James didn't say a word at the time.\n\nHe waited until after the game to acknowledge the text, knowing anything else would've embarrassed his teammate before an important game.\n\nFor James, being a leader is a delicate dance. It's something that requires patience and impeccable timing.\n\nEven though he's in the twilight of his career, it's still one of the most important aspects of his game that he continually works on.\n\n\"Leadership is not a one-day thing, not a one-trick pony,\" he said. \"It's an everyday thing, both on and off the floor. And I take full responsibility for that.\"\n\nMelissa Rohlin is an NBA reporter for FOX Sports.

            "raw_content": "5 ways LeBron James has made a huge impact off the court\n\n\n\nChristian Alamodin\n\nLeBron James is one of the best basketball players to ever step on the court. He's completely transformed the sport since his NBA debut in 2003, with similar players following in his footsteps since.\n\nWhat makes LeBron James a very interesting player to see is how vocal and influential he is off the court as well.\n\nThere have been plenty of instances where the King showed everyone just how influential he can be. Here are five ways LeBron James made his presence felt throughout the league.\n\nThe financial boom he brings to cities\n\nLeBron James is not just a player, but he is also a big brand. He's got the Midas touch. His talent and charisma make him one of the most sought-after athletes in the world, and companies are always at his door, looking to cash in on his brand.\n\nIn fact, cities that were in contention for the LeBron James Sweepstakes in 2018 weren't only anticipating his arrival in terms of his talent to dribble the ball.\n\nIt was revealed by Selena Hill of Black Enterprise that cities would feel a massive boost to their books, with New York getting a $1.7 billion boost to their economy if he made the move to the Big Apple.\n\nMoreover, Fortune's Sarah Gray revealed that James's arrival to the City of Angels would be bringing up to $400,000,000 in profit for the city and create up to 3,000 jobs in the food industry, as establishments within a mile of Staples Center would pop up like mushrooms.\n\nJames knows that Black Lives Matter\n\nGrowing up under duress in Akron, OH, James knew how tough a rough background can be. He also understands that the system as it is now is not working fairly for people of color.\n\nJames has been a staunch critic of police brutality against African Americans and called for accountability on the police force. Moreover, he's not shy to tackle the racism he and his people are facing every day.\n\nWhile he's been told by analysts to shut up and dribble, he's not afraid to use his privilege as an NBA superstar to bring up racial injustices.\n\n“I know there’s a lot of tragic things happening in Charlottesville,” James says, per CNBC's Ruth Umoh. “I have this platform, and I’m somebody that has a voice of command, and the only way for us to get better as a society and for us to get better as people is love. And that’s the only way we’re going to be able to conquer something as one.”\n\nJames speaks up on national issues\n\nJames' opinions aren't limited to racial injustices. He also takes an active stand on national policy, not afraid to let his opinions on politics and pressing national issues be heard.\n\nHe's not afraid to call out people who he thinks are acting like a bum. He was very involved in the 2016 campaign of Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. He happily gave his opinion on any social issues that transcended the basketball court.\n\nThe greatest thing about LeBron James speaking up is that he made it okay for the rest of the league to let their opinions be known about social issues. He helped the NBA become one of the most socially involved professional sports league in the United States.\n\nHis continuous philanthropy to his native Ohio\n\nLBJ may have traded the Cavalier wine for the Laker gold, but they can never take away the Akron out of the man. His charity, the LeBron James Family Foundation, is continuously involved in the community.\n\nJames commits a certain amount of his money in ensuring that the kids in the community get programs and initiatives that will help them grow up in a kinder and more holistic environment.\n\nThe biggest project of his foundation yet is the I PROMISE Institute.\n\nJames is a perfect role model for young kids to aspire to be\n\nJames made a few questionable basketball decisions in his career.\n\nHe's married to his high school sweetheart and has three kids with her. He's visible and involved in his children's lives, and his support for his son's blossoming basketball career is nothing short of adorable.\n\nHe doesn't forget his roots and is always involved in his hometown. He also shows his intelligence as he's not afraid to talk about politics. He's presented himself as a well-rounded person who has done a lot of right things. He's a perfect role model for kids to follow.\n\nChristian Alamodin is a writer for ClutchPoints.\n\n🚨 Get viral NBA graphics, memes, rumors and trending news\n    delivered right to your inbox with the Clutch Newsletter.\n\n"

The off-court achievement that James is most proud of, he says, is working to uplift the lives of people like Smiley in his hometown of Akron.\n\nMany athletes have excelled in one or more of these areas. But few have done all of them as well as James, who is closing in on passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA’s career scoring record.\n\n“His goal, I believe, is to have 10% of his wealth go to causes and support communities, which is an amazing goal,” said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, a professor of sports management at George Washington University. “I would say he’s maybe above and beyond others, just on that aspiration alone.”\n\nJames is, by any measure, an overwhelming success. And he makes Smiley — one of the many people in Akron who have received financial support from his foundation — believe that she can be a success as well.\n\n“If I did not have the LeBron program, I probably wouldn’t have ever gone to college. I would be living in a not-so-positive environment,” said the 19-year-old Smiley.\n\n“His ability to help people’s futures,” she added, “is what makes LeBron a great person.”\n\nJames, who entered the NBA straight after high school in 2003, planned early on to use his talents, fame — and, yes, his growing financial resources — to have on impact on the world beyond basketball.\n\n“Even before I got into the NBA, I knew I wanted to find a way to give back to my community,” said James. Although James bounced from home to home during his childhood, and experienced financial insecurity for many of those years, he also was given enormous support from friends, neighbors and educators.\n\nThe LeBron James Family Foundation, founded in 2004, at first gained local attention by giving away bikes and backpacks. Then it began looking at after-school programs, with students scattered across several dozen schools, and eventually created a public school currently serving about 575 third through eighth graders. Today the school includes a family resource center that provides a wide-range of services to parents, including mental health, financial literacy, legal aid and GED courses.\n\nJust down the street from the school, the foundation provides rent-free housing to as many as 16 different families — when needed — and it has plans to build 50 units of affordable housing.\n\n“I couldn’t have guessed how much it would grow,” James said in late January. “But we got here by listening and responding to our community and what they need.”\n\nJames has made over $400 million in NBA salary during his time with Cleveland, Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. Another $100 million is on the way in the next 2-1/2 years or so.\n\nJames is a pitchman for Nike, GMC, AT&T and many more multinational companies. He owns a piece of the Boston Red Sox and Britain’s Liverpool football club. His entertainment company, SpringHill — named after the modest apartment complex he grew up in — is valued at $725 million and has produced movies for HBO and Netflix.\n\n“He’s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven’t had the same advantages as others,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said in 2018, a sentiment he’s repeated many times since. “They see in this guy somebody who has consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace and gives them a voice and lets them know that you can speak about anything.”\n\nJames puts so much focus on giving back to Akron because of the help people there gave to him and his family. “He’s never lost sight of that,” said Michele Campbell, the executive director of James’ foundation. “I think that keeps him grounded.”\n\nJust how down to earth “King James” really was got called into question in 2010. That’s when he went on television to announce that he was leaving Cleveland to play in Miami. Billed as “The Decision” — and broadcast on ESPN — the live event was widely ripped as egotistical. But from James’ perspective, the broadcast raised around $4 million for charity, a fact that was largely overlooked.\n\nJust a couple of years later, James would use his star power to help draw attention to a cause bigger than himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin — a Black Florida teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer — James tweeted a photo of Heat players wearing hoodies and bowing their heads that included the hashtag “WeWantJustice.”\n\nIn 2020, James helped lead the “More Than A Vote” movement, which included registration and early-vote drives and stressed the need for people — particularly Black voters — to get to the polls to fight disenfranchisement.\n\nAlso in 2020, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, James was one of the players calling for an end to racial inequality and police brutality.\n\n“Everything I do,” James said late last year, “has to have a purpose.”\n\nJames has all the money and all the fame that he ever wanted or needed. His NBA records, including the scoring title, are going to last for a very long time.\n\nAs will his off-court endeavors.\n\n“His ability to help others and put others first is what makes him a great person,” Smiley said. “Not the baskets he shot.”\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC\n\n"

I gotta get to the locker room to start my process to get ready for the next game.\n\n\"I'll be sitting in the locker room, foot on an ice bag, ice bags on. I got my smoothie and my fruit, and I'm already getting to it right now. ... During a loss they was like, 'Oh, he's a poor sport.' Like, he's leaving the court. ... And then they start seeing me doing it during the wins and they was like, 'He's got no sportsmanship!'\"\n\nEvery second counts for @KingJames. ðªð¾Episode 2 is out now: https://t.co/pwk8BEr2F6 pic.twitter.com/ouYGmkl7AS\n\nThere are exceptions, of course, as James was recently seen dapping up Steph Curry and Jimmy Butler following the Lakers' loss to the Golden State Warriors last week. Even with The King's unmatched stamina and durability throughout his 22 years and counting in the league, it makes sense that sometimes he just wants to go home and rest his feet after a grueling game.\n\nMore NBA on Sports Illustrated\n\nfeed\n\nKristen Wong is a staff writer on the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.
