        "raw_content": "What Questions Automatically Spark a Debate?\n\nRecently, I watched a podcast called Club Shay Shay where Shannon Sharpe (3X Super Bowl NFL champ) and Charles Barkley (former NBA power forward) debated the difference between 1990s basketball players and current NBA players. For those not into sports, hang in there.\n\nHumans love to compare. Celebrity magazines ask, “Who wore this dress better?” Smartphone users debate, “Apple or Android?” (Is there really a comparison?) With the U.S. elections approaching… well, let’s not go there! But in the podcast, the question was:\n\nWho is the better basketball player, Michael Jordan or LeBron James?\n\nI rolled my eyes, expecting Charles Barkley to glorify the good ole days of “real basketball.” He could’ve used stats or stories to stand his ground. But he didn’t.\n\nInstead, Barkley emphasized that comparing is never simple. Sure, some elements of basketball have remained the same: five players on a court playing the same positions, with the same scoring rules. Yet, much has changed. The league has grown, social media exploded, rules concerning fouls have evolved, and technology has transformed how teams use stats and rehab players.\n\nBarkley highlighted that while there’s often tension between current and former players, there’s also room for mutual learning.\n\nNow, why does this matter?\n\nI’ve been working on a passion project with a dear friend, focused on providing military field leaders with new resources during crucial roles like command. We’ve reached out to previous leaders for support, and their responses have been mixed. Some say, “I made it through command without those resources; they’ll just need to toughen up.” Others argue, “Without data proving these leaders need more, why invest further?” And then some simply ask, “What do you mean?”\n\nHere’s where I pull out my sports analogy: while former leaders navigated the same “game” of command, some variables have changed. These experienced leaders can offer invaluable advice, but they must recognize that new strategies and resources are available today.\n\nConsider this: an athlete suffers a knee injury.\n\nTen years ago, rehab primarily involved rest, basic physical therapy, and progressive strength training. Today, rehab is much more sophisticated. With advancements in sports medicine, we now have personalized, data-driven protocols, regenerative therapies like platelet-rich plasma treatments, and advanced techniques such as blood flow restriction training. Recovery now also emphasizes mental resilience and injury prevention through biomechanical assessments.\n\nSame knee injury, but drastically different approaches. A current athlete can still learn from a retired one about mental toughness and discipline, but why would they rely on outdated rehab techniques?\n\nLikewise, I’m challenged daily in our ever-changing world to reflect on how I approach problems. Am I open to evolving? I went to school for 8 hours a day—do my children need to? I once did ____ to achieve success, but is there a better method now?\n\nThe truth is, asking “Who is better?”—especially when comparing across generations—might be fun, but it’s not necessarily productive. A more useful approach might be to ask:\n\n• What new developments in my industry could benefit the next generation?\n\n• How can previous experiences inform current challenges, without resisting modern innovations?\n\n• What mindset shifts must I embrace to stay relevant and impactful?\n\n\n\nUltimately, growth happens when we stop clinging to the past and start combining its wisdom with the innovations of the present.\n\nWith Love,\n\nLiz\n\n\n\nThe Heart Behind Buffalo & Banyan\n\nAdult Learning\n\nCheck out our Handles\n\nBUFFALO AND BANYAN\n\nDisclaimer: As an Amazon Associate, I earn commissions from qualifying purchases.

        "raw_content": "Jordan vs. LeBron\n\nWhat's the Difference?\n\nJordan and LeBron are two of the greatest basketball players of all time, each leaving a lasting impact on the game. Jordan is known for his killer instinct, clutch performances, and six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. LeBron, on the other hand, is known for his versatility, basketball IQ, and ability to elevate his teammates. While Jordan is often considered the greatest of all time, LeBron's longevity and consistency have solidified his place in the GOAT conversation as well. Both players have redefined the game in their own ways and will forever be remembered as legends of the sport.\n\nComparison\n\nAttribute | Jordan | LeBron\nChampionships | 6 | 4\nScoring Titles | 10 | 1\nRegular Season MVPs | 5 | 4\nFinals MVPs | 6 | 4\nAll-Star Appearances | 14 | 17\nFurther Detail\n\nScoring Ability\n\nMichael Jordan is widely regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. His ability to score from anywhere on the court, whether it be driving to the basket, hitting mid-range jumpers, or sinking three-pointers, made him a nightmare for defenders. Jordan's scoring prowess was highlighted by his six NBA scoring titles and ten scoring titles in the playoffs. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility as a scorer. While he may not have the same killer instinct as Jordan, LeBron is able to score in a variety of ways, using his size and strength to overpower defenders in the paint or his shooting touch to knock down shots from beyond the arc.\n\nDefense\n\nWhen it comes to defense, Michael Jordan was a tenacious and lockdown defender. His ability to disrupt passing lanes, block shots, and shut down opposing players made him a nine-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. Jordan's defensive prowess was also highlighted by his 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year award. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his versatility on the defensive end. While he may not have the same defensive accolades as Jordan, LeBron is able to guard multiple positions and make game-changing plays on defense, such as chase-down blocks and steals in crucial moments.\n\nLeadership\n\nMichael Jordan was known for his fierce competitiveness and his ability to lead his team to victory. His leadership on the court was evident in his six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls, where he was named NBA Finals MVP in all six appearances. Jordan's will to win and his ability to elevate his teammates made him one of the greatest leaders in NBA history. LeBron James, on the other hand, is known for his leadership both on and off the court. LeBron has led multiple teams to NBA championships and has been praised for his ability to empower his teammates and make everyone around him better. His leadership style is more inclusive and collaborative compared to Jordan's more demanding and intense approach.\n\nClutch Factor\n\nWhen it comes to clutch performances, Michael Jordan is often considered the greatest of all time. His ability to rise to the occasion in crucial moments, such as hitting game-winning shots in the playoffs, earned him the nickname \"The Clutch Man.\" Jordan's killer instinct and confidence in high-pressure situations made him a feared opponent in clutch moments. LeBron James, on the other hand, has also had his fair share of clutch moments throughout his career. While he may not have the same number of game-winning shots as Jordan, LeBron has shown time and time again that he can deliver in clutch situations, whether it be scoring the final points or making a crucial defensive stop.\n\nLegacy\n\nMichael Jordan's legacy in the NBA is unparalleled. His six NBA championships, five NBA MVP awards, and numerous scoring titles solidify his place as one of the greatest players of all time. Jordan's impact on the game of basketball goes beyond his on-court accomplishments, as he helped popularize the sport globally and became a cultural icon. LeBron James, on the other hand, is still building his legacy in the NBA. With multiple NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, and countless All-Star selections, LeBron has already cemented his place among the all-time greats. His impact on and off the court has made him a role model for aspiring basketball players and a respected figure in the sports world.\n\nComparisons may contain inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.

        "raw_content": "LeBron James and Michael Jordan became the NBA's greatest players with a leadership style that differed in a key way\n\nLeBron James and Michael Jordan have both achieved success at the highest levels in the NBA, and their methods of getting their haven't been entirely different.\n\nAs covered in ESPN's docuseries \"The Last Dance\" on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, Jordan could be a ruthless leader. Teammates admitted to fearing Jordan, who would trash-talk, belittle, and criticize players to motivate them.\n\nJames is known as a tireless worker, like Jordan, who can be hard on teammates but generally uses a kinder, more positive method off the court to get there.\n\nJordan tested teammates while James forges bonds\n\nThe stories of Jordan's intensity have become legendary. Insider spoke to NBA agent B.J. Armstrong, who played with Jordan and the Bulls from 1989 to 1995, and asked whether Jordan was as intense as has been depicted.\n\n\"Was he like that every day? Yes,\" said Armstrong. \"He was like that every day.\"\n\nSteve Kerr, who played with Jordan during the Bulls' second \"three-peat\" from 1995 to 1998, told Bill Simmons that Jordan's philosophy was to harden players to prepare them for the biggest moments.\n\n\"You knew he was going to be harsh on you. You knew he was going to be tough on you, was going to talk trash to everybody in practice, test you,\" Kerr said. \"And his reasoning was: If you couldn't handle the trash talk in practice, there's no way you could handle the pressure of the NBA playoffs.\n\n\"It made perfect sense. He was right!\"\n\nMeanwhile, James' philosophy has been to befriend teammates off the floor so that they know his on-court critiques aren't personal, former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson told ESPN in 2017.\n\n\"I think LeBron, being such a good teammate, understands the aspect of, 'The more I can have a personal relationship with guys, the more I can get on them, the more I can pull from them, and the more I can expect from them. And they'll know that it's never just about me,'\" Jefferson said.\n\nHe said James goes above and beyond to keep teammates together off the court and strengthen relationships.\n\n\"The amount of time he spends being great with lifting and shooting and training, he is as equal when it comes to spending time trying to be a good teammate,\" Jefferson said. \"Having people over to his house for dinner, throwing a Christmas party or a Halloween party, having guys orchestrating a dinner here or a movie night here. He spends as much time trying to be great on the court as he does trying to make sure that the team is a cohesive unit off the court.\"\n\nJordan and James earned their stripes by out-working everyone\n\nArmstrong told Insider that Jordan's methods of leadership worked because Jordan worked harder than everybody else.\n\n\"Everybody wants to be the leader, but the only way you can lead is, the people got to follow,\" Armstrong said. \"There has to be some relationship there. That's what made him special. He wasn't going to ask you to do anything that he wasn't willing to do himself.\n\nArmstrong added: \"No one can deny one thing: he only wanted to win. He didn't have another agenda.\"\n\nIn \"The Last Dance,\" Jordan addressed his reputation for being tough on teammates. Jordan said his teammates could never say that he asked them to do something he wouldn't do himself. As Jordan spoke, a clip played of him beating other Bulls players in wind sprints.\n\n\"That man was 30-something-years old, still winning the drills!\" Armstrong said. \"You understand what I'm saying? The level of conditioning — look, when you get to be that age, I don't think the coaches or anybody are expecting you to still win the drills. He's not only winning the drills. He's talking trash to everybody. So this is what I'm saying — he's not asking you, he's not saying, 'Do as I say and not as I do.' No. 'I'm doing this.'\"\n\nJefferson said James' work ethic in training was unparalleled.\n\n\"His approach to the game — a lot of people don't see how hard he works,\" Jefferson said. \"Being in the weight room, the training regimen that he has — I've never seen it. I can honestly say that.\"\n\nFormer Cavs teammate Iman Shumpert told Complex in 2017 that James puts his training and body care above everything else.\n\n\"He just takes care of his body,\" Shumpert said. \"He's got his trainers there. He put that ice on right after the game — he gonna sit there.\n\n\"Like, people may think it's diva-ish, but that man will get his treatment and be late. 'I'll be late to this event, even though y'all paid me all this money to be here. Because I gotta do everything I gotta do to make sure I preserve my body so I can do this tomorrow.'\"\n\nJames told Business Insider in 2016 that he believed he had to set an example for teammates by putting in the work himself.\n\n\"I don't just talk about it — I actually do it as well,\" James said. \"When you're able to come through on your word, it allows the guys that you're leading, male or female, to be able to say, 'OK. We can follow this person because he won't let us down. No matter if it's going good or bad.'\"\n\nWhat were they like off the court?\n\nTraining and basketball is only part of the equation. NBA players spend a lot of time off the court together, and that relationship can matter to team success.\n\nAs Jefferson said, James puts in extra effort to throwing parties and team outings to keep players close to one another.\n\nAnthony Davis, who was traded to the Lakers in the summer of 2019, told The Athletic that James is like a kid off the court, always having fun, setting up events, and making teammates laugh.\n\n\"You wouldn't know it unless you're his teammate or you're around him a lot, but he's a big kid,\" Davis said. \"He's high on life, loves life, lives his life to the fullest. I get to see that every day. Win, lose or draw, he's got a smile on his face ... He's always setting up team dinners. He's about the team, and he's always making us laugh.\"\n\nThough James' efforts to be friendly to teammates have received praise, Armstrong cautioned about drawing a straight line between team success and off-court friendship.\n\n\"We didn't have to hang out,\" Armstrong said of his Bulls teams. \"Not that we didn't hang out, you know, we were a very close group. But just because you hang out doesn't necessarily mean that that's a close team or close group or what have you.\"\n\nArmstrong said Jordan wasn't the type to organize team dinners or group outings like James does. However, Armstrong said the Bulls teams were full of \"truth-tellers\" — a necessary component to a successful team.\n\n\"You have to tell each other your truth because if you don't, then there is something missing where you don't feel comfortable, or that other person doesn't feel comfortable with you,\" Armstrong said.\n\nStill, Armstrong said Jordan was \"one of the guys.\"\n\nArmstrong also said Jordan had a way of making anyone he met feel like a close friend.\n\n\"He has this incredible gift where he can make you feel like he's known you his entire life,\" Armstrong said. \"Like, he just has it. He has that charisma about him that he just understands people. I don't know if that was natural or he worked on it. I have no idea, but I just knew he was always aware of what was going on around him … He relished in that. He enjoyed it.\"\n\nArmstrong added that Jordan is also very funny, with a sharp sense of humor.\n\n\"He loves being one of the guys. He loves it. That's the side that I know. I'll always remember, like, the bus rides and plane rides and all of the things like that, because he's really funny.\"\n\nDownfalls to their leadership styles?\n\nJordan and James' high expectations could also make it challenging to play with them.\n\nKerr told Simmons that at times it felt like he was playing for Jordan, rather than with him.\n\nJordan has also been accused of alienating teammates. Former Bulls forward Horace Grant has said he and Jordan were not particularly close off the floor.\n\nSam Smith, the author of the famed book \"Jordan Rules,\" recently said on a KNBR podcast that Bulls players used to tell him that Jordan would deny Grant food after bad games.\n\n\"Players would come to me over the years and said, 'You know what he did? He took Horace [Grant's] food away on the plane because Horace had a bad game.' [Michael] told the stewardesses, 'Don't feed him, he doesn't deserve to eat,'\" Smith said.\n\nFormer Bulls assistant coach Tex Winter told Michael Leahy in the 2004 book \"When Nothing Else Matters,\" that Jordan could be too tough on teammates and that those methods didn't always pay off. Winter said some teammates \"resented\" the way Jordan treated them (via CBS's James Herbert).\n\nJames has also been accused of alienating teammates. In the 2018-19 season, his first with the Lakers, James was criticized for distancing himself from his younger teammates. During a bad loss to the Indiana Pacers, James was seen sitting several seats away from his teammates, many of whom were in trade rumors.\n\nESPN's Dave McMenamin reported in 2019 that Lakers players even called James out for his poor body language that season.\n\n\"[James] copped to the critique, telling his teammates that, in essence, cutting out behavior like slumped shoulders and sideways glances has been something he has tried to work on his entire career,\" McMenamin wrote.\n\nTeammates would go to battle with Jordan and James all over again\n\nThough neither are perfect in their leadership habits, many players have come away impressed by how both players approached the game.\n\nJefferson said James' willingness to shoulder the burden of leading the team impressed him.\n\n\"Not many people in the history of sports have said, 'Everyone get on my back,'\" Jefferson told ESPN. \"The city, state, organization, team … 'Get on my back. If we win or fail, I'll take the blame — but I'm going to lead you.'\n\n\"How many people have ever said that? I can't think of too many players who have put that type of pressure on themselves and then have delivered more times than not. And he embraces it.\"\n\nKyrie Irving, who later requested a trade from the Cavs to get out from under James' shadow, said after the 2017 Finals that learning from James changed his career.\n\n\"Man, he's freaking awesome,\" Irving told reporters. \"As a student of the game, it would be a disservice to myself if I didn't try to learn as much as possible while I'm playing with this guy. Every single day demanding more out of himself, demanding more out of us, the true testament of a consummate professional.\"\n\nIrving added: \"That's the type of guy that I want to be with every single time I'm going to war, because I know what to expect, and you stand your ground, too, with a leader like that.\"\n\nSimilarly, Armstrong marveled at the way Jordan rose to the occasion.\n\n\"You had no doubt that when he fell down, he was going to get back up,\" Armstrong said. \"And that was the thing that I admired most about him is every single thing he did. He was going to try his absolute best.\n\n\"How many people can say that? ... That was the lesson that I picked up very quickly from him, is I can try to be my very best every single time I do something, whatever the outcome is, I can live with the outcome. But what I can't live with is not doing my very best.\"\n\nRecommended video\n\nRead next\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\n\nJump to\n\n"

        "raw_content": "POPULAR SEARCHES\n\nBROWSE BY\n\nOld School vs. New School: How Jordan's and LeBron's leadership styles differ\n\nBy Melissa RohlinFOX Sports NBA reporter\n\nMichael Jordan and LeBron James have a lot in common.\n\nThey're two of the greatest basketball players of all time. They revolutionized the game. They inspired everyone around them.\n\nBut the ways they went about that differ tremendously.\n\nWhile Jordan was a ruthless leader, James has a gentler approach, often befriending his teammates and learning how to get through to them.\n\nScott Williams is one of four players who played alongside both, winning three championships with Jordan on the Chicago Bulls from 1990 to '93 and spending one season with James on the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2004-05.\n\nWilliams describes Jordan as having only one gear.\n\n\"I had him before he had a ring, so it was crazy intense, like scary intense,\" Williams told FOX Sports. \"It was almost an illness how hard he went at everything, including teammates, verbally and physically.\n\n\"Going to Bulls practices was similar to going to war. You're going to get hurt. And if you don't give your all at every moment, you're not going to survive.\"\n\nJordan wanted to play alongside guys who operated at a feverish pitch. If a player fell short of his lofty expectations, he wouldn't necessarily go to management and request the player be traded, but Jordan would make the player's life miserable on the court through a combination of verbal and physical assaults, leaving management no choice but to deal the player to another team.\n\nWilliams witnessed that phenomenon firsthand.\n\n\"One of the saddest things I ever saw in my pro career was watching him go against Dennis Hopson every day,\" Williams said of the shooting guard/small forward who played for the Bulls in 1990-91 before being traded after two games the following season. \"Hop was a good guy, but Hop was about the cars and the lifestyle and the parties and the girls. And Michael wasn't having any of that. He went at him so hard every day, Hop was a shell of himself by the time the season was over. They had to trade him.\"\n\nWilliams, who was undrafted out of the University of North Carolina in 1990, earned Jordan's respect with his work ethic and willingness to stand up to him.\n\nThey'd often play one-on-one after practice because Jordan, who was 6-foot-6, wanted to improve his low-post scoring game against taller defenders. After marathon practices, the 6-foot-10 Williams would spend hours exchanging trash talk and banging elbows and hips with the best player in the world, quickly learning their relationship worked only if he returned Jordan's physicality with forearm shivers of his own.\n\nThose matchups made Williams quicker and improved his instincts, and he had an enduring, 15-season professional career as a journeyman with the Bulls, Philadelphia 76ers, Milwaukee Bucks, Denver Nuggets, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Cavaliers.\n\nWilliams, who is now a color analyst for the Grand Canyon Antelope men's basketball team, said playing with Jordan wasn't always fun. But every June, he felt as though all of the blood, sweat, tears, bruises and loose teeth were worth it.\n\nAnd he said it prepared him for the rest of his life.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the result of when you survive stuff like that, you realize that anything else in life is easy,\" he said. \"Anything else after that is just easier. There's nothing else I've ever faced in life where I've thought, 'Wow, this is hard work.'\"\n\nJames has a very different modus operandi.\n\nWhile Jordan had only one mode, James has many. He's vocal but can communicate just as effectively with silence or body language. He can be positive and supportive. Other times, he screams and voices his frustration. He picks and chooses when he approaches guys, sometimes opting to do so on the court in front of other players and other times over private dinners.\n\nJames tailors his approach to the specific player.\n\nTo Lakers forward Jared Dudley, a 14-year veteran who has played alongside Steve Nash, Grant Hill, Chris Paul and Shaquille O'Neal, James' leadership style is different than anybody else's.\n\nJames, Dudley says, inspires players to work harder.\n\n\"LeBron is very unique where he's a guy's guy,\" Dudley said. \"He'll drink some wine with you. He'll have a one-on-one talk with you. And guys have looked up to him for a long time. So his words of encouragement, he knows what to say at the right time. He knows when to get on you.\n\n\"Let's be real, when you see LeBron's body language, it isn't high when he's frustrated or mad. And they know that. In a way, you want to play well for him, play well for yourself, because you know how [much work] he puts into his craft. You see what he does. You don't want to let him, yourself and [the] Lakers down.\"\n\nSince James joined the Lakers in free agency in 2018, he has promoted a feeling of inclusivity and acceptance in the locker room. He invited his teammates to his 35th birthday party in West Hollywood last season. He mentored reserve guard Quinn Cook. He made former Laker Dwight Howard feel at home in a locker room that was hostile to him seven years earlier. He has hosted Lakers superstar Anthony Davis for dinners at his home with his family.\n\nJames' leadership was pivotal to the Lakers' success last season, especially for Davis.\n\nDavis, who had never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, can be hard on himself. He's a perfectionist who can sink into a funk when he isn't playing up to his standards.\n\nJames learned to read Davis' body language and determine whether he needed a pep talk or space in those moments. When the timing was right, James would urge Davis to move forward and stop dwelling on the past.\n\nDavis said it made a huge difference for him.\n\n\"He’s like a bigger brother to me and helped me with things I need help with, on and off the floor,\" Davis said. \"So it’s been great to have him around and being able to call, text him whenever I need more support on anything, mainly on just trying to figure out everything. So it's been good just having him around. If he see things, he helps me. And if I have questions about anything, he’s always there picking up his phone or responding to a text to help me out.\"\n\nThat's not to say James isn't intense.\n\nJames has had yelling matches on the court with teammates. Earlier in his career, he sometimes used social media to send cryptic messages, famously tweeting in 2015, \"Stop trying to find a way to FIT-OUT and just FIT-IN,\" a note he later acknowledged was directed at his former Cavaliers teammate Kevin Love, among others.\n\nAt this stage of James' career, however, there's one thing that stands out to Lakers coach Frank Vogel: his approachability.\n\nIn the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida, where the Lakers spent nearly 100 days before winning their 17th NBA championship last fall, Vogel marveled at how accessible James made himself.\n\n\"On a regular basis, he’s down there eating with his teammates and being with his teammates, which is something you don’t always say about players of his caliber,\" Vogel said. \"I can’t say enough positive things about him as a leader and what he means to our franchise.\"\n\nJames' leadership style has changed throughout the years. When he entered the league at age 18 as the No. 1 pick by the Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA Draft, his approach was to observe what leadership traits worked best.\n\n\"You come into a professional league, you sit there, and you watch,\" James said. \"You become a sponge, and you see. You lead by example, you go out, and you practice hard and stick your head into film and try to get better every single day and just try to keep quiet because there are vets and things of that nature. You've got your coaching staff that does a lot of the talking. I was more of a sponge at 18, just watching, seeing.\"\n\nWilliams played with James during his second season in the NBA and was immediately impressed by his approach.\n\nJames befriended his older teammates, playing cards with them on flights. He asked Williams questions about Jordan and the Bulls, something other young players — perhaps surprisingly — failed to do. And he demonstrated an indefatigable work ethic.\n\n\"The kid worked hard,\" Williams said. \"He was a gym rat, whether it be in the weight room getting strong, which he was already pretty darn strong as a 19-year-old, but working on his outside shooting, his footwork. I think he wanted to show the guys that I'm here every day giving it my all. I expect everybody to do the same. So it wasn't so much what he talked about, it was what he demonstrated.\"\n\nJames became much more vocal over his next few years in the league, a transformation Williams witnessed after retiring in 2004 and becoming a color analyst for the Cavaliers who often attended team practices.\n\nJames went on to lead the Miami Heat to two championships in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers to a championship in 2016 and the Lakers to their first title in a decade last season.\n\n\"He's a world-class leader,\" said Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, who guided James from 2010 to 2014. \"He's always had instincts to lead, and now he's really made it an art. It's a competitive advantage, his leadership, and he's developed it each year that he's been in this league. And he's utilizing it more and more and more to have that multiplying effect.\"\n\nJames' leadership was never more on display it was than during the 2016 NBA Finals, when he helped the Cavaliers overcome a 3-1 series deficit against the Warriors to win the franchise's first title.\n\nTyronn Lue, who coached James during that time and played alongside Jordan in his final two seasons on the Washington Wizards from 2001 to '03, said the two men are much more alike than different.\n\nWhen asked to compare their leadership styles, Lue didn't hesitate.\n\n\"The same,\" said Lue, who now coaches the LA Clippers. \"I think they both wanted to win and would do anything it took to win.\"\n\nBoth players got the results they wanted.\n\nJordan won six championships. James trails him by two rings, but he is played arguably the best basketball of his career at age 36 for a Lakers team poised to compete for another title this season.\n\nPlaying alongside either of them is something teammates will never forget.\n\nWhen asked if he'd want his children to play with Jordan, Williams reluctantly said yes.\n\nIt was impossibly tough, too tough – but it changed his life.\n\n\"He looked out for me,\" Williams said. \"He got me my shoe contract at Nike. He didn't stop the vets from getting on me, but he made sure it didn't go too far. There was a little-big brother kind of thing there. But he also knew I needed to take my floaties off and be able to swim in the deep end.\"\n\nAs for Davis, he still sometimes has \"pinch me\" moments about being teammates with James.\n\nA big one came last postseason\n\nWhen the Lakers were on a team bus headed to a game, Davis came across a social media post that showed James in the top three all time of many major statistical categories. Davis, who attended James' basketball camp in Ohio when he was 15 years old, couldn't help but marvel at the fact that they were now competing for a championship together, and he decided to pour his heart out in a text to James, telling him how much he has inspired him throughout his career.\n\nImmediately after sending it, Davis became a bit worried.\n\n\"It felt kinda awkward to walk in the locker room, like, sending a heartfelt message to him, and now we're about to go play, and we're right next to each other,\" Davis said. \"I'm like, 'Damn, what's he gonna say?' 'Man, you soft,' or, 'You gonna send this before a game?' So it was kinda weird.\"\n\nBut James didn't say a word at the time.\n\nHe waited until after the game to acknowledge the text, knowing anything else would've embarrassed his teammate before an important game.\n\nFor James, being a leader is a delicate dance. It's something that requires patience and impeccable timing.\n\nEven though he's in the twilight of his career, it's still one of the most important aspects of his game that he continually works on.\n\n\"Leadership is not a one-day thing, not a one-trick pony,\" he said. \"It's an everyday thing, both on and off the floor. And I take full responsibility for that.\"\n\nMelissa Rohlin is an NBA reporter for FOX Sports.
