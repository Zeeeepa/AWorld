The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSport | Basketball\nLeague | National Basketball Association\nAwarded for | Most valuable playerof theNBA Finals\nHistory\nFirst award | 1969\nMost wins | Michael Jordan(6 awards)\nMost recent | Jaylen Brown(1st award)\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nContents\n\nWinners\n\n^ | Denotes player who is still active in the NBA\n* | Elected to theNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n§ | 1st time eligible for Hall of Fame in

          "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

Don't be the person yelling \"six rings\" with no backup plan.\nHere's a closer look at where the GOAT debate stands...\n(All stats current as of Jan. 29, 2025)\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season stats\nOn a per-game basis, Jordan is superior in the scoring department, but James grabs rebounds and dishes out assists at a higher rate. While both players are known for tenacious defense on the wing, Jordan finished first in the league in steals three times in his career. James has not yet claimed a steals title.\nMICHAEL JORDAN AUTHENTIC JERSEYS — BULLS, DREAM TEAM, UNC AND MORE\nSHOP NOW\nIn terms of longevity, James holds a clear advantage. The gap in total numbers will widen as long as James stays healthy, and he doesn't appear to be slowing down at age 40.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n30.1    Points  27.0\n6.2 Rebounds    7.5\n5.3 Assists 7.4\n2.3 Steals  1.5\n0.8 Blocks  0.7\n2.7 Turnovers   3.5\n38.3    Minutes 37.8\n49.7    Field goal %    50.6\n32.7    3-point %   34.9\n83.5    Free throw %    73.6\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n1,072   Games   1,534\n32,292  Points  41,474\n6,672   Rebounds    11,504\n5,633   Assists 11,385\n2,514   Steals  2,311\n893 Blocks  1,134\n2,924   Turnovers   5,374\n41,011  Minutes 58,059\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season advanced stats\nIt's all about which category you choose when it comes to advanced statistics. VORP and Win Shares favor James, but PER and Box Plus/Minus go to Jordan.\nPick a side, nerds! (That's a term of endearment.)\nJordan  Advanced    LeBron\n27.9    Player Efficiency Rating    27.0\n116.1   Value Over Replacement  154.5\n9.2 Box Plus/Minus  8.6\n214.0   Win Shares  267.7\n56.9    True Shooting % 59.0\n33.3    Usage % 31.5\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Playoff stats\nThe playoff statistics mirror what Jordan and James produce during the regular season. Despite James' increased usage and efficiency from beyond the arc over the course of his career, it's worth noting that he shoots the same percentage as Jordan from 3-point range.\nOh, and the lazy narrative claiming James shrinks in big games — his postseason lines are often more impressive than his regular-season performances. That's not a smart way to argue against him.\nJordan  Per Game    LeBron\n33.4    Points  28.4\n6.4 Rebounds    9.0\n5.7 Assists 7.2\n2.1 Steals  1.7\n0.9 Blocks  1.0\n3.1 Turnovers   3.6\n41.8    Minutes 41.3\n48.7    Field goal %    49.7\n33.2    3-point %   33.2\n82.8    Free throw %    74.1\nJordan  Totals  LeBron\n179 Games   287\n5,987   Points  8,162\n1,152   Rebounds    2,583\n1,022   Assists 2,067\n376 Steals  483\n158 Blocks  275\n546 Turnovers   1,034\n7,474   Minutes 11,858\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Playoff advanced stats\nJordan stands above James in PER, and he is the all-time playoff leader in Box Plus/Minus. But James tops everyone in VORP and Win Shares.\nSo, yeah, these guys are pretty good.\nJordan  Advanced    LeBron\n28.6    Player Efficiency Rating    27.9\n24.7    Value Over Replacement  36.1\n11.1    Box Plus/Minus  10.0\n39.8    Win Shares  58.7\n56.8    True Shooting % 58.4\n35.6    Usage % 31.7\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Accolades and awards\nAnd here's the big one. Jordan fans have championships in their back pockets. MJ went a perfect 6-0 in the NBA Finals and never needed a Game 7 to win those series.\nJames has gone 4-6 in his 10 NBA Finals appearances, but he also controlled the Eastern Conference with the Cavaliers and Heat for almost an entire decade.\nJordan  Accolades   LeBron\n6   Championships   4\n5   MVPs    4\n6   Finals MVPs 4\n11  All-NBA 20\n9   All-Defense 6\n14  All-Star    20\n10  Scoring titles  1\nJORDAN GREER\nJordan Greer has been with The Sporting News since 2015.

          "raw_content": "LeBron James vs Michael Jordan playoff records: Total sweeps, win and loss record, win percentage and more\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate will likely never stop. These two players are considered the best of all time, which is why many basketball fans love to debate who's better.\n\nNearly everyone knows that Jordan had a perfect 6-0 record in the NBA Finals. However, he had to go through many struggles to get there. LeBron, on the other hand, has won only four championships, but has advanced to the final stage 10 times.\n\nDue to the reports of LeBron James' retirement, let's take a look at how well these two legends performed in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate mostly ignores Jordan's playoff struggles\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate often ignores Jordan's early struggles in the playoffs. While the Chicago Bulls guard was 6-0 in the finals, he was eliminated several times in the first round.\n\nDuring his glorious career, Jordan was 119-60 in playoff games, winning 30 out of 37 (81.1%) series. His winning percentage was 66.4%, meaning that he won two out of three games on average.\n\nJordan was swept twice in his career, both times by the Boston Celtics. The first time this happened was in the 1986 NBA playoffs, and the second time was just a year later.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: Top 10 most undeserving NBA All-Star Selections of All Time featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan & more\n\nJordan's Chicago Bulls swept nine teams during his career. However, it's important to note that the NBA used the best-of-five series format in the first round while Jordan was in the league. Due to this, a sweep required only three wins.\n\nThe Bulls legend won nine out of 30 series with a sweep, meaning that he swept his opponent in 30% of the series, which is remarkable.\n\nLeBron James has been swept three times. The first time, James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the 2007 NBA Finals in four games. The second time was in the 2018 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, while the third time was against the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals.\n\nLeBron's all-time playoff record is 182-100, good enough for a 64.5% win percentage.

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.

The award is decided by a panel of eleven media members, who cast votes after the conclusion of the Finals. The person with the highest number of votes wins the award.[1] The award was originally a black trophy with a gold basketball-shaped sphere at the top, similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, until a new trophy was introduced in 2005.[2][3]\n\nSport | Basketball\nLeague | National Basketball Association\nAwarded for | Most valuable playerof theNBA Finals\nHistory\nFirst award | 1969\nMost wins | Michael Jordan(6 awards)\nMost recent | Jaylen Brown(1st award)\nSince its inception, the award has been given 55 times to 34 players. Michael Jordan is a record six-time award winner.[4] LeBron James has won the award four times in his career, and Magic Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Tim Duncan won three times each. Jordan and O'Neal are the only players to win the award in three consecutive seasons (Jordan accomplished the feat on two occasions). Johnson is the only rookie ever to win the award,[5] as well as the youngest at 20 years and 276 days old.[6][7] In 1985, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar became the oldest to win at 38 years and 54 days old.[8] Andre Iguodala is the only winner to have not started every game in the series.[9] Jerry West, the first awardee (1969), is the only person to win the award while being on the losing team.[4]\n\nWillis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,[a] Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant, Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant won the award twice. Olajuwon, Durant, Bryant, and James have won the award in two consecutive seasons. James is the only player to have won the award with three different teams,[10] while he and Leonard are the only players to have won the award in both conferences.[11] Johnson, Moses Malone, Durant, and Leonard are the only players to have been named Finals MVP in their first season with a team.[12] Olajuwon of Nigeria (who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1993), Tony Parker of France, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, and Nikola Jokić of Serbia are the only international players to win the award. Duncan is an American citizen, but is considered an \"international\" player by the NBA because he was not born in one of the fifty states or Washington, D.C.[13] Parker, Nowitzki, Antetokounmpo and Jokić are the only winners to have been trained totally outside the U.S.; Olajuwon played college basketball at Houston and Duncan at Wake Forest. Cedric Maxwell is the only Finals MVP winner eligible for the Hall of Fame who has not been voted in.[14]\n\nOn February 14, 2009, during the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the award would be renamed the \"Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award\" in honor of 11-time NBA champion Bill Russell.[15]\n\nContents\n\nWinners\n\n^ | Denotes player who is still active in the NBA\n* | Elected to theNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame\n§ | 1st time eligible for Hall of Fame in

            "raw_content": "Who is better LeBron or Jordan: After Lakers star broke scoring record, who is really the GOAT?\n\nWith each passing game, LeBron James, the newly crowned all-time scoring champion, puts more distance between himself and all those enshrined in basketball's hall of fame.\n\nAnd as he steps onto the court this Sunday in Salt Lake City, James will tie Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most NBA All-Star Game appearances – his 19th consecutive.\n\nSo is he finally the greatest of all time?\n\nAsk Google: \"best NBA player of all time.\" You get 394 million results in half a second. Whose picture appears in the top left corner? James. Directly to his right: Michael Jordan.\n\nSettled. Right?\n\nMaybe not. A link just below the photos says: \"Here's why Michael Jordan is still the greatest player of all time.\"\n\nLike any great sports debate, there's a strong argument for either to claim GOAT status. Career averages, games played, championships, honors. We'll walk you through a bunch.\n\nJordan vs. James: Per game averages\n\nJust consider Jordan's and James' averages. The numbers below would be career games for the majority of NBA players – not just what you could expect from both of them each time they walked onto the court.\n\nJordan has a relatively large points-per-game lead over James, but James' two extra assists per game ultimately led to more points per game for his teams. And even though he's the NBA scoring leader, it's unlikely James will ever eclipse Jordan's scoring average – even thought he's been a 30-point scorer this season and last.\n\nEdge: No clear winner\n\nJordan vs. James: Career points\n\nYes, there can be some Jordan bias here.\n\nJames is the NBA's all-time scoring leader, but Jordan hit major scoring milestones well ahead of James throughout his career. Some may say James has an advantage because scoring has been easier in this era. Yes, 3-pointers play a bigger role in today's game, but the average team scored just over 102 points in both of their eras.\n\nEdge: James. Breaking Abdul-Jabbar's 39-year-old record should mean something.\n\nGames played per season since entering the NBA\n\n\"Load management,\" aka taking games off to recharge, has changed expectations during James' era. He's played all 82 regular season games once in his 20-year career.  Jordan played all 82 in nine of his 15 seasons, including three consecutive seasons in the Bulls' last three championship seasons.\n\nEdge: Another toss up because their paths and eras are so different. Jordan missed just two regular-season games as he successfully completed two championship runs with a 1992 Olympic gold medal sandwiched in between. James had a similar run with the Miami Heat and a few more days off. He's also persisted for 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers.\n\nPoints per shot attempt\n\nJames' and Jordan's shooting efficiency (total points per shot attempt) crisscrossed early in their careers, but James created some separation from his sixth year on. He topped out at 1.5 points per shot in his final two years with the Heat. The NBA average has been about 1.2 points per shot attempt throughout the past 40 years – a mark Jordan fell below three times following times away from the game.\n\nEdge: James. He's never fallen below the league average after his first season – even as he's drawn most team's top defenders.\n\nPoints per season\n\nJordan only fell below James' points per season when he broke his foot in his second season and when he returned from each of his retirements. One of those began with a partial season shortly after he gave up his baseball dream with the Birmingham (Alabama) Barons.\n\nEdge: Jordan. In addition to outscoring James in 11 of their first 15 seasons, Jordan holds 10 scoring titles to James' one.\n\nJordan vs. James: Advanced metrics\n\nEven with advanced metrics which try to balance differences in eras, you can make a case for either.\n\nIn \"value over replacement,\" the all-encompassing number of a player's value, James leads everyone who has ever played by a sizable margin. Some of the 30-point difference between him and Jordan can be attributed to his longevity, but grinding through 20 years as one of the NBA's top performers is remarkable.\n\nEdge: James. The two are so close on these and many other metrics, but James' value over replacement easily tips the balance. For what it's worth, only James, Jordan and John Stockton have values over 100.\n\nJordan vs. James: Honors and awards\n\nOthers will argue that the way the game was or is played in any era can't be fully reflected in any set of statistics. The piles of awards and honors that Jordan and James have accumulated tilt toward Jordan, but both are GOAT-worthy.\n\nEdge: Jordan. He leads in four out of these six categories. Just how many more awards would Jordan have accumulated if he had not taken a break for baseball or the Bulls had held their core together after their second threepeat?\n\nJordan vs. James: NBA championships\n\nThe GOAT discussion often concludes with who has helped their team to the most championships. With Jordan and James, the comparison is, again, difficult.\n\nSure, Jordan never lost an NBA championship series in his six trips with the Chicago Bulls. His teams also never played a Game 7.\n\nJames, though, brought three organizations to 10 series (eight consecutive) and won a championship for each team. Of course, it took a second tour with the Cavaliers to bring the NBA trophy to his home state.\n\nEdge: Jordan. Two more championships and a more challenging task to build championship teams in Jordan's era – unlike the James era when he took his talents to Miami and teamed with All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh.\n\nCan Team Jordan be converted to Team James?\n\nThere's a lot of data points on either side, but James probably has a few more to make.\n\nJordan completed his résumé in 2009 when he took his place in the Basketball Hall of Fame. At 38, James is two years younger than Jordan was when he retired, and in interviews after James broke the scoring record, he sounded as if he still has unfinished business.\n\nTwo more championships? As NBA moves into the All-Star break, it appears a fifth championship might be out of his reach this season: The Lakers are closer to a play-in spot than a top seed.\n\n40,000 points? Even if James' 30-point per game scoring pace slows in the last 23 games of the season, he's on pace to finish the season with more than 39,000 career points. That would likely put him less than a season away from becoming the NBA's first 40,000-point scorer.\n\nPlaying with his son? Bronny James, a promising basketball player himself, is a high school senior and won't be eligible for the NBA Draft until 2024. James would be 40 years old just a few months into the 2024-25 season.\n\n"

For those who witnessed Jordan's excellence over the course of two three-peats with the Bulls, it reinforced the belief that he is the greatest player to ever touch the court.\nA current star has complicated that GOAT (greatest of all time) conversation, of course. There is an argument to be made for putting LeBron James over Jordan, and James' case only grew stronger after he became the first player in NBA history to reach 40,000 career points.\nThe Sporting News' Bill Bender has a helpful guide with the most important talking points if you're ready to discuss MJ vs. LeBron, but we're simply here to provide the facts you need to justify your choice. Don't be the person yelling \"six rings\" with no backup plan.\nHere's a closer look at where the GOAT debate stands...\n(All stats current as of Jan. 29, 2025)\nMichael Jordan vs. LeBron James: Regular season stats\nOn a per-game basis, Jordan is superior in the scoring department, but James grabs rebounds and dishes out assists at a higher rate. While both players are known for tenacious defense on the wing, Jordan finished first in the league in steals three times in his career. James has not yet claimed a steals title.\nMICHAEL JORDAN AUTHENTIC JERSEYS — BULLS, DREAM TEAM, UNC AND MORE\nSHOP NOW\nIn terms of longevity, James holds a clear advantage.

Despite James' increased usage and efficiency from beyond the arc over the course of his career, it's worth noting that he shoots the same percentage as Jordan from 3-point range.\nOh, and the lazy narrative claiming James shrinks in big games — his postseason lines are often more impressive than his regular-season performances.

            "raw_content": "LeBron James vs Michael Jordan playoff records: Total sweeps, win and loss record, win percentage and more\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate will likely never stop. These two players are considered the best of all time, which is why many basketball fans love to debate who's better.\n\nNearly everyone knows that Jordan had a perfect 6-0 record in the NBA Finals. However, he had to go through many struggles to get there. LeBron, on the other hand, has won only four championships, but has advanced to the final stage 10 times.\n\nDue to the reports of LeBron James' retirement, let's take a look at how well these two legends performed in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate mostly ignores Jordan's playoff struggles\n\nThe LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate often ignores Jordan's early struggles in the playoffs. While the Chicago Bulls guard was 6-0 in the finals, he was eliminated several times in the first round.\n\nDuring his glorious career, Jordan was 119-60 in playoff games, winning 30 out of 37 (81.1%) series. His winning percentage was 66.4%, meaning that he won two out of three games on average.\n\nJordan was swept twice in his career, both times by the Boston Celtics. The first time this happened was in the 1986 NBA playoffs, and the second time was just a year later.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: Top 10 most undeserving NBA All-Star Selections of All Time featuring Shaquille O'Neal, Michael Jordan & more\n\nJordan's Chicago Bulls swept nine teams during his career. However, it's important to note that the NBA used the best-of-five series format in the first round while Jordan was in the league. Due to this, a sweep required only three wins.\n\nThe Bulls legend won nine out of 30 series with a sweep, meaning that he swept his opponent in 30% of the series, which is remarkable.\n\nLeBron James has been swept three times. The first time, James was with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who lost the 2007 NBA Finals in four games. The second time was in the 2018 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, while the third time was against the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 Western Conference Finals.\n\nLeBron's all-time playoff record is 182-100, good enough for a 64.5% win percentage. He won 41 out of 53 (77.3%) playoff series, but many fans use his 4-6 NBA Finals record against him, especially in the LeBron James vs Michael Jordan debate.\n\nYou may be interested in reading: What did Michael Jordan say on LeBron James breaking all-time scoring record?\n\nWhen it comes to victorious sweeps, the four-time NBA champion has done this 11 times. LeBron's sweep percentage is 26.8%, which is slowly lower than Jordan's, but still impressive.\n\nAsmir Pekmic\n\n​Besides playing basketball both in video games and in real life, Asmir is a longtime fan of the Miami Heat. Even though Dwyane Wade, his favorite player, retired, he still finds joy in watching the current squad ​​led by Jimmy Butler. By the age of 30, he's seen many fantastic moments, but Ray Allen's \"The Shot\" and D-Wade's game-winning buzzer-beater against the Bulls are his favorites. \n\nAsmir comes from Bosnia and Herzegovina and he's been with Sportskeeda since May 2022.\n\nMiami Heat Nation!

            "raw_content": "Michael Jordan vs LeBron James: Comparing NBA Finals Stats of the Two Leading GOAT Candidates\n\nShubham Singh|PublishedFeb 05, 2024\n\nMichael Jordan and LeBron James. Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nNBA enthusiasts love to get into the GOAT debate and it is usually fixated around LeBron James and Michael Jordan. While there are various ways to contrast their contributions, looking at their NBA Finals stats can be a strong methodology. So how did two of the greatest players perform at the highest level of competition?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJordan is often given the edge when it comes to the Finals because he has a 6-0 record, implying two more titles than LBJ. While James has made four additional trips to the biggest stage, he has lost six times. Therefore, a look at the overall stats for both players can carve out an interesting picture nonetheless.\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nJordan played in 35 Finals games from 1991-1993 and 1996-1998. In these, he had an incredible 24-11 record and no Finals series featuring Jordan reached seven games. The high-flying athlete won the MVP during all six Finals. He notched 33.6 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game while committing 2.4 turnovers a game. He shot 48.1% from the floor and 80.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nJordan bagged 1,176 points, 211 rebounds, 209 assists, 62 steals, and 23 blocks in the Finals. Jordan’s best Finals performance was in 1993 against Charles Barkley and the Suns which included a 55-point explosion during Game 4. For the series, he tallied a mind-boggling 41 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists while shooting over 50%.\n\nJordan’s 41 points per game Finals average remains the top-most in the league’s history. His overall average of 33.6 points per game is only second to Rick Barry who put up 36 points per game.\n\nHowever, one huge difference is that Barry played in 10 finals games, unlike Jordan who did in 25 more games. For his Finals career, Jordan had a plus-minus of 10.9, a PER of 31.5, and a game score of 24.7, which are all extraordinary numbers.\n\nLeBron James\n\nCompared to MJ, James has featured in 55 Finals games thus far. He has a 22-33 record in the finals, meaning that he is yet to touch MJ’s Finals total wins despite featuring in four more series. In terms of numbers, James has impressive figures of 28.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.8 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 48.4% from the floor, 73.1% from the free-throw line, and 35.2% from the three-point line.\n\nSo far LBJ has compiled 1562 points, 561 rebounds, 430 assists, 93 steals, and 46 blocks in the final. His 2014-15 Finals can be tabbed as the most impressive performance in terms of numbers. Although he lost the series 2-4 against the Warriors, he put up a herculean 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game including a 44-point effort in Game 1.\n\nBut he shot just 39%, so in terms of efficiency, he did take a hit. Apart from that, he has repeatedly shot over 50% during Finals and has gone past the 28 points per game mark in seven out of ten finals series. With 11 triple-doubles, James leads the NBA Finals pack. In terms of minus-plus, James has 9.5, a PER of 29.1, and a Game Score of 23.1.\n\nMichael Jordan vs. Lebron James – NBA Finals statistical comparison.\n\nMJ clears and it’s not really close.\n\nYet another reason why this media-manufactured GOAT debate really needs to stop. pic.twitter.com/5IqfKDTNxY\n\n— The NBA Realist (@nbarealist23) February 5, 2024\n\nBoth the GOAT candidates are neck-to-neck in various metrics. While Jordan never lost three games in a Finals series, James’ ability to make the Finals trip consistently is laudable. Therefore, even the NBA Finals comparison will only further divide opinions.\n\nEven then, as per the numbers, MJ seems to be ahead in the race once again, which surely proves his dominance in the league even to this day.\n\nPost Edited By:Hitesh Nigam\n\nAbout the author\n\nShubham Singh\n\nShubham Singh is an NBA Journalist at SportsRush.
