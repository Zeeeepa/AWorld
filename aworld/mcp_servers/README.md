# MCP Servers

## Overview

The MCP (Model-Controller-Processor) Servers provide a modular and extensible framework for handling various computational tasks. Each server is designed to perform specific operations, such as mathematical computations, document processing, or web interactions, using a consistent interface and robust error handling.

## Main Purpose

The primary purpose of the MCP Servers is to offer a scalable and flexible solution for executing complex tasks across different domains. By leveraging a microservices architecture, each server can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled, allowing for efficient resource management and easy integration with other systems.

## Implementation Logic

The MCP Servers are implemented using a combination of Python and various third-party libraries. Each server follows a similar structure:

1. **Initialization**: Each server initializes its environment, including loading necessary configurations and importing required packages.

2. **Function Registration**: Core functionalities are encapsulated in functions, which are registered with the server. These functions handle specific tasks, such as solving equations or processing documents.

3. **Server Execution**: The server is started using a utility function that sets up the necessary environment, assigns a port, and begins listening for incoming requests.

## Use Case Example

### Launching MCP Servers

The `launcher.py` script provides a unified entry point for starting all MCP servers. Here's how you can use it to launch the servers:

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed and the environment is properly configured.

2. **Run the Launcher**: Execute the `launcher.py` script to start all MCP servers. The script will automatically allocate ports and manage the server processes.
